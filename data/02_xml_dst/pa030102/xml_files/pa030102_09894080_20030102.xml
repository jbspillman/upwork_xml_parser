<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates in general to preventing the production of particulate materials through a wellbore traversing an unconsolidated or loosely consolidated subterranean formation and, in particular, to an apparatus and method for progressively gravel packing an interval of the wellbore. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> It is well known in the subterranean well drilling and completion art that relatively fine particulate materials may be produced during the production of hydrocarbons from a well that traverses an unconsolidated or loosely consolidated formation. Numerous problems may occur as a result of the production of such particulates. For example, the particulates cause abrasive wear to components within the well, such as tubing, pumps and valves. In addition, the particulates may partially or fully clog the well creating the need for an expensive workover. Also, if the particulate matter is produced to the surface, it must be removed from the hydrocarbon fluids using surface processing equipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> One method for preventing the production of such particulate material to the surface is gravel packing the well adjacent to the unconsolidated or loosely consolidated production interval. In a typical gravel pack completion, a sand control screen is lowered into the wellbore on a workstring to a position proximate the desired production interval. A fluid slurry including a liquid carrier and a relatively coarse particulate material, which is typically sized and graded and which is referred to herein as gravel, is then pumped down the workstring and into the well annulus formed between the sand control screen and the perforated well casing or open hole production zone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The liquid carrier either flows into the formation or returns to the surface by flowing through a wash pipe or both. In either case, the gravel is deposited around the sand control screen to form the gravel pack, which is highly permeable to the flow of hydrocarbon fluids but blocks the flow of the fine particulate materials carried in the hydrocarbon fluids. As such, gravel packs can successfully prevent the problems associated with the production of these particulate materials from the formation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It has also been found, however, that it is difficult to completely gravel pack the production interval. This is particularly true in long or inclined/horizontal production intervals. The resulting incomplete gravel packs are commonly caused by entry of the liquid carrier into permeable sections of the production interval creating sand bridge formation in the annulus. Thereafter, the sand bridge prevents the gravel pack slurry from flowing to the remainder of the annulus which, in turn, prevents the placement of sufficient gravel in the remainder of the annulus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Therefore a need has arisen for an apparatus and method that is capable of producing a substantially complete gravel pack of the wellbore adjacent to the production interval to prevent the production of fine particulate materials when production from the formation commences. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The present invention disclosed herein comprises an apparatus and method that is capable of producing a substantially complete gravel pack of the wellbore adjacent to the production interval to prevent the production of fine particulate materials when production commences. The apparatus and method of the present invention achieves this result by progressively gravel packing the production interval from one end to the other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The apparatus comprises a sand control screen that is positioned within the wellbore and a tubular member also positioned within the wellbore forming a first annulus with the sand control screen and a second annulus with the wellbore. The tubular member initially substantially prevents fluid communication between the first annulus and the second annulus. Thereafter, the tubular member selectively allows fluid communication from the first annulus to the second annulus by progressively establishing fluid communication between the first annulus and the second annulus from a first end to a second end of the interval. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The tubular member may include a perforated pipe having a plurality of removable members positioned on the interior or the exterior of the perforated pipe. The removable members may alternatively be positioned within the wellbore without being associated with a perforated pipe. In either case, the removable members may be propellant or other combustible material members each having an initiator. The initiators may be activated by a wireless telemetry system. Alternatively, the initiators may have pressure activated firing devices that are positioned such that the pressure required to fire the pressure activated firing devices progressively increasing from the first end to the second end interval. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The removable members may alternatively be friable members that are progressively removable from the first end to the second end of the interval. Each friable member may include a pressure actuated vibration generator. In this case, the pressure actuated vibration generators are positioned within the wellbore such that the pressure required to activate the pressure actuated vibration generators progressively increasing from the first end to the second end of the interval. Alternatively, each of the friable members may have a vibration generator that activated by a wireless telemetry system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The tubular member may alternatively comprises a perforated pipe having an actuatable device disposed within each perforation. The actuatable devices may be rupture disks, pressure actuated one-way valves or other pressure actuated devices that are positioned within the perforated pipe such that the pressure required to actuate the actuatable devices progressively increases from the first end to the second end of the interval. Alternatively, the actuatable device may be progressively actuated from the first end to the second end of the interval by a wireless telemetry system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In all embodiments, the gravel pack may progress from the top of the interval to the bottom, the bottom of the interval to the top, the heel of the interval to the toe or the toe of the interval to the heel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The method of the present invention comprises traversing a formation with the wellbore, locating a sand control screen within the wellbore proximate the formation, positioning a tubular member within the wellbore that forms a first annulus between the tubular member and the sand control screen and a second annulus between the tubular member and the wellbore, initially substantially preventing fluid communication between the first annulus and the second annulus, injecting a fluid slurry containing gravel into the first annulus, progressively establishing fluid communication between the first annulus and the second annulus from a first end to a second end of the interval and terminating the injecting when the interval is substantially completely packed with the gravel. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> While the making and using of various embodiments of the present invention are discussed in detail below, it should be appreciated that the present invention provides many applicable inventive concepts which can be embodied in a wide variety of specific contexts. The specific embodiments discussed herein are merely illustrative of specific ways to make and use the invention, and do not delimit the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Referring initially to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an apparatus for progressively gravel packing an interval of a wellbore operating from an offshore oil and gas platform is schematically illustrated and generally designated <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. A semi-submersible platform <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is centered over a submerged oil and gas formation <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> located below sea floor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. A subsea conduit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> extends from deck <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of platform <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to wellhead installation <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> including blowout preventers <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Platform <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has a hoisting apparatus <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and a derrick <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> for raising and lowering pipe strings such as work string <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> A wellbore <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> extends through the various earth strata including formation <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. A casing <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is cemented within wellbore <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> by cement <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Work string <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> includes various tools including apparatus <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> for progressively gravel packing an interval of wellbore <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> adjacent to formation <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Apparatus <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> includes a cross-over assembly <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and a gravel packing assembly <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> which is used to gravel pack the production interval <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> between packers <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. When it is desired to gravel pack interval <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, work string <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is lowered through casing <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> until apparatus <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is positioned adjacent to formation <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> including perforations <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, a fluid slurry containing gravel is pumped down work string <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> through apparatus <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to progressively gravel pack interval <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Even though <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> depicts a vertical well, it should be noted by one skilled in the art that the apparatus for progressively gravel packing an interval of a wellbore of the present invention is equally well-suited for use in deviated wells, inclined wells or horizontal wells. Also, even though <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> depicts an offshore operation, it should be noted by one skilled in the art that the apparatus for progressively gravel packing an interval of a wellbore of the present invention is equally well-suited for use in onshore operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, therein is depicted a more detailed illustration of apparatus <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. As illustrated, apparatus <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> includes cross-over assembly <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, a screen assembly <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, gravel packing assembly <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and a wash pipe <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Apparatus <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is connected to work string <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> extending from the surface, which lowers apparatus <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> into wellbore <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> until screen assembly <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is properly positioned adjacent to formation <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Gravel packing apparatus <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> forms an annulus <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> with screen assembly <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and an annulus <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> with casing <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Screen assembly <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is designed to allow fluid to flow therethrough but prevent particulate matter of sufficient size from flowing therethrough. The exact design of screen assembly <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is not critical to the present invention as long as it is suitably designed for the characteristics of the formation fluids and the gravel pack slurry. For example, as illustrated, screen assembly <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> may include a perforated base pipe <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> having a wire <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> wrapped directly thereon. Alternatively, a plurality of ribs may be placed around the base pipe to provide stand off between the base pipe and the wire wrap. Another suitable alternative is to use a screen assembly having a sinterred wire mesh or sinterred metal between the base pipe and an outer housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiment, gravel packing apparatus <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> includes an axially extending substantially tubular member <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> that includes a perforated pipe <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and a plurality of progressively removable members <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>E disposed on the interior of perforated pipe <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. Removable members <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>E may be constructed from a variety of materials such as combustible materials, referred to herein as propellants, that are removable by combustion, friable materials, including ceramics, that are removable by disintegration, or other materials that are removable in a downhole environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> When removable members <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>E are constructed from propellants, suitable initiators are attached to each removable member <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>E such that the combustion process of each removable member <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>E may be triggered independently. The initiators may be operated using a variety of known techniques including pressure actuation, electrical actuation, acoustic actuation or the like. For example, as explained in more detail below, the pressure generated by the fluid slurry containing gravel can be used to trigger the initiators. Alternatively, a wireless telemetry system can be used wherein pressure pulses, electromagnetic waves, acoustic signals or the like are used to the operate the initiators. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> When removable members <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>E are constructed from friable materials, suitable vibration generators are attached to each removable member <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>E such that the disintegration process of each removable member <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>E may be triggered independently. The vibration generators may be operated using a variety of known techniques including pressure actuation, electrical actuation, acoustic actuation or the like. For example, as explained in more detail below, the pressure generated by the fluid slurry containing gravel can be used to trigger the vibration generators. Alternatively, a wireless telemetry system can be used wherein pressure pulses, electromagnetic waves, acoustic signals or the like are used to the operate the vibration generators. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> To begin the completion process, interval <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> adjacent to formation <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is isolated. Packer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> seals the upper end of interval <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and packer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> seals the lower end of interval <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Cross-over assembly <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is located adjacent to screen assembly <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, traversing packer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> with portions of cross-over assembly <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> on either side of packer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. When the gravel packing operation commences, the objective is to uniformly and completely fill interval <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> with gravel. To help achieve this result, wash pipe <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is disposed within screen assembly <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. Wash pipe <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> extends into cross-over assembly <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> such that return fluid passing through screen assembly <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, indicated by arrows <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, may travel through wash pipe <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, as indicated by arrow <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, and into annulus <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, as indicted by arrow <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, for return to the surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The fluid slurry containing gravel <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is pumped down work string <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> into cross-over assembly <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> along the path indicated by arrows <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> As can be seen, using the apparatus for progressively packing an interval of a wellbore of the present invention, the gravel pack progresses from one end of interval <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> toward the other end as fluid communication is progressively allowed between annulus <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and annulus <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. Also, as should be apparent to those skilled in the art, even though FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> present the apparatus for progressively gravel packing an interval of a wellbore of the present invention in a vertical orientation with packer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> at the top of interval <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and packer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> at the bottom of interval <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, these figures are intended to also represent wellbores that have alternate directional orientations such as inclined wellbores and horizontal wellbore. In the horizontal orientation, for example, packer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is at the heel of interval <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and packer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is at the toe of interval <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Likewise, even though FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> present the apparatus for progressively gravel packing an interval of a wellbore of the present invention performing a progressive gravel pack from the bottom of the interval to the top of the interval, in the vertical orientation, or the toe of the interval to heel of the interval, in the horizontal orientation, those skilled in the art will understand that the apparatus for progressively gravel packing an interval of a wellbore of the present invention can alternatively be configured to progressively gravel pack from the top of the interval to the bottom of the interval, in the vertical orientation, or the heel of the interval to toe of the interval, in the horizontal orientation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> As stated above, there are numerous ways to remove removable members <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> from perforated pipe <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to progressively establish fluid communication between annulus <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and annulus <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. One preferred method allows the pressure created by the fluid slurry within annulus <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> to progressively trigger the removal of removable member <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. For example, when the removable members <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> are constructed of propellant material, pressure activated firing devices may be attached to initiators that are coupled on each of the removable members <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. The pressure activated firing devices are then positioned within wellbore <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> such that the pressure required to fire the pressure activated firing devices progressively increases from the end of interval <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> toward cross-over assembly <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Each adjacent pressure activated firing device may be set to fire at an incremental pressure above the prior pressure activated firing device such as at increments of between about 50-100 psi. This assures a proper progression of the gravel pack by preventing any out of sequence activations. In addition, this approach is particularly advantageous in that the incremental pressure increase of adjacent pressure activated firing devices helps to insure that each section of the gravel pack is tightly packed prior to initiating the gravel packing of subsequent sections. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, a wireless telemetry system may be used to progressively trigger the removal of removable member <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. For example, when the removable members <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> are constructed of a friable material, vibration generators may be coupled on each of the removable members <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. Each vibration generator is activated by a particular wireless signal addressed specifically for that vibration generator. This assures a proper progression of the gravel pack by preventing any out of sequence activations. The wireless signals may be manually or automatically sent based upon the pressure response in annulus <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. For example, the wireless signal to remove the next removable member <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> may be sent each time the pressure within annulus <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> reaches a particular level or each time the pressure within annulus <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> reaches the next preselected pressure increment. As with the direct pressure response method, the particular removal sequence should insure that each section of the gravel pack is tightly packed prior to initiating the gravel packing of subsequent sections. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In operation, the apparatus for progressively gravel packing an interval of a wellbore of the present invention is used to progressively distribute the fluid slurry containing gravel to various locations within the interval to be gravel packed by progressively allowing fluid communication between a first annulus and a second annulus. As this fluid communication is sequentially established in adjacent sections of the interval, the gravel in the fluid slurry fills that section of the interval from the formation to the sand control screen. This process progresses along the entire length of the interval such that the interval becomes completely packed with the gravel. Once the interval is completely packed with gravel, the gravel pack operation may cease. As such, once the gravel pack is complete and the well is brought on line, formation fluids that are produced into the gravel packed interval must travel through the gravel pack in the interval, prior to entering the screen assembly, thereby filtering out any particulate materials in the formation fluid. </paragraph>
