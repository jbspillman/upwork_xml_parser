<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to rotating machines such as electric motors and generators and, more particularly, to cooling the field windings of the stator of electric motors, alternators and generators. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> There have been very many proposals intended to improve the operation of transducers for electrical power/mechanical power conversion (motors, generators, or alternators). However, there are still areas where the use of electric motors remains impractical, for example for use as the main drive of a vehicle such as an automobile. Present electric motors are generally too large, heavy, and produce too little power (especially at high speed) for commercial use in a vehicle such as an automobile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> One problem associated with electrical machines, such as electric motors, is that it is necessary to cool them because they generate heat which reduces their efficiency. Motors that are driven by inverters have a high frequency component of current in their windings due to the high frequency pulse width modulation of the inverter. This high frequency component adds to the losses in the stator winding by both the increased RMS current it represents and by the skin and proximity effects in the wire. Conductor losses in a motor represent a large part of the total losses in a well designed motor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> At present, such machines may be cooled by blowing air through or over them. For heavy duty applications it is known to spray oil onto the rotor and stator assemblies and into the gap between them using a high pressure pump. A scavenger pump may also be provided to collect the sprayed oil for re-cycling. The need for optimization in cooling is even more important as some applications of electric motors demand high efficiency in compact packages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A common configuration for such motors is to have an inner rotor mounted on a straight shaft supported by bearings on the ends. The bearings are mounted in end covers that support and locate the rotor in the center of a current-carrying stator. The rotor contains multiple current-carrying bars which run length wise parallel to the shaft and are located near the outer circumference of the rotor. Heat is produced in the rotor and stator when the current in the stator excites the bars. Heat dissipation limits the design of the stator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In a typical electric rotating machine where heat dissipation is required, it is customary to circulate a cooling medium in the outer structural jacket of the machine if the cooling medium is a liquid. Whereas, if the medium is air, the flow is then routed through the center and outside shell of the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A transverse cross-section of the stator field windings of a prior-art motor is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In this design, the electromagnetic conductors <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are housed in a slot <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of a stator <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The conductors <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are cooled by the longitudinal flow of a synthetic oil between the interstices of the wires large external radii and the region formed by an interior wall of a slot liner <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Maintaining this cross-sectional area open along the longitudinal axis of the stator <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> has proven to be very problematic during the manufacturing process of the motor and this creates a high fluid flow pressure drop. This problem ultimately manifests itself when the fixed power output of the oil pump delivery system cannot deliver the designed mass flow of the oil that is needed to sufficiently cool the conductors <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> where enormous heat is generated due to internal electrical resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> This particular electric motor designed for an electric vehicular application produces 450 lb-ft of torque and 250 HP at normal steady state conditions but coolant oil leaking from the stator slots into the air gap between the stator and rotor bodies causes hydrodynamic drag which leads to significant power transmission inefficiencies. Furthermore, the incessant impact of the rotor into this entrapped oil causes hardware damage due to cavitation and heat build up. Thus, the cooling oil meant to absorb the heat from the conductors <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> typically leaks from the interstices, causing an obstruction to the mechanical function of the motor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The process to form these interstices in each slot <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is tedious and fraught with manufacturing risk. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>illustrate this. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>illustrates Nomex/Kapton/Nomex (NKN) slot liners <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> which are placed in each stator slot <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> followed by a pair of pre-formed solid magnetic conductors <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. A center stick <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> made of a modified fiberglass cloth saturated with a high temperature phenolic resin (PCGP-HT) material placed between them separates the upper and lower conductors <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, four 0.030 inch diameter steel wires <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are then inserted into the interstitial space between the conductors <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and slot liners <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, a PCGP-HT top stick <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is then carefully inserted into place. After making the welded connections on the wires and buss ring terminals, the entire stator sub-assembly is then dipped into a bath of Doryl B-109-9 electrical insulating varnish under vacuum. After the excess varnish is drained, the stator sub-assembly is placed in a curing oven. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, half way through the curing process, taking great care so as not to tear the slot liner <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, the four steel wires <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are then gently pulled out and removed to expose the interstitial oil cooling flow passages <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. The curing process is continued so that the remaining varnish coating will form a secondary dielectric insulation <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> on the magnet wires as well as fuse the slot liner end papers and steel laminates, thus forming a means of primary containment for the cooling oil along with maintaining oil flow passages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> There are major problems associated with this cooling design and methodology. Keeping the interstitial area open along the longitudinal axis of the stator has proven to be very problematic since manufacturing variation in the cross-section tends to create relatively high fluid flow pressure drops. Another issue is that the varnish, being a thin liquid, does not completely fill the gaps between the slot liner end papers, top sticks and the steel laminates, thus compromising the integrity of the oil&apos;s primary containment. However, the biggest issue with this sealing technique is that incurred by the large temperature differential of 140 degrees Centigrade between the inner diameter of the stator and the outside diameter of its aluminum alloy casting. The different thermal coefficients of expansion of the elements, mainly in the stator slots, create a complex system of 3-dimensional expansion and contraction due to this temperature differential of the operating motor. This movement creates such stresses in these sealing joints that the glass-like crystalline structure of the varnish tends to fracture. Thus, these differential thermal expansions and contractions lead to the destruction of any sealing provided by the varnish. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> All these problems can be compounded to such a magnitude that the pressurized oil coolant will breach any flaw in its containment and flow radially towards the center of the stator, filling the air gap between the stator and rotor. At the relatively low speeds of 5,000 RPM or less, the cooling medium is churned and ground by the spinning rotor causing a drag force and hence mechanical losses to the output of the motor. At the maximum operating speed of 15,000 RPM, the cooling medium is subjected to heavy churning which not only results in major propulsion inefficiency, but causes high, localized temperatures that breaks down the oil&apos;s viscosity and hence, cooling capacity. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Therefore it is an object of the present invention to provide a rotating machine with cooled stator field windings having internal passages which provide an increased amount of cooling than is provided by prior art methods for cooling rotating machines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In order to increase heat conduction away from the field windings of a stator of a rotating machine, oil coolant is passed through longitudinal passages defined in at least one of the field windings. The rotating machine of the present invention utilizes a unique design that is much more thermally robust than the traditional solid conductor approach. This principle has been demonstrated to be readily manufacturable and resides within the economic producibility of the motor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In summary, there is provided an improved rotating machine. The improved rotating machine of the present invention comprises: a stator having a plurality of field winding slots; a plurality of field windings disposed in each of the field winding slots, at least two of the field windings are comprised of: an outer jacket; and a plurality of conductive wires disposed within and enclosed by the jacket such that longitudinal passages are defined therebetween; and circulation means for circulating a coolant into and from the rotating machine through the longitudinal passages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In a preferred implementation of the rotating machine of the present invention, a housing is further provided. The housing has a cavity for acceptance of the stator therein. The housing and stator define first and second plenums at first and second ends of the stator. The coolant enters the rotating machine into the first plenum and exits the rotating machine from the second plenum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The at least one field winding having the longitudinal passages preferably has at least one entry hole in the outer jacket which provides communication between the longitudinal passages and the first plenum and at least one exit hole in the outer jacket which provides communication between the longitudinal passages and the second plenum, wherein the coolant enters the longitudinal passages from the first plenum through the at least one entry hole and exits into the second plenum through the at least one exit hole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The circulation means preferably comprises a pump disposed in an external conduit between the first and second plenums. A heat exchanger is also preferably disposed in the external conduit between the first and second ends for removing heat from the coolant re-circulated therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The rotating machine of the present invention further comprises an inpregnant disposed in the slots to seal the spaces between the outer jackets and walls of the slots.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Although this invention is applicable to numerous and various types of rotating machines, it has been found particularly useful in the environment of electric motors and generators. Therefore, without limiting the applicability of the invention to electric motors and generators, the invention will be described in such environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, there is illustrated a rotating machine of the present invention, the rotating machine being referred to generally by reference numeral <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. The rotating machine <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> generally has a housing <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> encasing therein a rotor assembly <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> and a stator assembly <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. The rotating machine has a feed-through side <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> and a gear-box side <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the stator assembly <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> comprises a stator <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. The stator <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> has a plurality of field winding slots <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> for housing at least one electromagnetic conductor <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, a loop of which is referred to as a field winding <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Motors with large high frequency components of currents due primarily to the high frequency pulse width modulation of the drive inverter have been wound with a multi-strand jacketed wire, referred to in the art and alternatively herein as litz wire or litz-type wire, to reduce AC losses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, there is shown a cross-sectional view of a litz wire conductor <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. Litz wire is made by weaving many insulated smaller wires <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> in a pattern such that no single wire <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> occupies the perimeter exclusively. Typically the conductive wires <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> are wound within an outer jacket <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> in a helical pattern to form helical shaped longitudinal passages <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> between the individual wires <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>. This effectively eliminates skin effect in the litz wire conductor <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. One of the trade-offs in using litz wire is that the cross-section of copper is inherently reduced. The multiple small wires <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> cannot be packed with 100% fill factor, therefore a significant amount of space remains between the individual wires <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> of the litz wire conductor <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The rotating machine <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> of the present invention takes advantage of these longitudinal passages <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> by introducing a heat transfer fluid into them. Thus, the conductors for the stator <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> are made from a litz, or litz type wire, consisting of multiple smaller circular cross-section wires <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> bundled together. The bundle of wires <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> is then further insulated with one or more films that produce an outer jacket <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> over the wire bundle as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Litz wire of this type of construction is readily available from multiple sources. The outer film jacket <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is added for insulation value and mechanical protection and is preferably flexible such that the litz wire <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> can be wound within the stator slots <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. The outer jacket <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>, besides providing electrical insulation and mechanical protection, provides a flexible tubing for containment of the heat transfer fluid. The stator <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> is wound in a conventional fashion with the litz wire <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> having the outer jacket <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>. Slot liners (see reference numeral <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) are then unnecessary due to the additional insulating properties of the outer jacket <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> on the litz wire <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. This reduces motor winding costs and allows for more copper (i.e., conductor) to be put in each slot <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> After winding the stator <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> with the litz wire <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, the slots <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> are filled with an inpregnant, in a conventional manner, to restrain the wire from moving and to improve heat transfer. First and second plenums <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> or manifolds are formed at each end of the stator by rings (not shown) that isolate each stator end from the rotor cavity. The outside of each plenum <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> is formed by the stator housing <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and the end rings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows the coolant flow through the stator <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. Coolant, such as oils known to those skilled in the art, enter the rotating machine <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> into the first plenum <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> at the gearbox side <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> and exit the rotating machine <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> from the second plenum <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> on the feed-through side <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. The flow of coolant from the first plenum <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> at one end <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> of the rotating machine <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> to the second plenum <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> at the other end <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> of the rotating machine <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is through the longitudinal passages <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> in the litz wire <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). As discussed previously, the coolant is prevented from penetrating the slot <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> directly by a inpregnant that fills the voids between the wire <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> and the stator laminations. This prevents coolant from getting into the gap between the rotor <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> and the stator <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> and producing high viscous losses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The coolant is allowed to penetrate and exit the longitudinal passages <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> inside the litz wire <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> by violating the integrity of the outer jacket <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> in a manner that will not compromise the electrical characteristics in the area of the first and second plenums <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>. Referring back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the coolant is preferably introduced into the longitudinal passages <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> in the litz wire <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> by at least one entry hole <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> in the outer jacket <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> which provides fluid communication between the longitudinal passages <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and the first plenum <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>. Preferably, entry holes <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> are located about the circumference of the outer jacket <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> such that coolant is ensured of penetrating all of the longitudinal passages <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The entry hole <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> is preferably located on the loop portion <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> of each field winding <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> corresponding to the first plenum <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>. After traveling from the first plenum <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> and through the longitudinal passages <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> in the litz wire <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, the coolant preferably exits into the second plenum <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> from the longitudinal passages <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> through an exit hole in the outer jacket <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>. The exit hole is similar to the entry hole shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> but is preferably located on a loop portion <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> of each field winding corresponding to the second plenum <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>. Thus, the exit hole in the outer jacket <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> provides fluid communication between the longitudinal passages <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and the second plenum <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> by which the coolant leaves the longitudinal passages <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> through the exit hole and enters into the second plenum <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>. As with the entry holes <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight>, a plurality of exit holes located about the circumference of the outer jacket <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is preferred. Of course, those skilled in the art will recognize that the coolant flow can also be from the second plenum to the first plenum without departing from the scope or spirit of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Referring back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the rotating machine <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> of the present invention also has a circulation means for re-circulation of the coolant from the second plenum <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> into the first plenum <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> through an external conduit <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> which connects the first and second plenums <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>. The circulation means preferably comprises a pump <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> disposed in the external conduit <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> between the first and second plenums <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>. A heat exchanger <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> is also preferably disposed in the external conduit <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> between the first and second plenums <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> for removing heat from the coolant re-circulated therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Those skilled in the art will recognize that the improved rotating machine of the present invention provides direct contact between the litz wire and the heat transfer fluid to achieve efficient heat transfer and allows for an extremely compact design that has high reliability due to low AC losses and low operating temperatures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> While there has been shown and described what is considered to be preferred embodiments of the invention, it will, of course, be understood that various modifications and changes in form or detail could readily be made without departing from the spirit of the invention. It is therefore intended that the invention be not limited to the exact forms described and illustrated, but should be constructed to cover all modifications that may fall within the scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
