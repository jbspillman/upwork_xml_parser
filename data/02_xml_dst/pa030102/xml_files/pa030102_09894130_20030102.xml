<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> In the recent years, due to the continuous improvement of the electronic technology, the capability of the notebook computer and its peripheral products have been enhanced unceasingly. Various new kinds of peripheral products have substituted the old ones and the prices are even lower than before, that makes the notebook computer and its peripheral products become more available in our daily work, study and life, therefore people&apos;s request for the notebook computer grows rapidly. Facing such a wide and rising consuming market, all the major manufactures of notebook computers and its peripheral products are making their full effort to strive. Therefore, in this market full of challenges and competitions, every major manufacturer pre-installs various kinds of chips of peripheral products, wherein the familiar sound card and the modem are the most popular ones, on the mother board in the notebook computer to stimulate the consumers to choose the computer and its peripheral product made by the manufacturer in order to make own products attract a wide range of consumer groups so as to occupy more market niches. Consequently, usually several chips of different functions are already installed on the mother board in a newly purchased notebook computer to satisfy the basic need of the general consumers and to provide the computer manufacturer with an advantageous condition for opening up more business opportunities in the market. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the developmental trend of the notebook computer is to make thin, short and small size for convenient carry. All the major manufacturers continuously research, develop and attempt to reduce the weight and the thickness of the notebook computer. Wherein most of the general methods for reducing the weight of the notebook computer adapt the ways of changing the material of all the components, more especially, the housing body of the notebook computer is made of lighter alloy; the ways of reducing the thickness of the notebook computer art to try the best to integrate various components to be used on the same chip and to install it on the mother board in the notebook computer, thereby to tremendously reduce the thickness of the notebook computer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> However, the new peripheral products of the notebook computer keep coming out and the number of different chips and related components has been increased on the mother board in the notebook computer for satisfying the consumer&apos;s needs. That gradually results in insufficiently useable space on the circuit board and incapability of increasing new chips and related components. It is necessary to increase the length and width of the mother board for increasing the space on the mother board for installing the new chips and related components. It is against the original purpose of trending toward the thin, short and small size as well as convenient carry. Furthermore, since there are too many components installed on the mother board, when one of the components breaks down, the inspection and testing fee for the mother board is relative high and when situation like this happens, usually the whole notebook computer unit has to be sent for maintenance and that might cause trouble and a lot of inconvenience in use. </paragraph>
