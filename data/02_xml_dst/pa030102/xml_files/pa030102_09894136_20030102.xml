<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A system for carrying two channels of data over a single physical connection. In multi-node systems, data packets are divided into flits with flits from two channels being interleaved and carried by a single physical connection. Once the flits are transmitted, they are reassembled into packets in order to be carried by a processor bus. Controllers for the channel communicate to minimize &ldquo;bubbles&rdquo; observed during packet assembly by the processor bus. Thus, the data is transferred in two different types of resource sharing paradigms. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to the sharing of channels in a data network and more particularly to the sharing of channels by interleaving in a multi-node network system. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In various kinds of communication systems, it has always been the aim to fully utilize the capabilities of every connection in order to increase the amount of information that can be carried without additional increase in equipment. Thus, even in analog systems, such as telephones, the multiplexing concept was developed so that multiple analog signals could be placed onto a single wire. By doing this, more than one telephone connection or other information connection could be made at the same time. While this is especially used in wired connections, the same technique applies to other types of connections such as radio links, optical links, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In high speed digital equipment, the same goals remain. Especially in high speed processors and other computer components, it is desirable to completely utilize bandwidth while decreasing any latency in the data stream. Of particular interest are new multi-node systems which utilize a series of processors or nodes which generate or receive data and are connected through a network of interconnects. These interconnects may be routers, repeaters or switches and are used to transmit data from one node to the other. Examples of such multi-node systems include the Next Generation I/O (NGIO) system of Intel and the InfiniBand&trade; system. Such systems often use a virtual interface architecture to support data transfer between two memory regions, typically on different systems over one or more channels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In systems of this type the data is typically carried in units called packets which are transferred between nodes. However, packets can also be divided into smaller units called flits (flow interface transfer units). Packets are sent among various channels. Among some channels such as processor buses, the packets are the smallest units which can be present. Among other channels of a more local nature, it is possible to transfer individual flits along the channels. However, it has been difficult to arrange data in such a fashion that it can be transferred easily from one resource sharing paradigm to another, that is between rules governing local channels as opposed to the rules governing the processor bus, without problems of wasted bandwidth or extra latency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Attempts have been made to move more than a single data channel through an individual physical connection. A physical connection is typically a wire connection, but is also equally applicable to a radio link, optical link or other data connection. The concept of using a single connection for more than one channel is a well known concept and has been used for years in telephones and other analog systems where it is known as multiplexing. However, in digital systems this full use of resources is even more important in order to increase the speed of the device. Accordingly, it is important to fully utilize existing bandwidth and to avoid any increase in latency of the data.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Before beginning a detailed description of the subject invention, mention of the following is in order. When appropriate, like reference numerals and characters may be used to designate identical, corresponding or similar components in differing figure drawings. Further, in the detailed description to follow, example sizes/models/values/ranges may be given, although the present invention is not limited to the same. Still further, the clock and timing signal FIGS. are not drawn to scale, and instead, exemplary and critical time values are mentioned when appropriate. With regard to description of any timing signals, the terms assertion and negation may be used in an intended generic sense. More particularly, such terms are used to avoid confusion when working with a mixture of &ldquo;active-low&rdquo; and &ldquo;active-high&rdquo; signals, and to represent the fact that the invention is not limited to the illustrated/described signals, but could be implemented with a total/partial reversal of any of the &ldquo;active-low&rdquo; and &ldquo;active-high&rdquo; signals by a simple change in logic. More specifically, the terms &ldquo;assert&rdquo; or &ldquo;assertion&rdquo; indicate that a signal is active independent of whether that level is represented by a high or low voltage, while the terms &ldquo;negate&rdquo; or &ldquo;negation&rdquo; indicate that a signal is inactive. As a final note, well known power/ground connections to ICs and other components may not be shown within the FIGS. for simplicity of illustration and discussion, and so as not to obscure the invention. Further, arrangements may be shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring the invention, and also in view of the fact that specifics with respect to implementation of such block diagram arrangements are highly dependent upon the platform within which the present invention is to be implemented, i.e., such specifics should be well within purview of one skilled in the art. Where specific details (e.g., circuits, flowcharts) are set forth in order to describe example embodiments of the invention, it should be apparent to one skilled in the art that the invention can be practiced without, or with variation of, these specific details. Finally, it should be apparent that differing combinations of hard-wired circuitry and software instructions can be used to implement embodiments of the present invention, i.e., the present invention is not limited to any specific combination of hardware and software. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The present invention is applicable for use with all types of data networks, I/O hardware adapters and chipsets, including follow-on chip designs which link together end stations such as computers, servers, peripherals, storage subsystems, and communication devices for data communications. Examples of such data networks may include a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), a campus area network (CAN), a metropolitan area network (MAN), a global area network (GAN), a wireless personal area network (WPAN), and a system area network (SAN), including newly developed computer networks using Next Generation I/O (NGIO), Future I/O (FIO), InifiBand&trade; and those networks including channel-based, switched fabric architectures which may become available as computer technology advances to provide scalable performance. LAN systems may include Ethernet, FDDI (Fiber Distributed Data Interface), Token Ring LAN, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) LAN, Fiber Channel, and Wireless LAN. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Attention is now directed to the drawings and particularly to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> in which a data network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is shown including a processor bus <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The bus is connected to node <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. This node is also connected to an additional node <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> by way of two physical connections <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Node <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> includes at least four channels indicated as <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Node <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> includes channels <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. In addition node <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> includes two queues <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> As seen, each physical connection <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> connects two channels in adjoining nodes. It is possible to utilize a single physical connection to connect two channels by alternating or interleaving units of data such as packets or flits from the two channels. In some cases, the channels then are called virtual channels because they do not have a separate physical connection but share the connection. The physical connection can be shared on a flit-by-flit basis when desired, or packet-by-packet when possible. When the individual flits are received, they are reassembled into a single packet and stored in queue <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Since the processor bus can only handle data in complete packets, it is necessary for the flits to be reassembled into a packet before being transferred onto the bus. Thus, it is said that the bus <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the physical connections <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> have different resource sharing paradigms, because data my move in flits or packets in connections <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, but only in packets in BUS <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> While it is possible to merely follow a simple arbitration scheme to alternate the flits, &ldquo;bubbles&rdquo; often occur in the destination node. Bubbles are caused by the interleaving of flits from the channels as they are transferred across a physical connection. The interleaving causes the receiving interface to pause by one or more flits as it accumulates the flits of a particular channel. Unfortunately, the presence of such bubbles wastes critical bandwidth in what is considered to be a highly utilized resource. The receiver must waste the bandwidth or must buffer the packet to eliminate the bubbles before sending it onto the bus, which increases latency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The present invention further improves on this system by including controllers <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> which are connected to channels <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, respectively. Similar controllers are also provided for the two channels <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Each of the controllers is in communication with another controller corresponding to the channel which shares the physical connection with its own channel. Thus, controllers <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are in communication and controllers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> are in communication. While neither of the controllers of a pair is actually in charge, information is transferred back and forth to let each other know whether flits are available for a transfer and whether the other end of the channel is able to receive more flits. By keeping each other apprized of its own situation, the controllers are able to alternate sending flits as long as certain situations do not occur. For example, if the flit being sent is the end of a packet, it is important to let the other channel controller know so that if a new packet does not arrive immediately, the other side can continue to send flits. Similarly, if there is no valid data in the channel to be transferred, the other channel controller is notified so that the other channel may utilize the connection completely. Another possible situation is if back pressure is received from the receiving end of the channel, that is, the receiver is full and cannot accept more data. Controllers at opposite ends of a channel are in communication also. That is, if controller <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> receives information from controller <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> that channel <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> cannot accept more flits from channel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, controller <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> informs controller <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the situation so that channel <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can fully utilize the physical connection by itself. The indication of backpressure can also be implemented in other manners. By utilizing this arbitration scheme, all of the characteristics of the strict alternation of flits are achieved. However, this scheme optimizes the transfer of an individual packet which allows the receiving channel to place the packet into the queue as soon as the packet flits are received without wasting bandwidth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Each channel in the figure contains small transverse lines which indicate the individual flits that are stored therein. Each channel is some form of storage device such as a queue or register. In each pair of channels shown, one channel is dedicated to requests and the other to responses. However, any two channels can be utilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> While the figure shows a particular arrangement of channels for transferring data between nodes, this system can also be used in any situation where two channels need to share a physical connection. It is only required that the controllers for the channels can interact and utilize the same arbitration scheme. Thus, the system can be used in any type of digital data transfer system where wasted band width is a problem. Also, it is possible to use the system where more than two channels are involved, as long as all channels are aware of the other channels situation and all utilize the same arbitration scheme to decide who can send in the following flit. This system has been shown as having controllers which cooperate but with neither controller actually in charge. It would also be possible to utilize a scheme where one channel is in charge and controls the other, based on information from both channels. However, the system is most effectively used where data is being transferred from one type of resource sharing paradigm to another, such as where the flit-interleaving system is in communication with a packet-only processor bus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a flow chart which may be utilized as the arbitration scheme by the controller. Other schemes could also be used long as they take account of the movement of data in both channels and prevent the formation of bubbles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> It is assumed that two controllers are connected to a single channel. The flow chart indicates whether the first (I or me) sends data or whether the second (other) sends data. At the beginning step <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the first controller determines whether it has data to send. If it does not, it then merely loops back and repeats this question until it has data to send. When it does have data to send, it then determines whether the other controller has data to send in step <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. If the other controller has no data, the first controller proceeds to send data by itself in step <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. However, if the other controller also has data, a procedure must be implemented in order to determine who sends next. This starts in step <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> where it is determined if the first controller was the last one to send data. If it was the last to send, it then determines whether it is starting to send a new packet or not in step <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. If it is not sending a new packet then the second controller sends data as indicated in step <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Thus, in this situation, the two controllers alternate data. If the second controller was the last one to send data so that the answer to step <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is no, step <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> then determines whether the second controller has a new packet. If not, the procedure returns to the top. However, if the other controller has a new packet, the other controller sends data in step <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Other arbitration schemes are possible. If more than two channels are using the same physical connection, the scheme must be enlarged to take account of all of the other channels. Also, if the controllers are set up so that one controller acts as a master, the scheme must be adjusted so that the master receives all of the information and makes all the decisions and merely sends an enabling signal to the other controllers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In concluding, reference in the specification to &ldquo;one embodiment&rdquo;, &ldquo;an embodiment&rdquo;, &ldquo;example embodiment&rdquo;, etc., means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the invention. The appearances of such phrases in various places in the specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. Further, when a particular feature, structure, or characteristic is described in connection with any embodiment, it is submitted that it is within the purview of one skilled in the art to effect such feature, structure, or characteristic in connection with other ones of the embodiments. Furthermore, for ease of understanding, certain method procedures may have been delineated as separate procedures; however, these separately delineated procedures should not be construed as necessarily order dependent in their performance, i.e., some procedures may be able to be performed in an alternative ordering, simultaneously, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> This concludes the description of the example embodiments. Although the present invention has been described with reference to a number of illustrative embodiments thereof, it should be understood that numerous other modifications and embodiments can be devised by those skilled in the art that will fall within the spirit and scope of the principles of this invention. More particularly, reasonable variations and modifications are possible in the component parts and/or arrangements of the subject combination arrangement within the scope of the foregoing disclosure, the drawings and the appended claims without departing from the spirit of the invention.
