<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to window framing systems which use corner keys, particularly for use in garage doors. The corner keys are insertable into hollow portions of extruded window frames and which preliminarily hold the window frame together prior to more permanent fastening within a garage door by a plurality of screws. The angularity of at least two internal ribs of the corner key into which a fastener impinges thereupon, facilitates tightening engagement of each mitered window frame corner, leading to a superior appearance and preventing moisture from getting inside the window unit. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Consumers often request the inclusion of a series of decorative windows in garage doors. These windows are usually incorporated into the upper section of the garage door. The windows are formed in individual panels of the upper section and provide daylight illumination of the closed garage. A window opening is generally cut or preformed in each panel into which a window is to be inserted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In the past, a rather cumbersome window and window framework system was inserted into the opening. Improvements to this base system included using a corner key to facilitate holding the mitered frame together, followed by insertion into the window opening and ultimate fastening to the garage door using screws. This process, while partially effective did suffer from some drawbacks. First, while the insertion of a corner key into hollow voids contained within the extruded plastic frames did initially hold the mitered window frame together thereby facilitating initial insertion of the frame into the opening, subsequent screwing of the frame into the garage door resulted in the creation of a gap between the mitered edges of the window frame as the frame was drawn close to the planar surface of the garage door. This gap leads to both an inferior exterior appearance as well as permitting rain or other external moisture to seep through the gaps created in the corners and migrate downwardly through the garage door panels, leading to internal rusting of the door and often through repeated exposure to moisture, unsightly water trails containing rust particles on both the exterior and interior garage door panels. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a corner key fastener for use in a decorative window system for a window opening in a garage door wherein the installation of the decorative window framing system is achieved by the use of these corner keys inserted into hollow extruded plastic window frame with subsequent attachment into the garage door by screws. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is an object of this invention to provide improvements in the area of the installation of garage door window systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is another object of this invention to provide improvements in the formation of the decorative window systems by achieving a secure and tight framing system by imparting at least a non-transverse vector force component to the window frame by the deployment of at least a pair of angled ribs within the corner key. The use of these corner key fasteners in a window framing system achieves a more secure and tighter seal at the miter joint of the frame, thus preventing moisture, water, or other natural elements from entering the hollow interior of the garage door. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> These and other objects of this invention will be evident when viewed in light of the drawings, detailed description and the pending claims.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the drawings wherein the showing is for the purpose of illustrating the preferred embodiment of the invention only and not for purposes of limiting the same, the figures show a corner key which connects the framing system without resort to the installation methods involving either physical pounding or the use of machine screws with nuts alone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> 90&deg; corner key device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is shown having two perpendicularly extending legs <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> joined at a common vertex <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and two ends <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. One leg of the corner key device will be at least partially inserted into mating engagement with a first receiving longitudinal hollow void of an extruded plastic profile, while the other leg is at least partially inserted into mating engagement with a second receiving hollow void of an extruded plastic profile. While the device typically has a plane of symmetry, typically a mirror image opposed side, there is no requirement to limit to such, and the invention is applicable to situations where the legs have different geometries, physical dimensions and links. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> While the key corner device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> has a 90&deg; bend, it is recognized that this is due to the fact that the typical garage door window has four sides, thereby necessitating this angle. For other window configurations, the angle of the key corner device is a matter of common knowledge of trigonometry. While the length of the two legs of the corner device as shown in the figure are equal, there is no need to limit the invention to such, and it is possible for either leg of the device to extend into the longitudinal receiving void to varying degrees, depending on the application requirements for corner rigidity and dimensional stability. The device will penetrate at least part way longitudinally and into the hollow voids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Each leg of the key will have an interior <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and exterior <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> wall with contiguous floor thereby creating a channel profile. In one embodiment, the interior and exterior walls will have a slight taper <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> at both peripheral ends <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the key device. This tapered arrangement facilitates insertion of each leg of the device into the mating hollow voids of the extruded frame. The floor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of each leg <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has at least one aperture <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> disposed therein, typically positioned toward a peripheral end <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the key device. Each leg of the device additionally has at least one inwardly angled rib <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> positioned so as to intersect a vertical axis of the at least one aperture. The angle of the inwardly angled ribs <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> must be less than 90&deg;, preferably from approximately 10&deg; and 80&deg; inclusive, more preferably from approximately 30&deg; and 80&deg; inclusive, and most preferably from 45&deg; and 70&deg; inclusive. Depending on the degree of stiffness required of the corner key, the inwardly angled ribs may be in connected relationship with an interior wall <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> along the entire length of the rib or only in connected relationship with a portion <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the length of the rib. As illustrated with inwardly angled rib <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, if the strength of the rib is sufficient, there may be no contact with either interior wall <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> along a length of the rib. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Insertion of a fastening device, e.g., screw <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, through an exterior mitered frame of the framing system generates an axial downward force F<highlight><subscript>y </subscript></highlight>(i.e., Y-direction) as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 &amp; 4</cross-reference>, permitting axial movement through an opening <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> in the window system and in colinear alignment with an aperture e.g., <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the key device. With further penetration of the fastening device into a channel <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the device, impinging contact is made with inwardly angled rib <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> which imparts a lateral deflecting force vector having at least a component normal to penetrating axial movement (F<highlight><subscript>z </subscript></highlight>or z-direction as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> for window framing member <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and F<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>or x-direction as illustrated for window framing member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>). As the fastening device continues to migrate upwardly on the angled rib or ramp, additional vector forces normal to the axis of penetration are created which force the window frame to force the window frame in the direction of its opposed mitered corner end (not shown). Each ramp does the same behavior with the result being that each mitered corner is in tight communication resulting in an aesthetically pleasing visual appearance lacking in mitered corner gaps <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Discussion </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Thus, what has been described is both a window framing corner key and a window framing system utilizing the same, particularly suitable for use in garage door applications, although the application is not limited to such, but rather encompasses any situation wherein a window with associated frame needs to be assembled on-site and with minimal assistance. One of the aspects of the invention is the capitalization on an inwardly facing angled rib within a channel of the key device. As a fastening means, e.g., screw is pushed axially through a hole in a mitered window frame, and through an aperture in colinear alignment with the mitered window frame hole, a biasing force is generated normal to the axis of the fastening device which forces the window frame in tight physical alignment with the mitered corners, thereby promoting an aesthetically pleasing appearance with minimal opportunity for exterior weather elements to penetrate inside the door. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> This invention has been described in detail with reference to specific embodiments thereof, including the respective best modes for carrying out each embodiment. It shall be understood that these illustrations are by way of example and not by way of limitation. </paragraph>
