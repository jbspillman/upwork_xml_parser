<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">An input circuit that receives an input signal and generates an output signal as a function of the input signal includes a latching circuit and a time blanking circuit. The latching circuit detects a transition of the input signal and causes a corresponding transition of the output signal. The time blanking circuit prevents the output signal from transitioning again for a predetermined period. This period begins with essentially no delay from the transition of the output signal, which can reduce the input circuit&apos;s sensitivity to high frequency noise that may be present on transitions of the input signal. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A typical integrated circuit includes input circuits to receive signals from other parts of the integrated circuit and output them with &ldquo;restored&rdquo; voltage levels and appropriate driving current for circuitry receiving the output signal of the input circuit. As is well known, a variety of sources may inject noise into the signal received by the input circuit. For example, sources include ringing caused by mismatched output drivers or interconnect impedance, signal cross-coupling, and power supply noise. This noise can cause an input circuit to improperly output the received signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> One conventional solution to this noise problem is to design the input circuits with hysteresis (e.g., having a trip point for low-to-high transition that is higher than the trip point for a high-to-low transition of the input signal). However, this solution is ineffective against noise that causes the signal to exceed one of the trip points. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of a circuit and method for receiving an input signal and generating a corresponding output signal are described herein. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth (such as, for example, the components/functional units of a microprocessor) to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments of the invention. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize, however, that the invention can be practiced without one or more of the specific details, or with other methods, components, materials, etc. In other instances, well-known structures, materials, or operations are not shown or described in detail to avoid obscuring aspects of the invention. </paragraph>

Main memory <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may also be used for storing temporary variables or other intermediate information during execution of instructions by processor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. ROM <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, for storing static information and instructions for processor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, is coupled to processor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> via bus <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Input devices <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, such as a keyboard or mouse, are coupled to processor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> through bus <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Output devices <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are also coupled to processor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> via bus <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Typical output devices <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> include printers and display monitors. Storage devices <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> are also coupled to processor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> via bus <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>.

By way of example, computer system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may include video memory, cache memory, as well as other dedicated memory, and additional signal lines and busses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates an embodiment of processor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), which is coupled to external clock source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a supply voltage source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. This embodiment of processor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> includes an instruction decoder unit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, an execution unit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, internal clock circuitry <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, register file unit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, address translation unit <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and bus interface unit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, input circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is part of internal clock circuitry <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, supply voltage source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and external clock source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> respectively provide a supply voltage VCC and a system clock SCLK to processor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The embodiment of processor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> presented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is illustrative. In light of this disclosure, those of ordinary skill in the art will understand that, in practice, a modern processor is generally more complex and may include additional components, such as internal cache, which have been omitted for ease of understanding. To improve clarity, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> does not show internal buses and other communication paths that electrically interconnect internal clock circuitry <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and various functional units of processor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (e.g., instruction decode unit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, execution unit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, register file unit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, address translation unit <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, and bus interface unit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>). In addition, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> does not show other input circuits substantially similar to input circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> that may be used to receive other signals. Accordingly, processor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is presented without limitation, and the present invention is generally applicable to all types of processors (e.g., microprocessors, microcontrollers, digital signal processors, etc.), irrespective of the specific architecture employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The bus interface unit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is coupled to bus <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, as well as main memory <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and ROM <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Bus interface unit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> facilitates transmission of data between main memory <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and processor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and performs fetching of instructions and other data from ROM <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Address translation unit <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> performs memory management for processor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Specifically, address translation unit stores the memory addresses&mdash;whether in main memory <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, internal cache, or other memory&mdash;of data being used by the processor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> during operation. Instruction decoder unit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> decodes instructions and other control signals received by processor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Execution unit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is intended to present a broad category of microprocessor functional units providing a wide range of functions. By way of example, execution unit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may comprise an arithmetic and logic unit for performing arithmetic operations, including shifts, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Register file unit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may comprise one or more types of registers for storing data being used by processor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. For example, register file unit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may include integer registers, status registers, instruction pointer registers, and floating point registers, as well as others. If present, the internal cache (not shown) may be used, for example, to store data and control signals from main memory <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> External clock source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> provides a clock signal having an external clock frequency to internal clock circuitry <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> via input circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (described in more detail below). Internal clock circuitry <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, which may comprise a phase lock loop (PLL) circuit, adjusts the external clock frequency&mdash;either increasing or decreasing this frequency&mdash;to achieve a desired operating frequency for processor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates input circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>), according to one embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, input circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> includes a latching circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and a time blanking circuit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> coupled to latching circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Referring to both <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and the flow diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, input circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> operates as follows. Input circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> receives an input signal IN via a line <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and generates an output signal OUT as a function of the input signal via a line <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. In particular, latching circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is connected to line <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to receive input signal IN. Latching circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, in effect, monitors input signal IN for a transition of its logic level (e.g., a low-to-high or a high-to-low logic level transition). This operational is illustrated as steps <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Latching circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> continues to monitor input signal IN without changing the logic level of output signal OUT while the logic level of input signal IN is unchanged. This operation is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> by the looping back to step <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> from step <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> if no transition is detected in step <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> If input signal IN transitions to a different logic level, latching circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> causes a corresponding transition of output signal OUT at line <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. This operation is illustrated as a step <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. For example, in one embodiment latching circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> generates output signal OUT with the opposite logic level as input signal IN. In other embodiments, latching circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can generate output signal OUT with the same logic level as input signal IN. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In response to the transition of output signal OUT, time blanking circuit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, in conjunction with latching circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, prevents output signal OUT from transitioning again for a predetermined period. In accordance with the present invention, this predetermined period begins with essentially no delay from the transition of output signal OUT. This operation is illustrated as a step <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. This aspect advantageously reduces the sensitivity of input circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to high frequency noise that may be present on transitions of input signal IN. At the end of the predetermined period, input circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is free to transition output signal OUT in response to the logic level of input signal IN. This operation is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> by the looping back to step <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> from step <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates an implementation of input circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>), according to one embodiment of the present invention. This embodiment includes RS latches <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, a two-input multiplexer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and a delay circuit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, RS latches <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, in conjunction with multiplexer <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> serve as latching circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). Further, delay circuit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> in conjunction with multiplexer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> serve as time blanking circuit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). Delay circuit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is used in defining the time blanking period that begins with each transition of output signal OUT, as described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The elements of this embodiment of input circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are interconnected as follows. RS latch <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is connected to receive input signal IN at its S terminal via line <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The inverted output terminal of RS latch <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is connected to one of the input terminals of multiplexer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> via a line <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. RS latch <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> has a complemented S terminal that is connected to receive the input signal IN. The non-inverted output terminal of RS latch <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is connected to the other input terminal of multiplexer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> via a line <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. The output terminal of multiplexer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is connected to output line <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and to the input lead of delay circuit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. Delay circuit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> has an output lead <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> connected to the control terminal of multiplexer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, a complemented R terminal of RS latch <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and to the R terminal of RS latch <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. The operation of the embodiment of input circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is described below in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Although <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates a particular implementation of input circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, in this embodiment of the present invention, the RS latches are configured so that when one RS latch receives signals at its R and S terminals that cause the RS latch to perform a &ldquo;set&rdquo; operation, the other RS latch receives these same signals but performs a &ldquo;reset&rdquo; operation. For example, in this embodiment, one RS latch receives input signal IN at its S terminal, while the other RS latch receives, in effect, the complement of input signal IN at its S terminal. Similarly, one RS latch receives output signal OUT (via delay circuit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>) at its S terminal, while the other RS latch in effect receives the complement of output signal OUT at its R terminal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In addition, the inverted output terminal of one RS latch (i.e., Qbar) and the non-inverted output terminal (i.e., Q) of the other RS latch are used by input circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> so that, in effect, both RS latches generate the same output signal in response to the same input signals. For example, when the RS latch with the non-inverted output signal performs a set operation (i.e., Q&equals;1), the other RS latch performs a reset operation (Q&equals;0), but input circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> uses the inverted output signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Still further, according to this embodiment of the present invention, in the steady state, the RS latches are configured so that one RS latch, in effect, will be in the &ldquo;unchanged&rdquo; state (R&equals;S&equals;0) and the other RS latch, in effect will be in the &ldquo;don&apos;t care&rdquo; state (R&equals;S&equals;1). In the steady state, multiplexer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is configured to select the output signal from the RS latch in the &ldquo;unchanged&rdquo; state. As a result of this configuration, a transition occurring in input signal IN causes the selected RS latch to perform a set operation and the other RS latch to perform a reset operation (but providing an equivalent output signal because its output signal is inverted relative to the other RS latch). In addition, this transition also starts the time blanking period. Thus, a glitch on input signal IN during the time blanking period can only cause the selected RS latch to enter the unchanged state, thereby leaving the selected output signal unchanged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> At the end of the time blanking period, multiplexer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> receives a signal that causes multiplexer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to transition it logic level, which causes multiplexer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to select the output signal from the other RS latch (i.e., the reset RS latch). In this embodiment, this signal is signal DELAY_OUT, which is a delayed version of output signal OUT provided by delay circuit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. This signal (or, in effect, its complement) is also provided to both RS latches at their R terminals. Thus, the transition of the signal causes the RS latch in the set state to transition to the &ldquo;don&apos;t care&rdquo; state and the RS latch in the reset state to transition to the unchanged state. Accordingly, in the steady state, the selected RS latch in the unchanged state and ready to enter the set state in response to the next transition of input signal IN. This operation is described below in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates the timing of input circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) in operation during a low-to-high transition of input signal IN and then returning to a logic low level. In particular, a waveform <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> illustrates input signal IN. A waveform <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> illustrates the inverted output signal from RS latch <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. A waveform <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> illustrates the non-inverted output signal from RS latch <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. A waveform <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> illustrates output signal OUT, and a waveform <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> illustrates the output signal from delay circuit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>, this embodiment of input circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> operates as follows. This description starts with input circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> being in an initial state with: (a) input signal IN at a logic low level; (b) the inverted output signal of RS latch <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> at a logic high level; (c) the non-inverted output signal from RS latch <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> at a logic high level; (d) output signal OUT at a logic high level; and (e) the output signal of delay circuit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> (i.e., signal DELAY_OUT) at a logic high level. As a result, RS latch <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, in effect, receives logic low levels at its R and S terminals, which put RS latch <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in the unchanged state, outputting a logic high level signal. The logic high level of signal DELAY_OUT causes multiplexer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to select the inverted output signal of RS latch <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to serve as output signal OUT. RS latch <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, in effect, receives logic high levels at its R terminal and its S terminal (i.e., the don&apos;t care state), but its output signal is not selected by multiplexer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> When input signal IN transitions to a logic high level as indicated by an edge <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>A of waveform <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, RS latch <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, in effect, receives a logic low reset signal and a logic high set signal, thereby causing its inverted output signal to transition to a logic low level, as indicated by edge <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>A. In addition, RS latch <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, in effect, receives a logic high reset signal and a logic low set signal, thereby causing its non-inverted output signal to transition to a logic low level as indicated by an edge <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>A of waveform <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. Because multiplexer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> selects the inverted output signal of RS latch <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, edge <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>A also results in output signal OUT transitioning to a logic low level, as indicated by an edge <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>A of waveform <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In this example, input signal IN experiences noise relatively quickly after edge <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>A. This noise causes a falling edge quickly followed by a rising edge in waveform <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, as indicated by an arrow <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. This noise occurs within the time blanking period defined by delay circuit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> (i.e., the period starting from the transition of the output signal of RS latch <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to when the transition propagates through delay circuit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>). Because the R terminal of RS latch <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, in effect, receives a logic low level (because the logic low level of output signal OUT is delayed be delay circuit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>), the noise on input signal IN puts RS latch <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in the &ldquo;unchanged&rdquo; state (i.e., R&equals;S&equals;0), resulting in no change in output signal OUT. On the other hand, the noise on input signal IN can cause transitions in the output signal of RS latch <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. However, because multiplexer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> selects the inverted output signal from RS latch <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> during the time blanking period, such transitions do not affect output signal OUT. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> At the end of the time blanking period (i.e., the delay provided by delay circuit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>), signal DELAY_OUT transitions to a logic low level, as indicated by an edge <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>A of waveform <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. Consequently, multiplexer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> selects the non-inverted output signal of RS latch <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. In addition, the logic low level of signal DELAY_OUT propagates to the complemented R terminal of RS latch <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> (and the R terminal of RS latch <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>), which, in effect, causes RS latch <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to receive a logic high reset signal. In this embodiment, RS latch <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> causes its inverted output signal to transition to a logic high level, as indicated by an edge <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>B of waveform <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. However, this transition does not affect output signal OUT because multiplexer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> has selected the non-inverted output signal of the RS latch <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. RS latch <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is in a &ldquo;don&apos;t care&rdquo; state because it receives, in effect, logic high R and S signals (which is not allowed in typical uses of RS latches), which is tolerated because multiplexer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> has selected the output signal of RS latch <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In the steady state after the time blanking period, RS latch <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, in effect, receives logic low level signals at its R and S terminals. Thus, RS latch <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is in the unchanged state, outputting a logic low level signal that is selected by multiplexer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to serve as output signal OUT. When input signal IN transitions to a logic low level signal, as indicated by an edge <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>B of waveform <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, RS latch <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> receives a logic high level signal at its S terminal, thereby causing RS latch <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> to transition its non-inverted output signal to a logic high level. Multiplexer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> propagates this transition as output signal OUT, as indicated by an edge <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>B of waveform <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> During the time blanking period initiated by the low-to-high transition of output signal OUT, multiplexer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> continues to select the non-inverted output signal of RS latch <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. Thus, noise (e.g., indicated by an arrow <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>) causing a transition of input signal IN during the time blanking period merely cause RS latch <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> to enter the unchanged state. Thus, such noise occurring during the time blanking period does not affect output signal OUT. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In addition, the high-to-low transition of input signal IN (e.g., edge <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>B) results in RS latch <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> receiving in effect a logic low level signal at its S terminal. Consequently, RS latch <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> enters the &ldquo;reset&rdquo; state. Thus, the inverted output signal of RS latch <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> remains at a logic high level. As a result, in this embodiment, noise occurring during the time banking period does not affect the inverted output signal of RS latch <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> At the end of the time blanking period, signal DELAY_OUT transitions to a logic high level, as indicated by an edge <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>B of waveform <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. This transition causes multiplexer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to select the inverted output signal from RS latch <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, which is outputting a logic high level. Thus, the logic level of output signal OUT is unchanged and RS latches <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> respectively receive, in effect, a logic low and a logic high signal at their R terminals. Thus, input circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is back in the initial state described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> schematically illustrates an implementation of RS latches <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>), according to one embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, RS latch <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> includes an inverter <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and two-input NAND gates <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. Inverter <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is connected to receive input signal IN via line <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, which serves as the S terminal for RS latch <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. NAND gates <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> are cross-coupled (i.e., each NAND gate having its output lead connected to one of the input leads of the other NAND gate). NAND gate <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> has its other input lead connected to the output lead of inverter <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The other input lead of NAND gate <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is connected to the output lead of delay circuit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> via line <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, which serves as the complemented R terminal for RS latch <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The output lead of NAND gate <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> serves as the inverted output terminal of RS latch <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Such an implementation is similar to a standard RS latch implementation having two inverters and two NAND gates (see e.g., &ldquo;Electronic Devices and Circuits: Discrete and Integrated&rdquo;, M. S. Ghausi, 1985, pages 638-639) except that the inverter corresponding to the complemented R input terminal of RS latch <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is omitted to achieve the complementing. Of course, in other embodiments, the standard NAND gate implementation of the RS latch with an additional inverter connected to the R input terminal. In light of the present disclosure, those skilled in the art can implement RS latch circuits suitable for use in input circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, without undue experimentation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Similarly, RS latch <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> includes an inverter <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and two-input NAND gates <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. Inverter <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is connected to receive signal DELAY_OUT from delay circuit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> via line <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. The input lead of inverter <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> serves as the R terminal for RS latch <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. NAND gates <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> are cross-coupled. NAND gate <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> has its other input lead connected to the output lead of inverter <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. NAND gate <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> has its other input lead connected to receive input signal IN via line <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, which serves as the complemented S terminal of RS latch <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. The output lead of NAND gate <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> serves as the non-inverting output terminal of RS latch <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. Such an implementation is also similar to a standard RS latch implementation having two inverters and two NAND gates, except that the inverter corresponding to the complemented S input terminal of RS latch <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is omitted to achieve the complementing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Multiplexer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> can be implemented in any suitable manner (e.g., using transmission gates). Delay circuit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> can also be implemented in any suitable manner (e.g., an even number of cascaded inverters). In one embodiment, delay circuit provides a delay of about five nanoseconds so that a transition of input signal IN, in effect, is sampled only once. In other embodiments, the delay can different but should be at least as long as the rise/fall time of the input signal, and can be as long as the shorter of the input signal&apos;s logic high or logic low time. </paragraph>

RS latch <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is implemented as described above in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>; however, in this embodiment, RS latch <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is implemented using NOR gates <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>. This implementation of RS latch <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is a standard NOR gate circuit (see e.g., &ldquo;Electronic Devices and Circuits: Discrete and Integrated&rdquo;, M. S.

In this embodiment, RS latch <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is implemented with P-channel transistor <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>P, N-channel transistor <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>N and inverters <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The elements of RS latch <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are interconnected as follows. P-channel transistor <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>P has its source, gate and drain respectively connected to the VCC bus, delay circuit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> via line <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, and the drain of N-channel transistor <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>N. The gate of P-channel transistor <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>P serves as the complemented R terminal for RS latch <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The source and gate of N-channel transistor <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>N are respectively connected to the ground bus and line <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> (to receive input signal IN). The gate of N-channel transistor <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>N serves as the S terminal of RS latch <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The drain of N-channel transistor <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>N is also connected to the output lead of inverter <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> and to the input leads of inverters <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight>. The output lead of inverter <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is connected to the input lead of inverter <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>. Inverters <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> form a standard latch. The output lead of inverter <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> is connected to the input lead of inverter <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, which outputs the Qbar signal of RS latch <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> onto line <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The elements of RS latch <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> are interconnected as follows. P-channel transistor <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>P has its source, gate and drain respectively connected to the VCC bus, line <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> (to receive input signal IN), and the drain of N-channel transistor <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>N. The gate of P-channel transistor <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> serves as the complemented S terminal for RS latch <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>.

The output lead of inverter <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> is connected to the input lead of inverter <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> RS latch <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> operates as follows. When R&equals;S&equals;0, transistors <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>P and <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>N are both turned off, thereby allows the latch formed by inverters <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> to maintain the current output signal. When R&equals;1 and S&equals;0 (i.e., reset), P-channel transistor <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>P is turned on (due to the complementing at the R terminal), while N-channel transistor <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>N is off . Thus, P-channel transistor <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>P pulls up the voltage at the input lead of inverter <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight>, which then outputs a logic low signal. Inverter <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> then outputs a logic high signal onto line <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, RS latch <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> outputs a logic high Qbar signal during the reset state. Conversely, when R&equals;0 and S&equals;1 (i.e., set), transistors <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>P and <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>N are turned off and on, respectively. Thus, N-channel transistor <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>N pulls down the voltage at the input lead of inverter <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight>, which then outputs a logic high signal. Inverter <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> then outputs a logic low level onto line <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>.

When R&equals;S&equals;1, transistors <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>P and <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>N are both turned on; however, since the output signal of RS latch <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is not used during this state, the ambiguity can be tolerated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> RS latch <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> operates as follows. When R&equals;S&equals;0, transistors <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>P and <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>N are both turned off, thereby allows the latch formed by inverters <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> to maintain the current output signal.

Thus, P-channel transistor <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>P pulls up the voltage at the input lead of inverter <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, which then outputs a logic low signal, which in turn is inverted by inverter <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, RS latch <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> outputs a logic high Q signal during the set state. Conversely, when R&equals;1 and S&equals;0 (i.e., reset), transistors <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>P and <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>N are turned off and on, respectively.
