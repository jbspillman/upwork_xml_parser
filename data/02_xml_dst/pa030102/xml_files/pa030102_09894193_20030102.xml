<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to the magnetic materials used in recording heads for disk and tape drives and more specifically to the reduction of magnetostriction in these materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Recording heads are widely used in disk drives and tape drives for storage and retrieval of digital information. Recording heads usually have separate write and read elements. Soft magnetic material having a low coercivity and a high saturated magnetic moment is used for the poles of the write element and the shields for the read element. In a tape drive the tape is in frequent contact with the recording head. Therefore, wear resistance is an important additional consideration in a tape drive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The shield layers and write head poles are in close proximity to the read sensor. Because of this proximity, it is important that the layers be magnetically stable. It is important for the performance of the drive that the soft magnetic material be relatively free of stress and magnetostriction because these effects can lead to magnetic instability. If the magnetic domains in the shields and poles move when subjected to extraneous fields such as fields from the write head or fields from the rotating magnetic disk (or more precisely, when the walls between different magnetic domains move, resulting in the growing or shrinking of domains), Barkhausen noise is generated and is sensed in the read element. This noise can seriously degrade the quality of the readback signal. Furthermore, when after movement the domains do not come back to their original position, the shield or pole exerts a field which is oriented differently on the sensor layer in the read element. This changes the magnetic bias on the read element leading to signal asymmetry and increased error rates. Finally, the magnetic permeability of the shields or pole layers can be reduced with this non-repeatable or hysteretic behavior of the domains and this also has a detrimental effect on the read element performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A common set of materials used in shields and poles are alloys of nickel and iron. For example Ni(80%)Fe(20%) has good magnetostriction but somewhat limited saturated moment (Ms&cong;10 kG). Increasing the Fe content increases the moment but leads to high magnetostriction. For example Ni(45%)Fe(55%) has better moment (Ms&cong;16 kG) but a rather high magnetostriction of about 25&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;6</superscript></highlight>. Attempts have been made in the past to laminate materials using alternate layers of materials having positive and negative magnetostriction. These films tend to have high local stress at the interfaces between layers. Another approach to develop a material with improved magnetic stability has lead to the development of alternate layers of magnetic and non-magnetic layers. The addition of a significant amount of non-magnetic material results in a significantly reduced moment for the overall laminate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A material is needed to construct recording heads which exhibits very low magnetostriction while not sacrificing the good magnetic properties of low coercivity and high magnetic moment. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the present invention a material is provided to use in forming recording heads which has reduced magnetostriction and good magnetic properties. In another embodiment of the present invention disk drives and tape drives are provided having recording heads formed from a material having reduced magnetostriction and good magnetic properties. The reduced magnetostriction in a material according to one embodiment of the present invention provides a significant improvement in the performance of the recording heads. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In a prefered embodiment the material according to the present invention is a repeating sequence of three layers. One layer is made from an alloy of NiFe. Another layer comprises FeX(N) where the (N) indicates a nitrogenated film and the additional element, X, is preferentially Ta but can be selected from a group of other elements. The third layer, disposed between the FeX(N) and NiFe layers is tantalum. The sequence of three layers is repeated to obtain the required thickness for the final material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The material has an intrinsically smaller value of magnetostriction and the magnetostriction is usually decreased with annealing resulting in simplified processing. The material also has improved magnetic moment compared with permalloy. Other aspects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description, which when taken along with the drawings, illustrate by way of invention the principles of the invention.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the present invention can be incorporated into a disk drive generally referred to as <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The disk drive <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes at least one recording disk <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The disk <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is mounted on a spindle <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> which is connected to a motor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. During the operation of the disk drive <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the motor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> spins the spindle <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> thereby rotating the disk <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. A slider <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> which has an attached recording head is connected to a suspension <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The suspension <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is attached to an arm <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The arm <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> has a coil <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> mounted on a distal end from the suspension <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. During normal operation the actuator assembly which includes the slider <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, the suspension <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, the arm <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, and the coil <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> rotates about a pivot point <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> defined by the location of an actuator post <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> A detailed view of the recording head mounted on the slider is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The slider <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> has a surface <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> which is in close proximity to the recording disk. This surface <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is commonly called the air bearing surface (ABS). The slider <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> also has a trailing surface <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> upon which a recording head <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is constructed which will be described in detail below. The recording head <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> includes a read element <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> and a write element <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> which will be described in more detail with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The view of the trailing surface <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> of the slider <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> shows metallic pads <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> for making connections to the recording head <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, coils <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> for energizing the write element, and an upper pole <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> of the write element <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. The view of the air bearing surface <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> usually shows a portion of the upper pole <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> of the write element <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>, a portion of the lower pole <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> of the write element <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>, a read sensor <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, and two shields <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> disposed around the read sensor <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. The write element <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is comprised of the upper pole <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, the lower pole <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, and the coils <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Tape drives can be used for storage and retrieval of digital information and for recording and playback of audio or video information. The recording heads using for digital applications generally have limited mobility. For example in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3 a</cross-reference> typical tape drive <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> for digital information is shown. The tape drive <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> has at least one non-rotating recording head <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. Typically there are several recording heads in a row and the head assembly has the capability of some limited lateral movement to compensate for shifts in tape position. In addition to a recording head <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> the tape drive <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> has a tape transport for advancing a tape <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> from a first reel <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> to a second reel <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>. The reels <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> (sometimes called spools) can be individual devices or they can be contained in a cassette housing. Typically the tape transport includes one or more rollers <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> to help position and move the tape <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> across the recording head <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Another style of tape drive <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, is commonly used for recording audio and video information. The tape drive in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> typically has two or more recording heads <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> mounted in a rotating drum <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. The tape <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> is moved past the rotating drum <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. There are typically two reels <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> which can be independent or contained in a cassette housing. Typically the tape transport includes one or more rollers <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> which help position and move the tape <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> across the recording heads <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> on the rotating drum <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the basic features of the write element <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> of the recording heads for both disk drives and tape drives are described. The write element <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is comprised of an upper pole element <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, a lower pole element <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>, and a number of coils <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> disposed between the upper <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> and lower <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> poles. There is a gap <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> between the two poles <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> near the recording medium commonly called the write gap. The poles <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> are in magnetic contact at the distal end <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> of the poles from the write gap <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows the upper pole <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> and the lower pole <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> as having a series of thin laminations <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> in accordance with the present invention. While the write element <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is described with reference to the slider <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> it will abe appreciated by those skilled int the art that a similar write element could be used with the tape head <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> or the tape head <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> A tape head which incorporates the present invention is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. The view in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is the recording head <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> as it is presented to the moving tape. In the usual configuration several tape heads are mounted side by side along a row. The view in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is of a single recording head <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> in the row. Typically there would be a head to the left <highlight><bold>616</bold></highlight>, the n&minus;1 head, and a head to the right <highlight><bold>618</bold></highlight>, the n&plus;1 head. Each recording head comprises a write element and a read element. The write element comprises a lower pole <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> called P1 and an upper pole <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> called P2. The write gap <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> is the space between P1 <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> and P2 <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>. The read element comprises a sensor <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> which is disposed between a lower shield <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> and an upper shield <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight>. In the present invention either P1 <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> or P2 <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> or both P1 and P2of the write element is formed from laminated material comprising NiFe/Ta/FeX(N). Also either the lower shield <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> or the upper shield <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> or both the lower and the upper shield can be formed from laminated material comprising NiFe/Ta/FeX(N). The direction of the tape movement across the recording head is shown <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates a head <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> according to an embodiment of the invention for use in a disk drive <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). The recording head is constructed on a substrate <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> usually formed from a rigid ceramic material. The read element comprises a sensor <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> which is disposed between a lower shield <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> and an upper shield <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>. The write element is comprised of a lower pole <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> called P1 and an upper pole <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> called P2. The write gap <highlight><bold>714</bold></highlight> is the space between P1 <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> and P2 <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight>. The constituents of the write head and read head are usually embedded in a matrix of insulating material <highlight><bold>718</bold></highlight> such as alumina. In the present invention either P1 <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> or P2 <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> or both P1 and P2 of the write element is formed from laminated material comprising NiFe/Ta/FeX(N). The direction of the disk movement relative to the recording head is shown <highlight><bold>716</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Disclosed here and shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a high moment iron rich layer <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> laminated with a NiFe alloy <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> where every other interface between the aforementioned layers has an intervening thin Ta layer <highlight><bold>806</bold></highlight>. Due to the low thickness, the presence of the intervening Ta layer <highlight><bold>806</bold></highlight> does not result in a significant reduction of magnetic moment. In addition, the iron rich layer <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> is alloyed with a another element or combination of elements up to 10% by weight to improve the corrosion resistance of iron. The iron is also nitrogenated to improve wear resistance. The result is a laminated structure which has higher moment than Ni(80%)Fe(20%), good magnetostriction, and good corrosion resistance. Functionally, it is not important if the basic sequence is NiFe/Ta/FeX(N) or FeX(N)/Ta/NiFe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The preferred embodiment for a laminated material which has excellent magnetostriction and has good magnetic properties is a repeating sequence of NiFe/Ta/FeX(N). The first sequence is labeled as <highlight><bold>808</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. The second sequence is also shown <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight>. The sequences are repeated <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> until a final desired thickness is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The element X alloyed with iron in the FeX(N) layer is Ta in the preferred embodiment. However other elements or combination of elements will also be suitable. A non-exhaustive list of other suitable elements includes Ru, Al, Cr, Nb, Ti, Zr, Mo, V, W, Hf, Ga, Ge, Si, B, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Mn, and Zn. These elements generally improve the soft magnetic properties of pure iron and also generally improve corrosion resistance of iron. Substantially pure iron can also be used but is more susceptible to corrosion. The amount of X in the FeX(N) can range up to about 10% by weight. Nitrogenation is indicated by the N in parentheses. This means the films are intended to have nitrogen incorporated in the structure, but not to have any specific nitride phases present. The presence of nitride phases usually results in a decrease in the magnetization and the loss of soft magnetic properties, e.g. an undesireable increase in Hc and anisotropy field (Hk). Using the sputtering conditions listed below, the amount of nitrogen in the FeX(N) is typically between 5 to 7 atomic %. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> This invention was reduced to practice by depositing experimental films using radio frequency diode sputtering. The constructed films are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, b, c</italic></highlight>, and <highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>. Other techniques are suitable including radio frequency magnetron sputtering, direct current diode and magnetron sputtering, or any combination of RF and DC sputtering, or ion beam deposition. A negative voltage bias was applied to the substrates during deposition. A small external magnetic field (&lE;70 Oe) was applied in the plane of the substrate during the deposition of the films of the present invention to provide uniaxial magnetic anisotropy. The field was supplied by the use of bar magnets embedded in the substrate holder or pallet and positioned close to the substrates. The field may be applied by other means such as a series of parallel wires behind the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In general the thickness of the Ta layer can range from very thin to about 100 A. The thickness of the Ta layer <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> in the experimental films was 35 Angstroms (A). The thickness of the FeX(N) layer <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> and NiFe layer <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> can range from about 100 to 1000 A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> All the films described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, b, c</italic></highlight>, and <highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>are approximately 1.5 microns thick. The targets used were FeTa(2 atomic % Ta), NiFe(Ni86% Fe14% and Ni93% Fe7%), and substantially pure Ta. The composition of the films made from the NiFe targets matched the composition of the targets. However the Ta content in the FeTa films was enriched somewhat compared to the target. The deposition rate for the FeTa(N) and NiFe layers was about 70 A/min and somewhat less for the Ta layer. The process pressure was about 2&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;2 </superscript></highlight>mbar. The argon flow was 60 standard cubic centimeters per second (sccm) for all layers. Nitrogen was introduced only during the deposition of the FeTa layer. The temperature of the pallet and wafer surface was between 85 and 90&deg; C. immediately after completion of the film. The annealing was done at 250&deg; C. for 6 hours in an external magnetic field under a rough vacuum. The field matched the orientation of the field used during film deposition. The magnetostriction was measured on silicon strips and the magnetic properties and stress values were measured on silicon wafers. Negative stress is compressive (film wants to expand off the substrate) and positive stress is tensile (film want to pull in on itself and the wafer becomes concave). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, b, c</italic></highlight>, and <highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>show the structures of the constructed laminated films for both the present invention and comparison films. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>shows film &num;1 where the basic sequence of layers is 500A of Ni(86%)Fe(14%) <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight>, 35 A of Ta <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>, and 300 A of FeTa(N) <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight>. This basic sequence <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight> of layers was repeated 19 times to obtain the desired final thickness of about 1.5 microns. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>shows the sequence of layers for film &num;2 which is the same as film &num;1 except that the Ta layer <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> is missing. Film &num;2 was constructed to compare with film &num;1 and show the benefit of the Ta layer <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>. The nitrogen flow during the FeTa layer <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> deposition was 3.0 sccm for films &num;1 and &num;2. Films &num;3 and &num;4, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, are similar to films &num;1 and &num;2 except that the thickness of the FeTa layer <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> and NiFe layer <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> were 400 A each. And the nitrogen flow during the FeTa layer deposition was 4.0 sccm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The evaluation data for films &num;1, &num;2, &num;3, and &num;4 (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, b, c</italic></highlight>, and <highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>) is tabulated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. The saturated moment, Ms, for the finished films averaged about 13 kG. This is substantially higher than the value of about 10 kG for non-laminated Ni(80%)Fe(20%). Annealing generally decreases the magnetostriction of the as-deposited film for the laminations with interleaved Ta layers. Without the Ta layer <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>, the magnetostriction generally increases with annealing. The stress in the final film has the opposite trend. However, stress is sensitive to deposition conditions and may vary somewhat. The low value of magnetostriction in the invented films &num;1 and &num;3 (&lE;&verbar;2&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;6</superscript></highlight>&verbar;) significantly reduces the burden of managing the film stress. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Corrosion measurements of single layers of FeTa(N) films and Fe(N) films of similar nitrogen content reveals the FeTa(N) films to have the same or better corrosion resistance as the Fe(N) layers when subjected to a chlorine based corrosive environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows the theta-2theta x-ray diffraction scan on as-deposited laminate films with and without the 35 A Ta layer <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> under the FeTa(N) layer <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight>. The specific films are Ni(93%)Fe(7%)(400 A)/Ta(35 A)/FeTa(N)(400 A) (sequence repeated 19 times) and the counterpart film without the 35 A Ta layer. Nitrogen flow during FeTa(N) deposition was 2.0 sccm. The (200) crystal structure is preferred in both the FeTa(N) and NiFe layers in the laminate film with the Ta layers at the expense of the NiFe(111), Fe(110), and NiFe(220) crystal structures. The higher peak intensities for the NiFe peaks over the Fe based peaks reveals a higher defect density or smaller grain size in the FeTa(N) layers. The presence of nitrogen in the interstitial sites in the FeTa film are the source of these crystalline defects and also results in small grains. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The Ta layer influences the crystal structure of both the FeTa(N) and the NiFe layers in the laminate films. The following mechanism may explain this influence. The magnetostriction in a single crystal Ni&lsqb;100&rsqb; is more negative than &lsqb;110&rsqb; or &lsqb;111&rsqb; Ni single crystals. The magnetostriction in a single crystal Fe&lsqb;100&rsqb; is more positive than in &lsqb;110&rsqb; or &lsqb;111&rsqb; Fe single crystals. If the influence on the magnetostiction of the entire laminate film is more predominantly dictated by the NiFe layers rather than the FeTa(N) layers, then the enhancement of the NiFe&lsqb;200&rsqb; crystal structure with the presence of the Ta layer would decrease the magnetostriction (increase it in a negative direction). However, usually the magnetostriction in a film comprised of magnetic materials with different magnetic moments would be dominated by the component with the highest magnetic moment. The NiFe layer has a magnetic moment that is lower than FeTa, but with the addition of nitrogen to the FeTa layer the magnetic moment is decreased as the magnetostriction is increased and the soft magnetic properties are enhanced. Also, the tantalum layer itself acts as a getter of nitrogen. Thus the magnetostriction in the laminate films with the tantalum layer would be less positive than in the laminate films with no tantalum layer even when the nitrogen content is similar for both. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been shown and described with respect to preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that changes in form and detail may be made in these embodiments without departing from the scope and teaching of the invention. Accordingly, the multilayered film herein disclosed is to be considered as merely illustrative and the invention is to be limited only as specified in the claims. </paragraph>
