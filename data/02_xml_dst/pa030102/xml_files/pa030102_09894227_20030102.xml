<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">Presented is a method and system for visually depicting performance levels in a workplace experiencing time-varied workloads. Call centers, an example of such workplaces, are complex environments that receive a plurality of incoming calls regarding a number of different issues. Each call center establishes metrics to answer a certain percentage of calls within a certain period of time. A graphical depiction using a reference time period as the horizontal axis, such as the length of work day, and a response time, such as the length of time an incoming caller has to wait before being answered, on the vertical axis can be used to convey to a call center manager a call centers ability to meet its metric. As calls come into the call center a symbol is placed horizontally on the graph corresponding to the time during the reference time period that the call was received and vertically according to the time the caller had to wait before a call center agent answered the call. Superimposed on the graph, as a horizontal line is the call center service metric indicating the time by which it is desired that a certain percentage of calls are answered. Additionally calls that are abandoned by the caller before being answered can be differentiated on the graph using a different color or symbol shape. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present method and system are in the field of performance measurement. More particularly, presented is a method and system for providing a visual representation of workplace performance. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Today&apos;s workplaces are typically staffed on the basis of forecast workload. Correspondingly, there are performance expectations on how fast a workload is processed and services are provided. Emergency rooms, for example, are staffed on the basis of forecast patient load and expectations of how fast each patient needs to be treated. Loan offices are staffed on the forecast of financing needs of a community and the expectation of how long it should take for a loan to close. Likewise, call centers are staffed using forecasts of call volumes and service level expectations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Performance expectations can take many forms. They can be expressed to a workplace as goals or standards and serve to motivate and discipline employees. Regardless of the basis, the establishment of such goals plays a critical role in any endeavor&apos;s success. As organizations strive to achieve these goals, they often establish metrics, or a system of measurements and standards designed to evaluate organizational performance. One such metric in call center operations measures the responsiveness of the center to incoming calls. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A performance metric entitled, service level, examines what percentage of calls are answered within a specified time limit. The longer the customer has to wait for the call center to respond the lower the service level. A typical example of a call center service level metric is to have eighty percent of the incoming calls answered within twenty seconds. But metrics are dynamic management tools that must be tailored to specific working environments. In the service industry the provided service identifies the competitive market. Evaluating a workplace&apos;s performance in providing a service can include several differing criteria. In the call center environment both the percentage of calls answered and the time taken by an agent to answer a call can vary depending on the needs and goals of the company. Likewise, the service level metric, which is a means to evaluate a center&apos;s performance, can vary from call center to call center. Another metric useful in call center management is the abandon rate, which specifies the percentage of callers who abandon their calls or hang up before they reach a representative. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> While the service level and the abandonment rate are easily ascertainable statistics, they fail, standing alone, to quickly convey to the call center manager an indication of a customer&apos;s tolerance for delays in reaching an agent or an understanding of the customer&apos;s call center experience. Statistical data does not provide a means to describe the relationship between the amount of time a typical caller has to wait before reaching a representative and the volume of calls being received by the call center. Current methods fail to present any indication of how performance levels vary over a specified period of time. Furthermore, statistical data is by definition historical resulting in a deficit of any real-time or near real-time capability to monitor performance levels. Lacking an understanding and visualization of the overall customer experience as well as the fluctuations in forecast workload results in managers being ill equipped to motivate employees. Similarly, managers are ineffective at adjusting workplace procedures and schedules to better meet the metrics and increase overall productivity. Without the proper indication of performance levels, challenging yet ascertainable metrics are more difficult to design, often causing performance and revenue to suffer. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Presented is a system and method for visualizing performance levels of a workplace in a time-varying environment. One possible application for such a method and system is visualizing service levels and abandonment rates for call centers. In one embodiment a display includes a graphical depiction generated from statistical information regarding incoming call volume, call center responsiveness, and abandonment time. In one embodiment, a graph is created consisting of two axes. Depicted on the horizontal axis is a reference time period corresponding, in the call center example, to how long the call center is open. This reference time is typically the work day but can include any other reference time period that can enhance the call center manager&apos;s ability to evaluate the call center&apos;s performance. The vertical axis on the display represents response time, which in an embodiment applicable to the call centers is the time required for each call to be answered by an agent. For each call received by the call center during the reference time period a symbol is placed on the display according to values represented by these two axes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The display aggregates the calls that a call center receives during the reference period and provides historical data for trend analysis. In another embodiment, different call centers&apos; performance levels are overlaid onto a particular display using different symbols to illustrate relative performance levels. Superimposed on the display, in one embodiment, is a horizontal line depicting the service level metric. This metric represents the goal established by the organization to answer a certain percentage of calls within a certain time period. Similarly, calls that are abandoned by the caller are differentiated from calls answered by the call center to provide the call center manager an indication of caller patience as it varies during the time period. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> A system and method for depicting performance levels in complex environments are described. In the description that follows, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be evident, however, to one skilled in the art that the method and system presented may be practiced without these specific details. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Workplaces that deal with time-varying workloads typically use metrics to evaluate their performance. An embodiment of a method for visually depicting performance levels in a time-varied workplace uses a graph where the horizontal axis represents a reference time period, such as the daily hours of operation, and the vertical axis represents response time. The reference time period and response time can be varied to accommodate various industries. For example a hospital emergency room&apos;s reference time period may be a full 24 hour day while a bank loan office may be only from nine in the morning to four in the afternoon. Similarly, the response time can be defined to facilitate a manager&apos;s understanding of the workplace&apos;s performance. A metric corresponding to a particular response time can be depicted by a line superimposed on the graph. For each input, a symbol is placed on the graph corresponding to the appropriate position as defined by the response time and reference period. For example, a symbol representing the time that elapsed until a physician was able to see a non-critical patient at 3:00 AM in a hospital emergency room is placed on a graph and compared to a metric regarding desired response time for non-critical patients. Similarly the response time of an agent in a call center can be visualized using another embodiment of the claimed method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> A call center, sometimes referred to as a contact center, is an organization that answers and responds to telephone calls and other communication media from customers for one or more particular organizations. Call centers also respond to other customer contacts, such as e-mail, faxes, and voice over Internet protocol, and web chat. Such centers possess a variety of resources. A resource can be the equipment, the employees, the facilities, or any other asset that facilitates the business in achieving its purpose. In a call center the individual employees answering the calls are agents and each possesses a particular skill set. Each employee is therefore an example of a resource with specialized skills. For example, one agent may be able to respond to technical problems, another may specialize in billing questions, and still another may specialize in taking product orders. Each agent likely possesses multiple skill sets and a call center manager&apos;s challenge is to optimize the agents&apos; tasks so as to maximize the utilization of these skill sets without compromising the functionality of the center, thus minimizing cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Call center managers must also strive to maximize productivity of the call center. A critical element of obtaining enhanced productivity is establishing challenging yet obtainable goals. Once established and conveyed to the call center agents, the call center manager must monitor and assess the center&apos;s performance and adjust resource allocation accordingly. An embodiment of a method for visually depicting performance levels in a time-varying environment can be used in the call center environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is an embodiment of a system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, for providing a graphical depiction of service levels preformed by a call center to aid a manager in assessing call center performance. The system includes multiple client computers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, which are coupled to the server <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, through a network, <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. The network <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, can be any network, such as a local area network, a wide area network, or the Internet. The client computers each include one or more processors and one or more storage devices. Each of the client computers also includes a display device, and one or more input devices. All of the storage devices store various data and software programs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the method for providing a graphical depiction of performance levels is carried out on the system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, by software instructions executing on one or more of the client computers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. The software instructions may be stored on the server <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, or on any one of the client computers. For example, one embodiment presents a hosted application used by a call center of an enterprise that requires complex scheduling of many employees. The software instructions are stored on the server and accessed through the network by a client computer operator of the enterprise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In other embodiments, the software instructions may be stored and executed on the client computer. A user of the client computer with the help of a user interface can enter data required for the execution of the software instructions. Data required for the execution of the software instructions can also be accessed via the network and can be stored anywhere on the network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a flow diagram of an embodiment of a method for providing a visualization of service levels in a call center environment. As calls enter the call center, data is gathered concerning the type of call and the time that the call was placed <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. From that information a display is created consisting of a horizontal axis depicting a reference time such as but not limited to the work day and a vertical axis representing the response time including the elapsed time from when the call was placed until the caller reaches an agent <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. For each call that is assigned to a call center a symbol is placed on the display positioned horizontally according to the time during the reference period that the call was received and vertically according to the time that elapsed until the call was answered <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Associated with the display is at least one service level metric. The user can define the metric in a variety of ways such the percentage of calls that are desired to be answered within a certain period <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. For example, for a particular call center, the user may establish a performance or service level metric indicating that it is desirable for 80% of the calls to be answered within 20 seconds. This metric is conveyed on the display as a horizontal line positioned vertically at the time specified by which calls are to be answered <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. In the previous example a horizontal line would appear at the 20-second mark. As symbols are placed on the display calls that are abandoned by the caller are differentiated <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, from calls that are answered <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. Such differentiating means include but is not limited to altering the color and shape of the symbol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a display of an embodiment of a method for visualizing performance levels as typically seen on a user&apos;s computer screen. The display is defined by the vertical axis representing the response time until an incoming call is either answered or abandoned <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, and the horizontal axis represents a reference time period such as a typical work day <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. Symbols are located in the field of the display positioned horizontally and vertically as described herein <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. Calls that are abandoned are differentiated from calls that are answer by such means as a different shape or a different color <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. Finally, the performance level metric indicating the desired time limit by which a certain percentage of calls are answered is indicated by a horizontal line <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>, positioned along the vertical axis according to the time limit imposed in the metric. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Calls coming into a call center are typically managed on a first come first served basis and being first functionally partitioned. Functional partitioning is done through an interactive process where the caller answers a few brief questions to better direct the call to the call center possessing the expertise that the caller desires. Calls that require an agent with a certain set of skills are directed to agents possessing those skills. Once a particular skill set has been identified calls are placed in a queue and answered on a first come first serve basis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The time that a caller waits in the queue before being answered fluctuates over the reference time period and between specialties of the agents. Organizations develop metrics to evaluate if the period of waiting meets the organization&apos;s performance goals. As described herein, a typical call center service level goal can be to answer a certain percentage of the incoming calls within a fixed time of their arrival. To depict the ability or inability of the call center to meet these goals a visual display can be generated. As the day progresses a symbol can be placed on the graph representing each call that the call center receives. The symbol is positioned horizontally corresponding to the time that the call was placed and vertically according to the time that the caller had to wait before an agent answered the call or the caller hung up. Thus the call center manager can, in one embodiment, gain historical information regarding the call center&apos;s performance as well as real time data concerning agent workload. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The display can immediately indicate periods of increased call volume or density as well as the inability of the call center to adequately handle the calls. This information can be utilized to alter the manning schedule or allocation of incoming calls to this particular call center. For example a visual representation of service levels may indicate that the call center routinely experiences an excessive amount of calls between 1 and 2 PM where the agents fail to meet an established metric of answering 80% of the calls in 20 seconds. Knowing this information, the call center manager can rearrange the lunch schedule or even find temporary manning to ensure resources are on hand to respond to the increased volume of work. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In an additional embodiment, the display conveys historical data to the call center manager to aid in establishing future metrics and evaluating center performance. Rather than displaying the published service level metric, the display can display time that a given percentage of callers had to wait prior to talking to an agent. For example, using historical data for a certain time period a call center manager could observe that on average 80% of the calls were answered within 45 seconds instead of the desired 20. In the alternative a metric could be displayed indicating what percentage of calls were answered in 20 seconds. Thus the graph could convey to the call center manager a plurality of tools to aid in fostering productivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, multiple performance level metrics of an organization can be superimposed to give the manager immediate feedback if the workplace is meeting organizational goals. Using the metrics as a guide, the manager can initiate changes in the staffing of the workplace to decrease the peaks and valleys of the workplace&apos;s performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> A further embodiment of the claimed invention enables, another aspect of call center operations, the presence of abandoned calls, to be placed in concert with the visual representation of call center service levels. Along with symbols indicating when agents answer calls, calls that are abandoned by the caller can also be displayed, differentiated from calls answered by agents by using a symbol of a different color or shape. This can provide the call center manager feedback regarding the patience of the caller and how the patience level of callers varies throughout the day. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As mentioned herein, a visual depiction of incoming calls to a service center can aid a call manager in scheduling resources to meet organizational goals. In another embodiment of the claimed invention, a method for visualizing performance levels in a time-varied environment can be coupled with a scheduling process to ensure accurate and efficient manning. For example, the depiction of incoming calls for a reference time period can be stored and aggregated statistically to gain a historical account for how work volume varies over a particular length of time. The information can be utilized to more effectively schedule call workplace resources. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> While an embodiment described herein provides a historical record of performance, another embodiment includes a real-time display of performance. As the reference time period elapses, a typical work day for example, the graphical interface can be updated at specific intervals up to and including on a real-time basis. This would provide the current workplace manager real-time information on the performance of the workplace and enable performance and resource parameters adjustments according to real-time events. For example a sudden spike in calls at a call center may result in an earlier than normal cancellation of a break period or an adjustment of a scheduled meeting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Using different symbols or colors to aid in differentiation and comparison of multiple work centers is another embodiment of the claimed method and system. Data from numerous work centers can be aggregated and displayed on one graph to benchmark performance of one work place against another. In one embodiment different colors can be used to differentiate different work centers and the size of the symbols can be used to represent the volume or density of work. Another version can display lines indicating average performance over time where the color indicates the work center&apos;s identity and the width of the line represents the density of work at a particular time during the reference period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The particular embodiments shown and described are for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from its spirit or essential characteristics. References to details of particular embodiments are not intended to limit the scope of the claims. </paragraph>
