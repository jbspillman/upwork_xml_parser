<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to the field of photovoltaic power generation. More specifically, the present invention relates to the field of utility-scale high-concentration photovoltaic power generation. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Silicon photovoltaic (PV) cells directly convert light into electricity. This provides a non-polluting renewable source of electrical energy. An electrical generating system utilizing PV cells is a PV system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> PV systems are generally made up of arrays of PV cells (PV arrays). PV arrays may be fixed, or may have one-axis or two-axis tracking. Fixed arrays are substantially immovable. At any given instant, maximum power output is obtained when the angle of solar incidence is perpendicular to the effective aperture (i.e., receptive surface area of the array). That is, a line between the sun and the array is perpendicular to the plane of the aperture. The average annual output of a fixed PV array is maximized when the array is aimed approximately at mean true solar noon. That is, the array would ideally be positioned so the plane of the aperture is substantially perpendicular to a line extending to the mean true solar noon position of the sun. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A PV array using one-axis tracking pivots around a single axis to better track the sun across the sky. Ideally, one-axis tracking causes the angle of solar incidence to be coincident with a plane perpendicular to both the plane of the aperture and the plane of rotation of the array. The average annual output would be maximized when the array is angled to track approximately through the mean true solar noon position of the sun. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A PV array using two-axis tracking pivots around two axes to best track the sun across the sky. Because two axes are used, the sun may be accurately tracked to provide a substantially perpendicular angle of solar incidence at all times from dawn to dusk every day of the year. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> PV arrays may be non-concentrating or concentrating. In a non-concentrating array, sunlight falls directly upon the PV cells making up the array. The aperture is therefore the collective area of the PV cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Non-concentrating PV arrays produce power from sunlight with any reasonable positive angle of incidence. Non-concentrating arrays therefore lend themselves to fixed and one-axis tracking arrays, where the angle of solar incidence is not normally perpendicular to the plane of the aperture. This, of course, does not exclude a non-concentrating array from having two-axis tracking. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In a concentrating photovoltaic array, sunlight falling upon lenses or mirrors is focussed onto the PV cells making up the array. That is, the aperture is substantially equal to the area of the lenses or mirrors, and the sunlight is focussed onto the substantially smaller area of the PV cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Concentrating PV arrays require that the sunlight be focussed upon the PV cells. To do this, each PV cell is located substantially at the primary focal point of the associated lens or mirror. This means that the angle of solar incidence must be such that the sunlight is directed to the appropriate focal points. The effective plane of the aperture is therefore perpendicular to the solar incidence. A typical concentrating PV array uses two-axis tracking to maintain perpendicularity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The higher the concentration of an array, the smaller the amount of PV cell area required for a given aperture. The maximum concentration is partly limited by the ability of the individual PV cells to handle and dispose of heat. High-concentrating photovoltaic (HCPV) arrays having concentrations between 200 and 300 are fully realizable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A problem arises with HCPV arrays in that the high concentration necessitates a high tracking accuracy. This results in more precise (and more expensive) two-axis tracking mechanisms than are required for lower-concentration arrays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Typical PV systems may be instrument-scale, small-scale, or utility-scale. An instrument-scale PV system typically uses a single non-concentrating fixed array to power an individual device. Typically, the PV array is proportionate to the device to be powered. That is, an array may contain one to dozens of PV cells and have a power output from a few milliwatts to several watts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> A small-scale PV system typically uses non-concentrating fixed or one-axis tracking arrays to fully or partially power a residence, commercial establishment, or an industrial or agricultural device (e.g., a remotely located pump). A small-scale PV system may be formed of one or more arrays, may contain from several hundreds to several thousands of PV cells, and have a power output in the range of one to twenty-five kilowatts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> A utility-scale PV system is a solar power-generation station, and serves essentially the same functions as fossil fuel or nuclear power-generation stations. Solar power generation has an advantage in that solar energy is a fully renewable, non-polluting resource. The sunlight is present each day weather permits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The electricity produced by solar power-generation stations, however, currently has a considerably greater cost per megawatt than that produced by fossil fuel and nuclear power-generation stations. There exists a long-felt need for reductions in the per-megawatt cost of solar power generation to make utility-scale PV systems more feasible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> A utility-scale PV system may be used by a utility to produce power for the public power grid. The power thus produced may be used to augment the power already available on the public grid during the times of sunlight, thereby providing supplemental power when it is most needed. A utility-scale PV system may also be used to provide power where the public power grid is not available, e.g., a remote village. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> A utility-scale PV system may be formed of large arrays or array clusters containing from thousands to millions of PV cells. Each large array or array cluster typically has a power output in excess of twenty kilowatts, with the system having a total power output of tens or hundreds of megawatts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The arrays or array clusters of a utility-scale PV system may be independently coupled to the power grid. Therefore, while a PV system may have a number of substantially identical arrays, this is not a requirement. A given PV system may be a power-generation complex having a mixture of non-concentrating and/or concentrating fixed, one-axis tracking, and/or two-axis tracking arrays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Utility-scale PV systems may have power outputs of tens or hundreds of megawatts. The per-unit-area fabrication costs of a PV array decrease as the array is increased in size. Also, the cost of PV cells (the silicon cost) is a significant factor in large arrays. The greater the ratio of aperture area to PV cell area, the lower the silicon cost of a given array. Concentrating arrays have fewer PV cells per unit area of aperture than non-concentrating arrays. At some point in the transition between small-scale and utility-scale systems, it becomes preferable to utilize large HCPV arrays over non-concentrating arrays. The use of HCPV arrays, however, requires more expensive two-axis tracking. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The arrays of a utility-scale PV system may be quite large. Such arrays are often too large to be transported by conventional means (e.g., by rail and/or truck). Such large arrays must be either fully or partially assembled in the field. This results in a significant increase in labor costs and in the time it takes to bring the array on line. When the arrays are HCPV arrays, the required tracking accuracy requires an increase in field alignment time. With conventional field assembly and alignment techniques, the result may be an untenable overall PV system cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Desirably, HCPV arrays are rigid. That is, an HCPV array desirably has all PV cells therein properly aligned at all times and in all attitudes. If an HCPV array has insufficient rigidity, then that array is subject to deflection. Deflection is the optical misalignment of one or more PV cells in an array due to bending of the array. A deflected PV cell has a different optical alignment than a non-deflected PV cell. An array may suffer deflection due to gravity (i.e., dead-load deflection) and wind (i.e., wind-load deflection). For arrays using lenses, the amount of dead-load deflection varies with the attitude of the array. That is, the dead-load deflection is most pronounced when the array is horizontal and substantially zero when the plane of the aperture is vertical. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Large HCPV arrays must be rigid enough to support their own weight while maintaining proper optical alignment of all PV cells therein. This typically results in arrays that have elaborate, cumbersome, and/or massive supporting structures. These complex supporting structures are themselves typically assembled on site, and therefore add to the cost increases. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a perspective front view of a portion of a utility-scale generating system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> having a plurality of supports <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows an oblique back view of a single support <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> with a plurality of high-concentration photovoltaic assemblies <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> coupled thereto, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows an oblique front view of a single such assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The following discussion refers to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> depicts a portion of a utility-scale high-concentration photovoltaic (HCPV) generating system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. For purposes of the present discussion, a photovoltaic system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is a system configured to convert light, i.e., electromagnetic radiation formed primarily of photons having greater energy than radio (i.e., microwave or millimeter-wave) radiation, into electrical energy (power). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> A utility scale HCPV system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> must be capable of generating a sufficient quantity of power to be practical for utility company use. For purposes of the present discussion, this is assumed to be at least 20 kW<highlight><subscript>P </subscript></highlight>(peak kilowatts). In the preferred embodiment depicted, system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> contains a plurality of supports (supporting tracking structures) <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, with each support <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> supporting a plurality of HCPV assemblies <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> HCPV assemblies <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are sized and configured to be factory assembled, then transported to the desired site and mounted to supports <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. This effects a significant reduction in assembly costs over on-site assembly. Additional cost reductions may be realized by configuring components of supports <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to also be factory assembled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment (discussed in more detail hereinafter), each HCPV assembly generates approximately 4.8 kW<highlight><subscript>P</subscript></highlight>. Each support <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> supports five HCPV assemblies <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, thereby producing 24 kW<highlight><subscript>P </subscript></highlight>per support <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> for system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The depiction of five assemblies <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> per support <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is arbitrary. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that supports <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be constructed that will support more than five assemblies <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Assemblies <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are high-concentration photovoltaic assemblies <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. System <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is therefore an HCPV system. Each support <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> incorporates high-accuracy two-axis tracking to maintain an aperture plane <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) of each assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> substantially perpendicular to the angle of solar incidence (not shown) in order for assemblies <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to function efficiently. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The design and implementation of supports <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is beyond the scope of the present invention. Any design and/or implementation well known to those skilled in the art may be used. In the preferred embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, each support <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is formed of a foundation <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, a support pedestal <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> anchored to foundation <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, a two-axis tracking mechanism <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> coupled to support pedestal <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, a torsion tube <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> coupled to tracking mechanism <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and a plurality of mounts <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> affixed to torsion tube <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and configured to couple to a frame <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of each HCPV assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Perimeter members <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, discussed in more detail hereinafter, form a substantially right parallelepipedic structure that defines the basic shape of HCPV assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, less frame <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. This structure has a longitudinal dimension (length) <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, a transverse dimension (breadth) <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, and a perpendicular dimension (depth) <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> relative to reference plane <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Length <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is measured in a longitudinal direction <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, i.e., a direction substantially parallel to reference plane <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> along an axis substantially parallel to the longest dimension of the right parallelepipedic structure. Breadth <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is measured in a transverse direction <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, i.e., a direction substantially parallel to reference plane <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and substantially perpendicular to longitudinal direction <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. Depth <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is measured in a perpendicular direction <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, i.e., a direction substantially perpendicular to reference plane <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment, frame <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is made up of two substantially parallel framing members <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Reference plane <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> passes through the centers of framing members <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, i.e., framing members <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are centered within HCPV assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Framing members <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> intersect HCPV assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> transversely, i.e., across breadth <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> through perimeter members <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> substantially parallel to aperture plane <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The length <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of each framing member is substantially equal to or greater than breadth <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Framing members <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are the primary load-bearing members of assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The entire weight of assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> rests upon framing members <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Framing members <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are therefore made of rigid metallic tubing. In the preferred embodiment, framing members <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are a conventional steel tubing having have a round-cornered rectangular cross section of approximately 12.7&times;17.8 cm (5&times;7 inches) and a wall thickness of approximately 0.64 cm (0.25 inch). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> A leg <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is affixed to each end of framing members <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> in a direction substantially perpendicular to reference plane <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Since framing members <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> have lengths <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> substantially equal to or greater than breadth <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, legs <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> are external to perimeter members <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> A foot <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is affixed to each end of each leg <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of frame <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Legs <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> are dimensioned so that the four feet <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> on front side <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of reference plane <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> lie in a front foot plane <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> substantially parallel to reference plane <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>.

Front and back foot planes <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> are farther from reference plane than front and back planes <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>), respectively. That is, legs <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> have a length <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> that is greater than depth <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of perimeter members <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The &ldquo;thickest&rdquo; parts of HCPV assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are at feet <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> on the ends of frame legs <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment, legs <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> are couple by crossbars <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>, giving frame <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> a substantially rectangular shape. It will be understood that crossbars <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> are an artifact of the assembly techniques and not a requirement of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a side view of a plurality of HCPV assemblies <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> coupled to a truck bed <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> for transport in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The following discussion refers to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3, 4</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Because feet <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> are at the dimensional extremities of HCPV assemblies <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, assemblies <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may be safely coupled to form a stack for storage and/or transport. This is exemplified in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, where a stack of HCPV assemblies <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is coupled to bed <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> of a truck <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> for transport. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Each assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is constructed for use out of doors. Each assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is therefore constructed to be exposed to the weather, including wind in excess of the &ldquo;wind&rdquo; created by truck <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> during transport. Hence, assemblies <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> need only be securely fastened (e.g., bolted) together and to truck bed <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> to allow safe transport. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has a length <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of at least 375 cm (147.5 inches) and no more than 1675 cm (659.5 inches), and a breadth <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of at least 240 cm (94.5 inches) and no more than 375 cm (147.5 inches). By adhering to these minimum and maximum dimensions, assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> remains large enough to be practical for a utility-grade system, yet small enough to be truck transportable. In the preferred embodiment, assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has a length of approximately 1362.7 cm (536.5 inches) and a breadth of 316.2 cm (124.5 inches). A stack of assemblies <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is therefore easily transportable by truck <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> without recourse to &ldquo;wide load&rdquo; or other restrictions. The ease of transport of factory-built assemblies <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> from factory to field site effects a further cost savings over the prior art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The following discussion refers to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Feet <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> on back side <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are configured to be coupled to mounts <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) of support <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Framing members <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> support the full weight of assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. This weight is transferred through legs <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and feet <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> to mounts <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. By coupling only to feet <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, support <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> supports assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Since mounts <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> couple only to feet <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, the physical mounting of an HCPV assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to a support <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> becomes a rapid and efficient operation. Indeed, the mounting of all assemblies <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to a given support <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is expected to be safely accomplished in less than a single day, with significantly reductions in crane time, field labor, and the costs thereof over the prior art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows a top view of HCPV assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> with front and back components removed, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows an enlargement of a central portion of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> demonstrating the coupling of frame <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> into assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The following discussion refers to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3, 4</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> A body of HCPV assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is made up of a plurality, including at least two but preferably more, of substantially parallel longitudinal members <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. A pair of substantially parallel transverse members <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is coupled to the ends of longitudinal members <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. Transverse members <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and outer ones of longitudinal members <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> together are perimeter members <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, and form a substantially right parallelepipedic structure having a substantially rectangular periphery <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. Interior ones of longitudinal members <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> divide an interior <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> into channels <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. Bulkheads <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> are coupled between adjacent ones of longitudinal members <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> at positions <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> having substantially regular intervals <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> to divide channels <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> into substantially right parallelepipedic chambers <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> By forming substantially right parallelepipedic chambers <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, all joins between longitudinal members <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and transverse members <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and between longitudinal members <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and bulkheads <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> are substantially right angles. This results in an efficient use of space and an economy of assembly. By coupling bulkheads <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> to longitudinal members <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> at substantially regular intervals <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight>, chambers <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> will all have substantially identical lengths and breadths (not specified). This allows all lenses and modules (discussed hereinafter) to be substantially identical, thereby effecting a quantity savings in the costs of these components and as ease of replacement thereof in the field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Framing members <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> have a center-to-center distance <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> substantially coincident with bulkhead positions <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> of HCPV assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Desirably, center-to-center distance <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> is at least 120 cm (47 inches) and no more than 350 cm (138 inches). This allows a reasonable spread between mounts <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of support <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, while still allowing the components of support <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (other than the foundation, which is typically cast on site) to be factory-built and transportable by standard trucks, thereby effecting further cost reductions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment, framing members <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are located at the bulkhead positions <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> adjacent to, but not at, a center of assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The bulkheads <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> located at these positions <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> are different from the bulkheads <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> located at other positions <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Each longitudinal member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> of HCPV assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is formed of three spars <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> coupled substantially edgewise over their lengths. Spars <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> on front and back sides <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of reference plane <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are contiguous over substantially length <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. A central spar <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is not contiguous, but is broken to allow passage of framing members <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>). This is discussed in more detail hereinafter in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Spars <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> each have a &ldquo;C&rdquo; cross section (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>). Desirably, spars <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are common framing members for commercial buildings, as used in the construction trades. These framing members need only be cut to length and joined. This eliminates the need for custom-made components and further lowers the fabrication costs of assemblies <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. In the preferred embodiment, all three spars <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are common 18-gauge framing members having substantially identical &ldquo;C&rdquo;-shaped cross sections of approximately 17.8&times;6.4 cm (7&times;2.5 inches). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Spars <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may be joined along their lengths by screws, bolts, rivets, welds, adhesives, or other fasteners (not shown) to form longitudinal members <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> as composite beams. This results in HCPV assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> being highly resistant to flexing in a perpendicular direction (i.e., substantially perpendicular to reference plane <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> When reference plane <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is horizontal, the ends of longitudinal members <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> protruding beyond framing members <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> act as cantilevers. Gravity, pulling on these cantilevers, causes the ends of longitudinal members <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> to deflect downward. This places spar <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> on front side <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of reference plane <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> in tension (i.e., upper-side spar <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is tension spar <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>) and spar <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> on back side <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of reference plane <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> in compression (i.e., back-side spar <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is compression spar <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>). Central spar <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is a filler spar <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Filler spar <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> serves to couple and separate tension and compression spars <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Because filler spar <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is coupled to tension and compression spars <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> throughout their lengths, filler spar <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> also serves to transfer shear between tension and compression spars <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. By being contiguous over their entire lengths, tension and compression spars <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> exhibit maximum longitudinal integrity. In the preferred embodiment, this results in a dead-load deflection at the ends of assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of less than 0.32 cm (0.125 inch). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Transverse members <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of HCPV assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are substantially identical in construction to longitudinal members <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. That is, each transverse member <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is formed of three spars <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> having &ldquo;C&rdquo;-shaped cross sections and coupled substantially edgewise over their lengths. Ideally, transverse members <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> utilize the same common 18-gauge framing members as longitudinal spars <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. Since frame <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> does not intersect transverse members <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, all three spars <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> thereof are contiguous over substantially breadth <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of HCPV assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Bulkheads <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>) also have a &ldquo;C&rdquo;-shaped cross section, but extend over depth <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The majority of bulkheads <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> (i.e., all except those coincident with framing members <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>) are substantially alike and may be formed of ordinary sheet metal on readily available brakes and other common machine shop tools. This, too, effects a reduction in assembly costs. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment, perimeter members <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> (i.e., transverse members <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and outer ones of longitudinal members <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>) are coupled together by overlapping spars <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and by corner plates <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 8</cross-reference>). This overlapping, in conjunction with corner plates <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, forms a strong and predominantly inflexible basic structure for assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Interior ones of longitudinal members <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> are coupled to transverse members <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> by flanges <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>) bent from the ends of spars <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Similar flanges <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>) couple bulkheads <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> to longitudinal members <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

At intervals substantially coinciding with the &ldquo;flat&rdquo; surfaces of longitudinal members <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> (i.e., the closed side of the &ldquo;C&rdquo;-shaped cross sections), framing members have affixed mounting brackets <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. Mounting brackets <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> extend in perpendicular direction <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Mounting brackets <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> couple framing members <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> to the tension, filler, and compression spars <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> of each longitudinal member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment, framing members <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are substantially centered on reference plane <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>.
