<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">An apparatus (and method) is provided that pumps (up or down) the voltage on a memory cell thereby increasing (above the logic one voltage value) or decreasing (below the logic zero voltage value) the voltage stored in the memory cell, and providing an increased differential on the bit lines during a subsequent read operation of the memory cell. When a logic one or zero voltage is coupled to the first plate of the memory cell for storage, the second plate is held at a voltage that is lower or higher, respectively (preferably a voltage that is the complement logic value of the value being stored). After the word line is deactivated (thereby decoupling the memory cell from the bit line and storing a logic one voltage value or logic zero voltage value), the voltage on the second plate is correspondently either raised or lowered. In the present invention, the second plate is raised or lowered to the precharge and equilibrate value (usually Vdd/2). This pumps the voltage stored in the memory cell to a higher voltage (if a logic one is stored) or a lower voltage (if a logic zero is stored). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In dynamic random access memories (DRAM), densities are increasing and operating voltages are decreasing. In addition, DRAMs are now being embedded with other logic and functionality on a single integrated circuit (IC). The technological drive toward higher densities, lower operating voltages and embeddedness for DRAMs are all contributing to a decreasing differential signal voltage (related to noise margin) detected on the bit lines during the read operation of a memory cell. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> With reference to the drawings, like reference characters designate like or similar elements throughout the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Now referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, there is shown a detailed diagram illustrating a memory array <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in accordance with the present invention. The memory array <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of memory cells arranged in rows and columns, with each row corresponding to a word line (0 thru N) and each column (0 thru N) corresponding to two bit lines (a bit line true (BLT) and a bit line complement (BLC)). Column 0 actually includes two sets of memory cells, with one set of memory cells associated with BLC <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and one set of memory cells associated with BLT <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. And column N includes two sets of memory cells, with one set of memory cells associated with BLCN <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and one set with BLTN <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. With each memory cell is associated an access device or transistor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> for coupling the memory cell to the respective bit line (BLC or BLT). Each memory cell comprises a capacitor or charge-storing device <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> (or element) having a first plate <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and a second plate <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, with a node coupling the first plate <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> to a S/D region of the access transistor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The access transistors <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are controlled by the respective word lines (WL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, WL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, etc.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In each column, the second plate of the capacitors (of the memory cells) is coupled to a cell plate line. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the set of memory cells associated with BLC <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and BLT <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> have their second plates <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> coupled to a cell plate line <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. Similarly, the set of memory cells associated with BLCN <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and BLTN <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> have their second plates <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> coupled to a cell plate line <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Also in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is shown bit line equilibrate and precharge circuitry (transistors <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>) coupled to a voltage reference source Vblp for precharging the bit lines to a reference voltage. A control signal, identified as SHORT ARRAY, provides the control mechanism for equilibrating and precharging the bit lines to the voltage Vblp. Also shown for each column 0 thru N are sense amplifiers <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> controlled by a signal SA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> For each set of memory cells associated with a respective pair of complement bit lines (i.e., BLC and BLT of the column), a voltage driver circuit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> provides a voltage source for each cell plate line connected to a set of memory cells (two sets of memory cells in each column with one set each associated with BLC and BLT; and a single cell plate line for both sets). As will be described further, and in accordance with the figures herein, the voltage driver circuit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> provides a high logic level voltage (approximately Vdd) to the second plate <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> of the capacitor element <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> when a low logic level voltage (approximately Vss or ground) is present on the bit line (BLT or BLC), and a low logic level voltage to the second plate <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> of the capacitor element <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> when a high logic level voltage is present on the bit line (BLC or BLT). Further, the voltage driver circuit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> provides substantially the same voltage as an intermediate voltage (e.g., approximately Vblp or Vdd/2) to the second plate <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> of the capacitor element <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> when the intermediate voltage level is present on the bit line (BLT or BLC). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Now referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, there is the voltage driver circuit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> in accordance with the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> preferably describes another embodiment where the voltage driver circuit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> couples the bit line BLT <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to the cell plate line <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> of the associated memory cells (all memory cells associated with BLC <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and BLT <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>). The voltage driver circuit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> includes a three-input XOR logic gate <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, with one input connected to BLT <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, one input connected to a signal LSBWL, one input connected to a signal TWIST, and the output connected to the cell plate line <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. The XOR gate <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is also connected to a line VL and a line VH. As will be appreciated, the line VH and VL provide a mechanism to turn-off operation of the XOR gate <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. When the voltage on VH and VL are approximately equal, no current flows and the XOR gate <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is inoperative. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The voltage levels on the lines VH and VL are set by operation of an n-channel transistor <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, a transmission gate <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, and a p-channel transistor <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>, as shown. A signal PUMP provides a control signal for determining the voltage on the lines VH and VL, and further provides control of another transmission gate <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> (part of the voltage driver circuit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>) coupling/decoupling the reference voltage Vblp to the cell plate line <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. In operation, when the PUMP signal is active, VH is high and VL is low, thereby providing power to the XOR gate <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and decoupling Vblp from the cell plate line <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. When the PUMP signal is inactive, the transistors <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> are turned off and the lines VH and VL are shorted together resulting in a voltage of approximately Vdd/<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> on lines VH and VL essentially turning off the XOR gate <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. In addition, the transmission gate <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> couples Vblp to the cell plate line <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, due to the memory cells associated with both bit lines in a column connected to a cell plate line (in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, cell plate line <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>), the XOR gate includes the input signal LSBWL. The input signal LSBWL corresponds to the least significant bit in the memory address (i.e., for even word lines, signal LSBWL has a predetermined logic level, and for odd word lines, signal LSBWL has the complement logic level) and assists in identifying the particular memory cell bit line (BLT or BLC) from which the &ldquo;true&rdquo; data is read/written. In other words, when memory cells associated with BLT <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are read/written, the voltage driver circuit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> applies an inverse (or complement) logic level voltage of the logic voltage level present on BLT <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> (the data read or written to the memory cell associated with BLT <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>) to the cell plate line <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> (BLT <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>&equals;high, cell plate line <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>&equals;low, and vice versa). In contrast, when memory cells associated with BLC <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are read/written, the voltage driver circuit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> applies the same logic level voltage as the logic voltage level present on BLT <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> (the logic complement of the data read or written to the memory cell associated with BLC <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>) to the cell plate line <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> (BLT <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>&equals;high, cell plate line <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>&equals;low, and vice versa). This function is accomplished using the signal LSBWL. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Also shown as an input to the XOR gate <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is the input signal TWIST. When non-twisted bit lines are utilized, the TWIST signal is not necessary and the XOR gate <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> may be configured as a two-input gate. When twisted bit lines are utilized, the TWIST signal is input to the XOR gate <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. As will be appreciated, a person of ordinary skill in the art is capable of generating the TWIST signal to correspond to, and identify, when certain memory cells are accessed and to which bit lines they correspond. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> As will be appreciated, the complement bit line BLC <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may be utilized to drive the voltage driver circuit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> instead of the true bit line BLT <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> (or the identifying numerals (BLT and BLC) can simply be switched in the FIGURES). Also, the transmission gates <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> may alternatively be single transistor gates (controlled by PUMP or the PUMP complement). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> It will be understood that the PUMP signal can be generated using a delayed version of the sense amplifier enable signal SA or generated from other clocking signals present in the memory array. Preferably, the PUMP signal is activated after the signal SA is activated and deactivated after the word line is deactivated. Alternatively, the PUMP signal may be deactivated after the SHORT ARRAY signal is activated (high), but this may cause additional power dissipation. One embodiment utilizes a delayed version of the signal SA. An alternative embodiment (not shown) utilizes the activation of the SHORT ARRAY signal to trigger the deactivation of the PUMP signal, or the deactivation/activation of some other timing signal to deactivate the PUMP signal at a time that is closely proximate the activation of the SHORT ARRAY signal. This provides the result that the voltage on the cell plate line <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> (i.e., the second plate <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> of the capacitor element <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>) is substantially the same voltage (at substantially the same time) as an intermediate voltage (Vblp or Vdd/2) when the intermediate voltage level is present on the bit line BLT. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> It will be understood that an additional voltage driver circuit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> with the same operation and description, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, is utilized for each additional column. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The general operation of the present invention is as follows: The bit line is equilibrated and pre-charged to an intermediate voltage. The word line is activated producing a small voltage differential across the true bit line and complement bit line (depending on the value stored in the active memory cell). The sense amplifier is enabled detecting the differential and generating a high logic voltage on the true bit line and a low logic voltage on the complement bit line, or vice versa, depending on the value stored in the active memory cell (read/refresh operation). As will be appreciated, the voltage values generated on the two bit lines will also depend on the logic value if the memory cell is being overwritten (write operation). Regardless of the logic voltage level (high or low) applied to the bit line of the active memory cell (being read/written), the complement logic voltage level (or substantially complement level) is applied to the cell plate line connected to the active memory cell. The word line is then deactivated storing the voltage present on the bit line to the capacitor (or charge-storing device) of the memory cell. After the word line is deactivated, an intermediate voltage is applied to the cell plate line connected to the previously active memory cell. Application of the intermediate voltage provides a &ldquo;pumping&rdquo; effect to the voltage stored on the memory cell, thereby raising/lowering the voltage of the stored value to a higher/lower voltage level (storing high/low). Operation of the present invention results in an increased bit line voltage differential during the subsequent read of the memory cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> As will be appreciated, the intermediate voltage is a predetermined voltage level in the range between the logic high voltage level and the logic low voltage level. Preferably, the intermediate voltage is substantially equal to Vblp (or Vdd/2). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Now referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference> (and with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>), there are shown detailed timing diagrams illustrating a read operation for a logic one and a logic zero, respectively, stored in the memory cell associated with BLT <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The read operation (reading a logic one stored in the memory cell) shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> generally begins at a time T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> when the SHORT ARRAY signal is deactivated (low) resulting in the precharge and equilibration of the bit lines (BLT, BLC) to a voltage Vblp (intermediate voltage). As will be appreciated, the Vblp voltage is also applied to the cell plate line <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> of the active memory cell (shown as Vplate). At a time T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the word line WL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is activated turning on the access transistor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and coupling the capacitor (or charge-storing device) <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to the bit line BLT <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. A dummy cell (not shown) is also activated coupling a voltage reference Vref (not shown, and preferably about Vdd/3) to the bit line BLC <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. A differential voltage is generated on the bit lines BLC <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and BLT <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. At a time T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the SA signal is activated. The activated sense amplifier <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> amplifies the differential voltage present on the bit lines BLC <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and BLT <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> generating a logic high voltage on the BLT <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and a logic low voltage on the BLC <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. After a predetermined delay (sufficient to allow the sense amplifier <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> to sense the bit lines and generate a logic high and logic low on the bit lines), a PUMP signal is activated which applies a logic low to the cell plate line <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. Because the voltage driver circuit couples the bit line BLT <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> (inverted) to the cell plate line <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> (Vplate), the voltage applied to the cell plate line <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> (Vplate) is a logic low voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> After the word line WL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is deactivated, and generally after the read operation is completed (or substantially completed), at a time T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the PUMP signal is deactivated resulting in application of the voltage Vblp (the intermediate voltage) to the cell plate line <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. Increasing the voltage of the cell plate line <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> from logic low to the intermediate voltage (after the memory cell is written logic high) provides the pumping mechanism that increases, or pumps, the voltage in the memory cell (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, identified as Vcell) to a value greater than the logic high voltage, providing the pump margin. The pumped voltage stored in the memory provides an increase in the voltage differential on the bit lines during a subsequent read operation of the memory cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Similarly, a read operation (reading a logic zero stored in the memory cell) shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is similar to the read operation in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. After a predetermined delay the PUMP signal is activated which applies a logic high to the cell plate line <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. Because the voltage driver circuit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> couples the bit line BLT <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> (inverted) to the cell plate line <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> (Vplate), the voltage applied to the cell plate line <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> (Vplate) is a logic high voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> After the word line WL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is deactivated, and generally after the read operation is completed (or substantially completed), at a time T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the PUMP signal is deactivated resulting in application of the voltage Vblp (the intermediate voltage) to the cell plate line <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. Decreasing the voltage of the cell plate line <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> from logic high to the intermediate voltage (after the memory cell is written logic low) provides the pumping mechanism that decreases, or pumps, the voltage in the memory cell (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, identified as Vcell) to a value less than the logic low voltage, providing the pump margin. The pumped voltage stored in the memory provides an increase in the voltage differential on the bit lines during a subsequent read operation of the memory cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The bit line input and the LSBWL input to the XOR gate <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> generate an output on the cell plate line <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> that is the complement logic level of the logic level on the bit line associated with the accessed memory cell. The optional TWIST input to the XOR gate can be utilized with twisted bit lines are present. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> It will be understood that all the relevant active circuitry, or operating voltages, should be designed to provide correct operation with a pumped voltage (high or low) stored in the memory cell. This may include ensuring that the pumped down voltage stored in the memory cell is not lower than the back bias voltage minus Vt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In general terms, the present invention provides a circuit and method of increasing the stored voltage (greater than a logic one voltage level) in a memory cell by holding the memory cell plate <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> at a logic low during the writing of a logic one to the memory cell, and then raising the voltage at the memory cell plate <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> to an intermediate voltage after the word line is deactivated. Similarly, it decreases the stored voltage (less than a logic zero voltage level) in a memory cell by holding the memory cell plate <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> at a logic high during the writing of a logic zero to the memory cell, and then decreasing the voltage at the memory cell plate <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> to an intermediate voltage after the word line is deactivated. This results in increased differential voltages on the bit lines during a read operation of the memory cell. </paragraph>
