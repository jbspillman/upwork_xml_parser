<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to progressive cavity pumps. More particularly, the present invention relates to the configuration of stators which are positioned over the rotor of the progressive cavity pump. The present invention also relates to mud pumps, as used in directional drilling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Progressive cavity pumps have been known since their invention was disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 1,892,217, entitled &ldquo;Gear Mechanism&rdquo; to Moineau. The helicoidal rotor and the stator engage with each other along a sealing line to create cavities which progress axially as the rotor is rotated relative to the stator. Because of the required sealing and sliding contact concept of a Moineau pump, the stator and the rotor become subject to extensive wear, which necessitates frequent replacement of the stator and/or the rotor. Commercially available Moineau pumps, as well as those described in the prior art, require extensive disassembly of the pumping apparatus to replace the worn stator and/or rotor, in addition to the downtime loss of use. In a pump device, rotary motion is applied to the rotor which causes fluids and solids to be passed therethrough. Where the progressive cavity device is used as a motor, one method is to apply fluid pressure to the cavity to cause the rotor to rotate, the power therefrom having many uses. In the case of use in drilling wells, the ability to decrease the frequency of downtime and extend the useful life of the motor is a desired objective. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The conventional Moineau pump and motor have used a rubber or elastomer material bonded to steel for the stator contact surface. Such elastomers include not only natural rubber, but also synthetics, such as G.R.S. neoprene, butyl and nitrile rubbers, although there are other types such as soft P.V.E. The key, of course, is to make the elastomer properly soft enough to maintain the sealed cavity, yet hard enough to withstand the abrasive wear from the working contact between the rotor and the stator. The rotor is usually made of steel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Rubber, when used as the stator contact surface, is not preferable in high temperature environments because of its low heat conductivity. In addition, as progressive cavity devices increase in diameter and/or length, the flow characteristics to maintain a successful and long-lasting bond of the rubber to the steel housing becomes more difficult. Also, where hydrocarbons make up the material to be pumped, such as in oil producing wells, rubber is known to deteriorate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The construction of the stator of the progressive cavity pump is a particular problem where highly abrasive material is required to be pumped. In certain circumstances, wastewater sludge must be pumped through the progressive cavity pump. Because of the high solids content of such sewage sludge, the stator can easily wear and require immediate replacement. Where conventional progressive cavity pumps are used having stators using buna-N and EPDM stators, the life of the stators is one week or less at maximum capacity. As such, a need has developed so as to create a stator having a long life. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide a stator for a progressive cavity pump having excellent wear resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the present invention to provide a stator for a progressive cavity pump that is able to withstand greatly elevated temperatures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It is a further object of the present invention to provide a stator for a progressive cavity pump that can withstand high pressures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> It is still a further object of the present invention to provide a stator for a progressive cavity pump which can be used in conjunction with the pumping of very abrasive compounds, such as sewage sludge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> It is still a further object of the present invention to provide a stator for a progressive cavity pump which has a very high tensile strength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> It is still a further object of the present invention to provide a stator for a progressive cavity pump which is relatively inexpensive, easy to produce and easy to install. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> These and other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from a reading of the attached specification and appended claims. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> progressive cavity pump <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> includes a rotor <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> turning within the stator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. In a typical configuration, the rotor <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is geometrically a large pitched helix, while the stator is a body with a two start helix with twice the pitch of a rotor. As a result, conveying spaces (cavities) are formed between the stator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the rotor <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> During pumping, these cavities are filled with product moving continuously from inlet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to outlet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. As a result of the smooth transition from one cavity to the next, the pump delivery is almost pulsation free. The conveying spaces are sealed by the interference between the rotor <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the stator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The stator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is held within a rigid shell <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The volume of the cavities during their advancement stays constant. The rotor <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> moves radially within the stator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Rotor <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is driven by way of drive shaft <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A and connecting shaft assembly <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>B. Drive shaft <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A is connected to a suitable power source such as an electric, hydraulic, pneumatic or other type of motor <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. To accommodate the orbital movement of rotor <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, connecting shaft assembly <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>B either comprises a shaft made of a flexible material, such as, a spring steel or comprises rigid shaft <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>C provided with joints <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>B at its ends, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Such joints may, for example, be gear, pin or universal joints. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Joints <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>B are provided with seals or elastomeric boots <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to prevent pumped material, e.g. sewage sludge, from entering the joints. Preferably, the joints are lubricated by a liquid, such as a lubricating oil. In such a case, the seals, boots or sleeves, in addition to keeping pumped material out of the joints, also keep the lubricant out of the pumped material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows an example of the stator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> as received within the interior of the shell <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The rotor <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is illustrated as positioned within the cavity <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the progressive cavity pump <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, it can be seen that the stator has wing areas <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> which are slidably received within channels formed in the rigid shell <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. As such, the stator can easily be removed from the interior of the shell by disconnecting a cap affixed to the end of the shell. Alternatively, various other mechanical connection techniques can be used so as to maintain the stator within the rigid shell <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. For example, the rigid shell <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> can be a two-part shell that is hingedly connected together so that the shell <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> can be separated and the stator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> easily removed. In another technique, mechanical fasteners can be affixed through the shell <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> so as to secure the stator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in its desired position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Importantly, in the present invention, the stator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is formed of a polyurethane material. The prior art uses of the stator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> have not shown the use of a polyurethane material. In particular, the polyurethane material which is used for the stator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> has a durometer hardness of between <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> shore. The particular polyurethane material that is used for the stator has an operating temperature of between 212&deg; F. and 400&deg; F. The polyurethane material used for the stator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> has a tensile strength of between 100 to 5100 p.s.i. Specifically, the polyurethane material for the stator is either a M-80-A-100-0600 elastomer or a M-50-d-100-1400 elastomer. The stator will have a diameter of between 2 inches and 10 inches, inclusive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a graph of tensile stress (p.s.i.) versus % elongation. The various lines A, B, C, D and E show the various material used for the stator for the present invention. A comparison between the prior art stator materials (shown by lines A, B and C) can be compared with the elastomers used for the stator for the present invention (shown by lines D and E). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Line A shows the use of neoprene at 65 shore A. It can be seen that neoprene can only withstand tensile stress of approximately 500 p.s.i. Line B represents natural rubber at 50 shore. The natural rubber, when used for the stator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, can only withstand tensile stress of approximately 500 p.s.i. A synthetic elastomer M-50-A-100-0200 shows a maximum tensile stress of 1,000 p.s.i. as represented by line C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The present invention in either of its preferred embodiments is shown by lines D and E. Line D represents the M-80-A-100-0600 elastomer. This elastomer, when used for the stator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, exhibits a tensile stress of approximately 2400 p.s.i. Finally, line E represents the M-50-d-100-1400 as used for the stator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. This material withstands a tensile stress of over 5,000 p.s.i. As can be seen in the graph of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the use of the polyurethane material, particularly the M-80-A-100-0600 and the M-50-d-100-1400 elastomers, exhibits significant improvements over the natural rubber and neoprene material as used on prior art stators. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> These elastomers, as used in the stator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the present invention, withstand temperatures of 250&deg; F. at pressures exceeding 500 p.s.i.g. These elastomers have excellent heat resistance along with better abrasive characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In an experiment with the present invention, these elastomers were formed into an eight inch stator. The stator was put into service at the Dane County Waste Water Facility. The previous stator life was 47 hours of operation using the EPDM material. By using the elastomer of the present invention, the life of the stator was extended to over 167 hours. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> These elastomers have higher oil and solvent resistance and better aging properties than general-purpose rubbers, such as Buna-N and EPDM. They have greater abrasion and tear resistance than neoprene or natural rubber, coupled with greater load-bearing capacity. Their extensibility and impact strength are greater than most plastics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> It has been found that the use of these elastomers in high wear environments, such as mud motors and progressive cavity pumps, when pumping dry lime, shows more than fourteen times the service life extension over stators of EPDM, Buna-N material and natural rubber. The M-80-A-100-0600 elastomer outlasted a stainless steel mesh by at least four hundred times the service life, at only seven times the actual cost. The stainless steel mesh screen lasted only ten days before requiring replacement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The present invention is particularly adapted for use in pumping sewage sludge. Experiments have shown that replacement of the prior art stator with the polyurethane stator of the present invention extended pump life of the stator from one week with the prior art stators to three weeks with the present invention. By avoiding replacement of the stator, the pump can have longer operating life, require less maintenance, and save replacement costs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The foregoing disclosure and description of the invention is illustrative and explanatory thereof. Various changes in the details of the illustrated construction may be made within the scope of the appended claims without departing from the true spirit of the invention. The present invention should only be limited by the following claims and their legal equivalents. </paragraph>
