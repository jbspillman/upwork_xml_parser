<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> There has been a desire on the part of appliance manufacturers to develop a one-piece door construction in appliances such as ranges and microwave ovens to reduce fabrication costs. Gaskets would have to be attached to such doors from an exterior side using some type of mechanical fastening. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> One approach for mechanically mounting such gaskets to one-piece doors has been disclosed in U.S. Pat. 4,822,060. That patent discloses providing a flexible, hollow cylindrical gasket with clip-type fasteners protruding along one side thereof. Such gaskets are formed from a hollow, tubular, knitted wire core and braided, glass fiber yarn outer jacket, somewhat similar to the cylindrical members of the old gasket assemblies. A single wire member is bent at several locations along its length to form a series of connected clip members and inserted through the core and jacket and generally captured. Other designs of the same assignee, Bentley-Harris, are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,205,075; 5,289,658; 5,341,601 and 5,395,126, all incorporated by reference herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,107,623 describes another type of gasket construction that includes an elongated core; a woven outer jacket surrounding the core and extending along the core; and a plurality of separate, individual fasteners spaced along the device. Each fastener has a base captured between the core and the woven outer jacket. Each fastener base is irremovably retained between portions of the core and the woven outer jacket adjoining one another and the base by the adjoining portions of the core and woven outer jacket. Each fastener further has an engagement portion extending away from the base and the adjoining portion of the core and through the adjoining portion of the woven outer jacket, protruding outwardly from the woven outer jacket. The individual fasteners are connected to one another in the device only through the capture of each fastener by the core and woven outer jacket. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Termination of either type of gasket is currently relatively unattractive. The ends of the gasket are simply brought together and overlapped in some fashion, either side by side or telescopically and fixed together with a suitable fastener such as a staple. Unless the appliance manufacturer can hide the joint thus formed in some way, for example, by covering it with part of a door panel, it will remain visible on the oven door where the exposed gasket end(s) will eventually begin to fray. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Referring to the drawings, wherein like numerals are employed for the indication of like elements throughout, there is shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a first preferred embodiment tubular gasket-type device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the essential components of the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> include an elongated core <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a woven outer jacket <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> surrounding the core <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a plurality of preferably separate, individual fasteners <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The core <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is preferably a continuous, elongated, seamless, flexible, tubular member with closed loop, normally circular transverse cross sectional shape, preferably knitted from a plurality of stainless steel or other spring tension wires <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in a conventional fashion. The core <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> has been extended from one end of the jacket <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for clarity. Woven outer jacket <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is also a continuous, elongated, seamless, flexible tubular member of normally circular cross sectional shape that closely surrounds and extends along the core <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Preferably the jacket <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is interwoven, preferably braided, from a multiplicity of glass fiber yam ends <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The spring wire core <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> keeps the less resilient jacket <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> from collapsing under compressive load. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of fasteners <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that are preferably separate, individual spring clip-type fasteners or &ldquo;clips&rdquo; and are preferably spaced at predetermined intervals along the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. One such clip <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is shown separately in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. As can be seen in that figure, the clip includes a base <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and an engagement portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> integral with the base <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and extending substantially perpendicularly from one side thereof. The base <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is substantially elongated between a pair of opposing ends <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> each of which is substantially rounded primarily to prevent cutting of the outer jacket <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The engagement portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of each clip includes a pair of adjoining, resiliently flexible spring arms <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, which can be compressed against one another to enable the arms <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to pass through an opening in a support member to which the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is attached. Arms <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> then return to their original, depicted configuration thereby securing the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the support member by an interference fit. As is best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, in this construction the base <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of each clip <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is captured between the core <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the outer jacket <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> with the engagement portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> extending transversely away from the base <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and protruding outwardly through the outer jacket <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> between the yarn ends. In particular, the base <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of each clip <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is irremovably retained between portions of the core <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and woven outer jacket <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which adjoin one another and the base <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> by the adjoining portions of the core <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and woven outer jacket <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Thus, the base <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of each clip <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> cannot be passed, for example through the core <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> into the hollow interior of the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or through the outer jacket <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> without partially severing or otherwise removing or damaging at least one of the adjoining portion of the core <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or jacket <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The basic device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> formed by the core <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, woven outer jacket <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and clip-type fasteners <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be used as a gasket in a conventional or self-cleaning oven door. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The subject invention enjoys several advantages over the existing art was represented by the Bentley Harris patents identified above. First, the engagement arms <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the clips <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> do not have to be of the same diameter or width as the base. Indeed, as is shown with respect to the clip <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the engagement arms <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are cut from the central portion of the base <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> which is much larger than either of the arms <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The enlarged base allows a greater area of the outer jacket <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to be trapped between the base <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the clip <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the member receiving the engagement portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the clip <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. This reduces the tendency of the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to roll around the engagement point and results in a more securely fastened device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The depicted clips <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be formed by stamping from a planar sheet of spring metal. Moreover, since a variety of clips or other types of fasteners can be employed, the configuration of the engagement portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and base <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be varied and the engagement force developed by the engagement portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> selected from a potentially wide range of attachment forces which can be achieved. The base <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> might be slightly longitudinally cambered as indicated to maintain the engagement portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> under tension when installed, thereby preventing movement between the clip <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the member receiving the clip. The base also can be cambered transversely or otherwise shaped in any desired way to optimize seating of the fastener against the gasket receiving oven door or other member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference> depict diagrammatically a presently preferred, separate, individual fastener in the form of a bent wire spring clip, indicated generally at <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The fastener <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is made from a single length of at least partially hardened wire <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. The wire <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is bent to define a generally planar base portion or &ldquo;base&rdquo; <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and a generally planar, generally diamond-shaped engagement portion or dart <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> projecting transversely from one major planar side <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> of the base <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The dart or engagement portion <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> is formed generally at the center of the length of wire <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> by bending the wire at three places (A, B, C) into the indicated generally diamond shape to form the pair of opposing side portions or &ldquo;sides&rdquo; or &ldquo;arms&rdquo; <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of dart <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. The free portions of the wire <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> are bent at C&prime; (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>) preferably to form an included angle greater than 130&deg; and are extended past one another, side by side, the crossing defining the end of the dart <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> proximal the base <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The remaining free end portions of the wire <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> are bent again (at D&prime; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>) generally in a plane perpendicular to the dart <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> so as to partially wrap about one another and to extend away from the dart <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> in opposing directions. The base <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is completed by curling the remaining free end portions of the wire <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> into separate loop portions <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>which preferably are circular closed loops. More particularly, the extreme opposing free ends or tips <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the wire <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> are each wrapped (counter clockwise in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>) under other respective portions of the wire <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> intermediate the ends <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the crossing, so as to overlap with such other intermediate portions and define opposing, completely closed portions <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the base <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. While each closed portion <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is preferably an at least generally circular closed loop as shown, other closed perimeter shapes could be used and formed in other ways. It is further noted that the shape of each half of the wire <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> extending away form the medial bend &ldquo;A&rdquo; is identical. As a result, the first portion <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is a reversed mirror image of the second portion <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the base <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> on opposing lateral sides of the central longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>&prime; of dart <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> when the base <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is viewed in plan as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. The preferred spring wire clip is described in greater detail in U.S. Pat. No. 5,806,149, which is incorporated by reference herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Fabrication of the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is straightforward. The preferred, knitted wire core <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is conventional, and its manufacture is known to those of ordinary skill in this art. Also, it is described at least to some extent in U.S. Pat. 3,578,764 incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. That patent discloses the beneficial uses of including a heat-resistant, flexible knitted metal wire core and a flexible, heat-resistant fabric jacket or cover, preferably of glass fibers, for use as an oven door gasket. Conventional elongated, tubular knitted wire members <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be obtained from such distributors as Montgomery Co., Windsor Locks, Conn. and ACS Industries, Woonsocket, R.I. A flexible knitted wire core <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for an oven door gasket might be made of 7 mil, full hard <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> stainless steel wire in a continuous jersey knit having 12 wales and 13&plusmn;1 courses/inch to form a continuous knit, cylindrically-shaped, hollow tube approximately &frac12; inch in diameter. The specification for a wire knitting machine to knit a hollow wire core like the core <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> would be &frac78; inch cylinder, 12 needles, 18 gauge, circular jersey knitting machine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The method of providing the braided outer jacket <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> capturing the base <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> of the clip fasteners <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> against the core <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is also straightforward. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> depicts diagrammatically significant portions of a conventional braiding machine <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> which includes a base <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> mounting a multiplicity of spindles <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Each spindle <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> receives a separate bobbin <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of yarn <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Only a few of the spindles <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and bobbins <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are depicted for clarity. The spindles <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and bobbins <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are driven along tracks (not depicted) in the base <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in a weaving, maypole fashion so as to braid a continuous tubular outer jacket <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> around the core <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Such braiding machines can be obtained from a variety of commercial sources including Wardwell Braiding Machine Company, Central Falls, R.I. and Braider Manufacturing Company, Kokubun, Inc., Nakajimacho, Hamainatsu, Japan. The typical specification for such a machine is a 72 carrier braider, No. 2 butt, 36&times;100 gear ratio with 24 inch capstan. The typical specification for such a braided jacket might be, for example, 72 ends of yarn (fiberglass) size-150&apos;s, 10 count, 20&plusmn;1 picks per inch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The core <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is fed through the center opening <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> in the base <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The machine <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> thereupon braids the yarn ends <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> into the outer jacket <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> extending around and along the length of the core <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Normally in such machines, the core <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> would be fed upward and the fasteners inserted upwardly between the ascending core <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a cone formed by the multiplicity of yarns <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> being laid over that core <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> until some portion of the base <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> of the clip <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is captured by the yarns <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and held against the core <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> To assist in positioning the clips <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> or other fasteners, the braider <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be modified in a known manner depicted diagrammatically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> to add a central reversing ring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> which enables the core <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to be fed vertically downward, rather than upward, through the machine <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The ring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is supported by a pair of arms <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> attached to a cross piece <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> fixedly supported in the central opening <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of the base <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. In this way, a funnel <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> formed by the yarns <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> converging on the core <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> tapers downwardly onto the core <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, permitting the clips <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> or other individual fasteners to be inserted downwardly among the converging yarns <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> from above, as depicted. This simplifies, to some extent, the feeding and positioning of the individual fasteners. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the clips <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> or other individual fasteners are inserted automatically by a suitably configured inserting mechanism. The mechanism might include, for example, a vibratory bowl having a vibrating reservoir at one end for orienting and feeding the clips <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to the mouth of a stationary chute. The chute can extend from the vibrating reservoir towards the reversing ring of the braider and terminate at a point close to where the braided funnel <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of glass fiber yarns contacts the core <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. An escapement, for example, may be provided to release one clip at a time down the chute. The clip <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is held at the lower end of the chute with the base portion of the clip contacting or nearly contacting the core and the engagement portion of the clip nearly contacting the individual yams tapering together in the funnel <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. The clip at the end of the chute can thereafter be pushed between the converging core and yarns <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> forming the descending funnel <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> by suitable means, such as a solenoid-operated plunger which is timed for operation of the braider and/or the core feeder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> After braiding, the glass fiber outer jacket <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be heat treated and/or colored, if desired, in a conventional fashion. However, the devices <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can also be treated as follows. Individual yams <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of outer jacket <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be coated, preferably at an individual yarn level, with a polymeric material in the form of a silicone resin coating to provide color to the outer jacket <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The silicone resin coating is preferably one which resists temperatures up to at least 800&deg; F. (about 427&deg; C.), without color change or other adverse deterioration including loss of adhesion, for use with self cleaning electric ovens. One suggested coating is Dow Corning&reg; 1-0469 waterborne resin, which is an anionic emulsion of a medium-hard phenylmethyl silicone resin. Alternatively, Dow Corning&reg; 1-0468 waterborne resin, which is an anionic emulsion of a soft phenylmethyl silicone resin and which resists temperatures to about 1,200&deg; F. (560&deg; C.), can be used where higher temperature resistance is required or desired. The particle size of the resins in these emulsions is less than 700 nanometers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the silicone resin coating is applied as a water based emulsion containing resin solids. The emulsion is formed using conventional equipment normally used for preparing latex coatings and paints. The emulsions identified above are supplied at a concentration of about sixty percent by weight of resin solids. It is suggested that this concentration be reduced to about five percent or less of resin solids by the addition of water. One quart of supplied emulsion (sixty percent solids) is suggestedly added to five gallons of water to provide about a three percent by weight concentration of resin solids in the emulsion. This not only reduces initial material costs, it further reduces the loss due to burn-off, which typically occurs when the resin solids are heated above 300&deg; F. To adhere the resin to the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is coated with the silicone resin emulsion, preferably by being immersed in the silicone resin emulsion. If the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is fabricated in continuous lengths, the lengths can be continuously passed through a trough or other appropriate reservoir to coat the outer jacket. Alternatively, any other method of applying a liquid coating, including brushing, rolling, spraying, etc., can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> After initially coating, the liquid portion of the emulsion on the outer jacket is driven off, suggestedly by drying at a maximum temperature below that at which burn off occurs, typically less than about 300&deg; F., and then heat curing at a minimum temperature at which at least partial burn off does occur, typically above 300&deg; F. Burn off is characterized by smoke being generated. It is further believed at these temperatures that at least some of the silicone resin is converted to silicon, which bonds to the glass. More specifically, the coating <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is suggestedly first dried at room temperature to the point where the coating does not rub off by ordinary handling. The remaining emulsion coat the individual yams. It then is heat cured for approximately thirty minutes or more at approximately 450&deg; F. (232&deg; C.) to achieve at least partial bum off. Where being installed in self-cleaning ovens, the final part or all of the heat curing step can be performed by the ultimate purchaser when first using the oven in the self-cleaning mode. The cured silicone resin provides a permanent solid coating affixed to the individual yarns <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> forming the outer layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The coating <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is provided in this way in an amount which is insufficient to obscure the individual yams of the outer jacket <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> from one another, thus allowing the observer to still discern the individual yarns in the braid or other weave used. The coating <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is also flexible to flex with the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> during use as an oven gasket but provides a set to the gasket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to minimize fraying of the glass fiber yarns at the free ends of the gasket. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Gray to black color can easily be added to the coating <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> by the addition of graphite in varying concentrations to the diluted emulsion. For example for the quart of resin concentrate in five gallons of water (1 to 20 ratio), sixty grams of added graphite solids will impart a light gray to silvery color to the coating and the outer jacket <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Suggestedly, a colloidal graphite suspended in water can be used. The addition of six hundred grams graphite (solids) imparts a very dark gray to black color to the coating and outer jacket <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Different shades of gray in between can be achieved by intermediate concentrations of graphite. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> depicts yet another form of construction. Gasket device <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> includes an inner core <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and woven outer jacket <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in which a plurality of individual fasteners <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> are first secured to a strip <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> by passing free ends of the fasteners <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> forming their bases through pairs of holes <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> in the strip. The strip is then inserted into the hollow tubular core <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and jacket <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the engagement portions or darts <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight> of the fasteners pushed through the interwoven ends forming the inner core <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and outer woven jacket <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In addition, the continuous bent wire form <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and the individual clips <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>, other fasteners can be used with a single hollow tubular member interwoven (i.e., braided or knitted) from a mixture of glass fiber yam ends and wire ends in the manner disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,395,126, also incorporated by reference herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> depicts the improvement of the present invention in which the free ends <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, or similar free ends of devices <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, etc. or any other similar elongated seamless flexible tubular gasket member, are coupled together at a joint indicated in phantom generally at <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and secured together by suitable means such as a staple <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> or other fastener or fastening to form a closed loop oven gasket. The ends <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>may be telescoped or overlapped as indicated or butted together. The core <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be removed from one of the ends <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to permit the outer jacket of that end to be compressed and telescoped into the core and jacket at the other end. Also, the core may be removed from both ends of the outer jacket to telescope or overlap or the ends may simply be overlapped and compressed and held in compression by the staple or other fastening. According to the invention, a second tubular member <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is positioned over the joint <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> so as to cover the joint and joined ends <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The second tubular member <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> may mount at least one separate fastener <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (or <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>, etc.) having a base <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> located between the elongated tubular member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the second tubular member <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and an engagement portion <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, which can be seen, extending outwardly through the second tubular member <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and away from the elongated tubular member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. This construction permits a relatively short length second tubular member to be slipped over one of the two free ends <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>before the joint <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is made and then slipped around the joint <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> after the free ends are joined together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> formed into a closed loop with second tubular member <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is mounted in a conventional fashion to an oven door <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> with the engagement portion <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of each fastener including any fasteners provided on the second tubular member <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> mating with holes <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> or other engagement mating positions provided in the door <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. The use of the other disclosed devices <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, etc. with second tubular member <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> would be in a conventional fashion by inserting the clips <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (or <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, etc.) or other provided fasteners into holes <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> or other suitable receptacles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Also or in the alternative to using fasteners on the second tubular member, the second tubular member <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> can be cut to a length sufficient to extend between the two clips <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&prime; and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&Prime; projecting from the tubular member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> immediately adjoining the joint <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>) and trapped by the two clips <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&Prime; so as to always span the joint <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> no matter where the second tubular member <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is positioned between the two clips <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&Prime; (or other fasteners). Preferably, the joint <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is generally centrally located between two clips that immediately adjoin the joint <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> on either side of the joint <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> so that the tubular member <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> needs to have a length only slightly greater than the length of one of the free ends it is slipped over before the joint is made. The second tubular member would be slightly longitudinally compressed to expose the free end of the tubular member on which it is slipped to make the joint. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Glass fiber second tubular members <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> can be cut from continuous lengths of tubing if used without their own fasteners or made in the same way as devices <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> if used with fasteners. The hollow inner core <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> would be pulled from the devices <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> after fabrication. Alternatively, the fasteners may be fabricated directly into a woven member (e.g. <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>) through which the fastener extends in the same way that fasteners <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> are fabricated into outer jacket <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. After fabrication and silicone treatment, if desired, the second tubular members can be cut to length. Second tubular members <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> can also be made from other materials having sufficiently high temperature resistance. For example, second tubular members might be made from thin metal tubing <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> with corrugations <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> along some of their lengths as indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> or along all of their lengths. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that devices of the subject invention can be provided in a wide variety of sizes. While knitted wire is preferred as the core material for strength, flexibility, light weight and temperature resistance, other type of hollow and solid cores and core materials can be used. Glass fiber yarn is similarly preferred as the outer jacket material for low cost, high temperature capacity and density which permits a substantially air tight jacket to be made. Other flexible, inorganic materials with sufficient high temperature capacity to function in ovens, particularly self-cleaning oven applications could be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> While various embodiments of the invention have been disclosed, and modifications thereto suggested it will be recognized by those skilled in the art that changes could be made to the above-described embodiments without departing from the broad, inventive concept thereof. It is understood, therefore, that this invention is not limited to the particular embodiments disclosed, but is intended to cover any modifications which are within the scope and spirit of the invention, as defined by the appended claims. </paragraph>
