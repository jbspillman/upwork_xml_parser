<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A vehicle closure has a power operated vehicle compartment latch that includes a fork bolt, a detent lever having a release tab and a stop tab, and an eccentric post on an electric motor driven wheel. The detent lever is driven to a release position by the motor via the post and the release tab to unlatch the vehicle closure. The post engages the stop tab to stall the electric motor after the detent is driven to the release position which allows the fork bolt to move to an open or unlatch position. The stop tab is disabled when the fork bolt is moved to the latch position. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a vehicle compartment latch and more particularly to a power operated compartment latch for latching a vehicle compartment closure, such as a trunk deck lid or a cargo lift gate, in the closed position to secure the vehicle compartment. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Passenger vehicles are normally equipped with a rear vehicle compartment for storing a spare tire and transporting items such as groceries and luggage. A conventional passenger vehicle has a trunk that is closed by a deck lid that is hinged to the vehicle body and swings open to provide access to the trunk. On the other hand, a passenger van has a rear cargo compartment that is closed by a lift gate. The deck lid or lift gate is usually equipped with a compartment latch that cooperates with a striker attached to the vehicle body to latch the closure (e.g. deck lid or lift gate) in the closed position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In order to open the vehicle closure, the compartment latch must be unlatched or opened. Nearly all installations include a key lock cylinder or some other means for unlatching the compartment latch manually. However, power operated compartment latches that can be unlatched electrically by a switch inside the passenger compartment or by a key fob are becoming very popular. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In the past, power operated compartment latches have required either a reversible electric motor or a massive return spring to restore the compartment latch to an open position after a power unlatching operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 6,076,868 granted to Lloyd Rogers Jr., et al Jun. 20, 2000 discloses an improved power operated vehicle compartment latch that does not require either a reversible electric motor or a massive return spring. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> This invention provides a still further improved power operated vehicle compartment latch that does not require either a reversible electric motor or a massive return spring to restore the compartment latch to an open position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The power operated vehicle compartment latch has a support that is adapted for fastening to a closure, a fork bolt that moves between an open position and a closed position, and a detent lever that moves between a detent position and a release position. The detent lever retains the fork bolt in the closed position when in the detent position and releases the fork bolt for return to the open position when in the release position. The detent lever has a release tab and a stop tab. A power unit that is mounted on the support, rotates a wheel that carries an eccentric post that moves in a circular path as the wheel rotates. When the power unit is activated, the eccentric post engages and moves the release tab moving the detent lever to the release position so that the fork bolt can move to the open position. After the detent lever is moved to the release position, the eccentric post engages the stop tab to deactivate the power unit. The stop tab is disabled when the fork bolt and detent lever are moved to the respective closed and detent positions. The vehicle compartment latch is now set for power unlatching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The power operated vehicle compartment latch is preferably powered by a unidirectional electric motor that is preferably shut off by stalling the electric motor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The fork bolt and detent lever of the power operated vehicle compartment latch are preferably biased to respective latched and detent positions by a single spring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> These and other features, objects and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following description of a preferred embodiment taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawing. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Vehicle compartment latch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a housing or support <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that is adapted for fastening to a vehicle compartment closure, such as a trunk compartment deck lid <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and a fork bolt <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> that pivots on support <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> about pivot pin <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> between an open or unlatched position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and a closed or latched position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Vehicle compartment latch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is attached to deck lid <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> so that fork bolt <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is moved from the open position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> to the closed position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> when deck lid <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is closed and fork bolt <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> engages a striker <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that is attached to the vehicle body <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> at the deck lid opening. The cooperation of a fork bolt and striker is well known and need not be described in detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Vehicle compartment latch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> further comprises a detent lever <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> that pivots on support <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> about pivot pin <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and cooperates with fork bolt <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in a well known manner to retain fork bolt <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in the closed position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> or release the fork bolt <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for return to the open position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. That is, detent lever <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> pivots between a detent position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and a release position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Fork bolt <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is spring biased clockwise to the open position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> by coil spring <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> that has one end attached to fork bolt <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the other end attached to detent lever <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Thus coil spring <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> also spring biases detent lever <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> counterclockwise against face <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of fork bolt <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and toward the detent position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> where detent lever <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> engages latch shoulder <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of fork bolt <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Detent lever <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> includes a release tab <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and a stop tab <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> that project rearwardly, that is into the plane of the paper as viewed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. Release tab <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and stop tab <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> control the movements of detent lever <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> by a power unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> as explained below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Power unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> includes a unidirectional electric motor <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> mounted on support <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that drives a worm gear (not shown) that in turn drives a gear wheel <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> that rotates on pivot pin <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of support <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Gear wheel <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> carries an eccentric post <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> that moves in a concentric circular path as gear wheel <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> rotates on support <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Post <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> cooperates with release tab <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and stop tab <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> as explained below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Vehicle compartment latch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> operates in the following manner. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows deck lid <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> open with fork bolt <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in the open or unlatched position and detent lever <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in the release position. Post <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> engages stop tab <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. When deck lid <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is closed, fork bolt <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> engages striker <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and fork bolt <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is pivoted counterclockwise by the closing deck lid <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> from the open or unlatched position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> to the closed or latched position trapping striker <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the compartment latch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. As forkbolt <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> pivots to the closed position face <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of fork bolt <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> rides along ramp <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of detent lever <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. When fork bolt <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> reaches the latched position of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, detent lever <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is pivoted counterclockwise by coil spring <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> moving catch surface <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> into engagement with latch shoulder <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. When detent lever <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> pivots to the latched position of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, stop tab <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is moved out of the circular path of travel of post <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. Post <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, however, remains in position A shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. Vehicle compartment latch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is now ready for a power release by power unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Vehicle compartment latch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is power released by energizing electric motor <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> which turns gear wheel <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> clockwise so that post <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> travels clockwise in a concentric circular path about pivot pin <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> from position A shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> to position B by-passing stop tab <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and into engagement with release tab <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. As gear wheel <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> continues turning, post <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> pushes release tab <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> in a clockwise direction pivoting detent lever <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> clockwise to the release position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> where stop tab <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is moved into the circular path of travel of post <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. Fork bolt <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is now free to rotate clockwise and deck lid <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is opened a given amount by the bias of coil spring <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the pressure of the deck lid seal (not shown). These opening forces open deck lid <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> enough to withdraw striker <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> so that fork bolt <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> pivots clockwise back to the open or unlatched position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> under the bias of coil spring <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. As fork bolt <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> rotates clockwise to the open position of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> face <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> slides along ramp <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to hold detent lever <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in the release position which moves stop tab <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> back into the circular path of movement of post <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. In the meantime, post <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> continues to travel with gear wheel <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> past release tab <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and back around to position A engaging stop tab <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and stalling electric motor <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The parts are now in the open or unlatched position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and the vehicle compartment latch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is ready for latching engagement with striker <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> when deck lid <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is closed as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> While the compartment latch of our invention has been described in connection with deck lid <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the compartment latch can be used with other compartment closures such as a van lift gate. In other words, many modifications and variations of the present invention in light of the above teachings may be made. It is, therefore, to be understood that, within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described. </paragraph>
