<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> Fly tying vises are not new per se. Typical of the prior art fly tying vises to which the present invention relates are those shown in the prior Renzetti U.S. patents listed below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> a) Renzetti U.S. Pat. No. 4,169,562 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> b) Renzetti U.S. Pat. No. 5,169,079 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> These vises typically comprise a base and an upstanding adjustable height beam extending up from the base, a rotary shaft mounted at the upper end of the height beam which has an offset portion mounting a jaw assembly for supporting a hook positioning the shank portion of the hook coaxial with the rotational axis of rotary shaft thereby permitting the creation of a precision fly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In the Renzetti &apos;079 patent, the tips of the jaw assemblies are normally biased to an open position by spring means and can be adjusted to grip a fish hook by a rotatable cam element having continuously tapered planar surfaces which mate and confront complementary planar cam follower surfaces on the jaws opposite the tip ends to provide a surface to surface contact between the cam surfaces and the follower surfaces on the jaws. By this arrangement, the spread or distance between the tips of the jaws may be selectively adjusted between an open position spaced apart an adequate distance to permit insertion of a hook and a closed, locked position by rotating the cam to close the jaws to firmly grip the hook for the fly tying operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Even though the Renzetti &apos;079 patent shows a system which functions well for the purposes intended, the precision required to make the inter-engaging cam surfaces and the jaw follower surfaces are rather costly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> With the foregoing in mind, it is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a fly tying vise generally similar to that described in the Renzetti &apos;097 patent having an improved system for adjusting the distance between the tips of the jaws which is considerably more economical to make. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> With this in mind, in accordance with the present invention, the inner end of each of the jaws is provided with a spherical projection which provides a line contact with the planar rotary cam surfaces. In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, the confronting faces of the terminal ends of the jaws are provided with pockets for spherical rolling elements which function as cam followers and engage the planar surfaces of the rotatable cam element. It has been found that this arrangement is much more economical to machine. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the drawings and particularly <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> thereof, there is shown a fly tying device incorporating the present invention which is generally designated by the numeral <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The basic elements of the device are not new per se. However, the present invention is directed to the particular configuration of the jaws for holding a fishhook in the device during a fly tying procedure and specifically to a new and improved cam follower arrangement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Thus, the device includes a base <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which can be mounted to a table top or the like <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> so that the fly tying vise is stable during a fly tying procedure. The base <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> includes an upstanding vertical support <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> having an opening <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> for an adjustable height beam <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> supported in the base by a clamp screw <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> which allows for disassembly of the base and beam <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to store the fly tying device when not in use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> A thread cradle <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is mounted on the beam <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for vertical adjusting movement thereon by means of a mounting block <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and clamp screw <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The cradle <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is adjustable for selectively positioning the location of the hanger <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> relative to the fishhook in the manner shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. A support head <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is mounted on the upper end of the beam <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. A shaft <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> rotatable about its longitudinal axis is coupled to clutch means <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> for rotating the shaft in one direction about the longitudinal axis A-A. As shown, the shaft <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and clutch means <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> mounted on the adjustable height beam <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The shaft <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> has a downwardly extending portion <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> disposed at an angle to the longitudinal axis A-A of the shaft. A hook clamping means broadly designated by the numeral <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is mounted at the end of the angularly extending shaft portion <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The clamping means includes a pair of hook engaging jaws <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, when a fishhook H<highlight><subscript>f </subscript></highlight>is held in the clamping jaws <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> at the outer terminal end of the shaft extension, the hook is supported so that the shaft or fishhook is in alignment with the axis A-A. In this position, rotation of the handle in the direction shown by the arrow causes the fishhook to rotate about the axis A-A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> There is shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> inclusive a first embodiment of jaw assembly in accordance with the present invention. As illustrated therein, the jaws <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are of elongated generally rectangular shape having pointed tips <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> at one end which are adapted to clampingly engage the fishhook H<highlight><subscript>f </subscript></highlight>in the manner shown in the drawings. The rear terminal confronting inner faces of the jaws <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are undercut as at <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to define a shelf. The undercut portions have aligned openings <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> for mounting the stub shafts <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of a cam-handle actuator assembly <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> having a handle <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> connected to the periphery of a disc-like cam <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. The jaws are normally held in a closed position by an adjustable clamping screw <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> which engages through an opening <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> adjacent the tip portion of the jaws and threads into a tapped opening <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> in the opposing jaw member. A spring <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> normally biases the tips to an open position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In the present instance, cam followers <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> in the shape of confronting semi-cylindrical protrusions <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> formed on the confronting inner faces of the undercut in the jaw members. These cam surfaces <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> engage the planar cam faces of the cam elements during actuation and provide a line contact when spreading or contracting the jaw tips depending on which way the handle is rotated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> An elastic collar <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> in the form of a rubber O-ring normally maintains the jaws and cam followers on the cam surface during adjusting movement of the handle to open or close the tips of the jaws in a manner described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The clamping jaws are relatively easy to operate to position a hook in the tips <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the jaws <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. This is simply done by initially rotating the handle <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> in a direction to open the jaws for a given hook size. The user then positions the hook H<highlight><subscript>f </subscript></highlight>in the bite of the jaws and then rotates the handle <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> in a clockwise direction to press the tips <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> firmly against the hook H<highlight><subscript>f </subscript></highlight>and support it in the manner shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> There is shown FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, another embodiment of clamping jaw assembly and in accordance with the present invention. The jaw and cam arrangement are generally similar to the above-described embodiment and therefore like parts have the same reference numerals with an &ldquo;a&rdquo; subscript added. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The jaw assembly includes a pair of jaws <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>a</subscript></highlight>,<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>a </subscript></highlight>of elongated generally rectangular shape having pointed tips <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>a </subscript></highlight>which clampingly engage the fishhook H<highlight><subscript>f </subscript></highlight>in the manner shown in the drawings. The rear terminal confronting interfaces of the jaws are undercut as at <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>a </subscript></highlight>to define a shelf. These undercut portions have confronting opposing circular openings to receive the stub shaft of a cam element <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>a</subscript></highlight>. The jaws are normally held in a closed position by an adjustable clamping screw <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>a </subscript></highlight>which engages through an opening <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>a </subscript></highlight>adjacent the tip portions of the jaws and threads into a tapped opening in the complementary jaw. A spring normally biases the tips to an open position. Confronting circular pockets <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> are provided in the undercut terminal end portions of the jaws for seating a spherical ball <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> which is normally positioned to engage the cam surface <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>a </subscript></highlight>in the manner shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> when the parts are assembled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Even though particular embodiments of the present invention have been illustrated and described herein, it is not intended to limit the invention and changes and modifications may be made therein within the scope of the following claims. </paragraph>
