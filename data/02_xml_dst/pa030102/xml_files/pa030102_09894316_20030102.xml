<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The field of art to which this invention relates is medical devices, more specifically, medical devices and surgical procedures for performing anastomosis of hollow organs such as blood vessels. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Anastomosis surgical procedures are common in the field of cardiac surgery. These procedures are conventionally used for repairing a damaged or diseased blood vessel. In a typical anastomosis procedure, a surgeon joins a first blood vessel to a second blood vessel and creates a passageway between the two blood vessels to provide for the communication of blood flow. For this kind of anastomosis, the surgeon typically uses specialized grasping tools to manipulate a tiny, curved needle attached to an extremely fine surgical filament (e.g., under 0.001 inch diameter) to suture the vessels together. The vessels may be joined conventionally as end-to-end, end-to-side, or side-to-side anastomoses. To facilitate healing of the joined vessels, the prevailing standard of care requires that the surgeon suture the inside surfaces of the first and second vessels together, intima to intima. The surgeon must take great care not to damage the intima of each vessel so that endothelial cells may form over the anastomosis without the formation of thrombus or other complications, thus improving the likelihood of a long term patency of the vessels. For life-saving procedures such as coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG), this is especially important. When performing a distal anastomosis in a conventional CABG procedure, the surgeon typically sutures an end-to-side anastomosis of a distal end of a graft vessel (such as, for example, a segment of saphenous vein harvested from the patient) to a side of a target vessel (e.g., the stenosed coronary artery). For a proximal anastomosis in a conventional CABG procedure, the surgeon sutures a proximal end of the graft vessel to the side of the aorta. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> As this field of art has progressed, new anastomotic methods have been developed and introduced in attempts to replace the suturing technique briefly described above. Many of these methods incorporate novel fasteners and fastener appliers. The requirement, however, to maintain intima-to-intima contact of the joined vessels remains just as important with these approaches. In fact it is often necessary, prior to joining the vessels, for the surgeon to evert (i.e., turn inside out) the end of at least one of the vessels over the end of a member such as a tube, ferrule, or bushing, etc., which is a component of the fastener or fastener applier. This exposes the intima of that vessel for presentation to the intima of the other vessel prior to fastening the vessels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Although it is possible to evert larger vessels (over 5 mm in diameter) using standard forceps and graspers available in the operating room, such methods are slow and may result in excessive damage to the vessel everted. And, often the surgeon requires assistance in performing the eversion procedure. Furthermore, vessels smaller than 5 mm are very difficult, if not impossible, to evert using such methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> There are several requirements for an effective vessel eversion device. As noted earlier, for proper healing, it is important not to injure the intima of either vessel during the eversion procedure. The eversion device also must be easy for the surgeon to use without assistance and require only a few steps to operate. The eversion device must be useful for a wide range of blood vessel sizes, particularly small vessels, e.g., having a diameter of about 2-3 mm or less. In addition, it is desirable for the eversion device to be useful on one end of a vessel, when the opposite end is already attached to the patient (e.g., at the distal anastomosis of a patient undergoing a CABG procedure). The eversion device should also allow for the proper length of everted tissue over the tube, bushing, or the like, depending on the requirements of the anastomosis device/method to be used. Finally, it is desirable that the eversion device be low cost and yet operate reliably. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, there is a need in this art for novel devices and methods for engaging and everting the end of a blood vessel (or other tubular body organ) over a member such as a tube, ferrule, bushing, or the like which can be used in a quick and effective manner without causing trauma to the vessel or the intima of the vessel (or tubular body organ). </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide novel eversion devices which are easy for the surgeon to use without assistance, and which efficiently and effectively engage blood vessels and evert the ends of blood vessels, including blood vessels having small or fine diameters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A further object of the present invention is to provide novel eversion devices which engage blood vessels and evert the ends of blood vessels without causing trauma to the blood vessel or the intima of the blood vessels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It is yet another object of the present invention to provide novel methods of engaging and everting blood vessels quickly and efficiently, while preventing or minimizing damage to the blood vessels and the intimas of the blood vessels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It is still yet a further object of the present invention to provide a novel vessel eversion device and procedure for everting one end of a vessel having the other end already attached to another vessel. Accordingly, an eversion instrument for everting an end of a vessel is disclosed. The instrument has a tubular body member having an axial bore, a distal end and a proximal end. The proximal end has an opening in communication with the axial bore and the distal end has an opening in communication with the axial bore. A piston is slideably contained within the axial bore. The piston has a distal end, a proximal end, and an axial passage. There is a plunger rod member having a distal end and a proximal end. At least a proximal section of the rod member is slideably mounted within the axial passage of the piston and is axially movable between an extended position and a retracted position. A distal end section of the plunger rod extends distally out through the distal opening of the tubular body member. A spring is mounted to the rod member for biasing the plunger with respect to and the piston. The instrument has a plurality of flexible filaments. Each filament has a distal end attached to the distal end of the plunger rod and a proximal end attached to the piston. Each of the filaments is tensioned by the spring biasing the plunger rod with respect to the piston. A plurality of guides circumferentially spaced apart are located at the distal end of the tubular body member. Each guide has a passage for receiving and supporting one or more of the filaments radially apart from the plunger rod. In operation, a distal end section of the plunger and distal end sections of the filaments are insertable into a lumen of a vessel when the plunger rod is in the extended position to evert the end of a vessel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the present invention is a method of everting the end of a vessel. An eversion instrument is provided. The instrument has a tubular body member having an axial bore, a distal end and a proximal end. The proximal end has an opening in communication with the axial bore and the distal end has an opening in communication with the axial bore. A piston is slideably contained within the axial bore. The piston has a distal end, a proximal end, and an axial passage. There is a plunger rod member having a distal end and a proximal end. At least a proximal section of the rod member is slideably mounted within the axial passage of the piston and is axially movable between an extended position and a retracted position. A distal end section of the plunger rod extends distally out through the distal opening of the tubular body member. A spring is mounted to the rod member for biasing the plunger with respect to and the piston. The instrument has a plurality of flexible filaments. Each filament has a distal end attached to the distal end of the plunger rod and a proximal end attached to the piston. Each of the filaments is tensioned by the spring biasing the plunger rod with respect to the piston. A plurality of guides circumferentially spaced apart are located at the distal end of the tubular body member. Each guide has a passage for receiving and supporting one or more of the filaments radially apart from the plunger rod. A distal end section of the plunger and distal end sections of the filaments are insertable into a lumen of a vessel when the plunger rod is in the extended position. A tubular workpiece is provided. The tubular workpiece has a tubular member having an axial passage, a distal opening and a proximal opening both of which communicate with the axial passage. The tubular member also has an outer surface, a proximal end, and a distal end. Next, a vessel having a lumen is inserted into the axial passage of the tubular member such that an end section of the vessel extends out from the distal end of the tubular member. The distal end section of the plunger and the distal end sections of the filaments are inserted into the lumen of the vessel. The end section of the vessel is then invaginated over the distal end of the distal end of the tubular member onto its outer surface. Then, the end section of the plunger and the distal end sections of the filaments are withdrawn from the lumen of the end section of the vessel. The eversion is completed by withdrawing the everted vessel out from the tubular member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Yet another aspect of the present invention is the combination of the above-described eversion instrument of the present invention and a tubular workpiece. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> These and other aspects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following description and accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates a preferred embodiment of an eversion instrument <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention. The instrument <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is used for everting a vessel end section <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) of a vessel <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> over the end of a tube <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, also referred to as a tubular workpiece <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. Vessel <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be a blood vessel, such as a segment of the greater saphenous vein, having a diameter of about 2-8 mm, although other hollow organs having approximately the same size may be everted using eversion instrument <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Tube <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> holds vessel <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and is representative of numerous kinds of bushings, ferrules, tubes, and specialized devices having an approximately cylindrical shape with an axial bore through it. The tube <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is seen to have interior surface <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and exterior surface <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. Vessel <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> inserts into an axial bore or lumen <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> of tube <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> so that a vessel section <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of vessel <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> extends beyond a tube end <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> of tube <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. The vessel <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is seen to have lumen <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, interior surface <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> and exterior surface <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. The length of vessel section <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of vessel <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> depends primarily on the desired length of eversion, but is approximately in the range of 5-15 mm. The operator of eversion instrument <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, an assistant, or a mechanical holding device holds tube <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> as the operator uses eversion instrument <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to evert vessel section <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> onto tube <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, eversion instrument <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a cylinder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> containing a piston <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, a mandrel <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> coaxially mounted to piston <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and extending from cylinder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and a plurality of flexible filaments <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> attached to mandrel <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and passing into cylinder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Piston <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, cylinder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and mandrel <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are preferably made of a rigid plastic suitable for contact with vessel <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, although other biocompatible materials may be used including surgical grade stainless steel, glass, etc. Filaments <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> are preferably made from any sterile, non-metallic materials currently used for surgical sutures, including polyester braided suture, polypropylene suture, and catgut. Although, if desired, but not preferred, filaments <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> may be constructed from flexible biocompatible metals. The number of filaments may vary, and is sufficient to provide effective eversion, and is preferably in the range of 8-12 filaments. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional side view of eversion instrument <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown in alignment for insertion into lumen <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> of vessel <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, which is shown held in lumen <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> of tube <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. Cylinder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes a distal end <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, a proximal end <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and an axial bore <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Piston <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> includes a distal end <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, a proximal end <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, and an axial bore <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. Piston <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> inserts slideably into axial bore <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of cylinder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Mandrel <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is an elongated, rigid rod or tube having a distal end <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, a proximal end <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, and a ring <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> attached approximately halfway between distal end <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and proximal end <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. Proximal end <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of mandrel <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> inserts slideably into axial bore <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of piston <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. A spring <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, preferably a coiled, stainless steel wire, compression spring, mounts loosely over mandrel <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> between ring <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and distal end <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of piston <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, providing a light, biasing force to mandrel <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in the distal (left, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) direction. Each one of filaments <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> attaches to distal tip <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of mandrel <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Cylinder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes a flange <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> on distal end <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and projecting into axial bore <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Flange <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of guide holes <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Each one of filaments <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> passes through one of guide holes <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and attaches at one of a plurality of terminations on distal end <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of piston <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, filaments <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> transcribe a conical array about the longitudinal axis of cylinder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and extend from distal end <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of cylinder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Tension in each of filaments <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is maintained by the biasing force provided by spring <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> depict the steps of the operational sequence for using eversion instrument <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Referring initially to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, there is illustrated a first step of inserting mandrel <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> into lumen <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> of vessel <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, which is held in tube <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. The operator holds cylinder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> between the thumb and second finger, while pressing lightly on proximal end <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of piston <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> with the index finger in order to slacken filaments <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> during insertion. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows eversion instrument <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> being used in a second step of flaring end section <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of vessel <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The operator removes pressure applied to distal end <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of piston <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> while still holding cylinder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> so that filaments <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> tension into the conical array about mandrel <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows eversion instrument <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> being used in a third step of invaginating end <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of vessel <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The operator moves cylinder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the distal (left) direction, allowing piston <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to extend out of the proximal end <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of cylinder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Mandrel <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> retracts out of vessel <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> slightly. Filaments <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> remain lightly tensioned due to the biasing force provided by spring <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. Maintaining this tension helps to flare and invaginate end section <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of vessel <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, thus facilitating the eversion of end section <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of vessel <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> over end <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> of tube <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows eversion instrument <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> being used in a fourth step of completing the eversion of end section <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> of vessel <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> over tube <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> by moving distal end <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of cylinder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> over tube <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, so that filaments <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> pull end section <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> of vessel <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> over end <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> of tube <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, and further such that exterior surface <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> of vessel <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is in contact with or proximate exterior surface <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> of end section <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>.

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> A patient undergoing cardiac coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery is prepared for surgery and anesthetized in a conventional manner in accordance with the prevailing medical standards. The patient&apos;s chest is opened in a conventional manner by cutting through the sternum and expanding the rib cage with a conventional surgical retractor instrument. The patient&apos;s heart is accessed in a conventional manner and the patient is connected to a pulmonary bypass machine and the heart is stopped. A section of the patient&apos;s saphenous vein, which has already been harvested by this time, is prepared for use as a graft vessel. The graft vessel end that is to be attached to the aorta for the proximal anastomosis is everted using an eversion instrument of the present invention as already described in the detailed description and shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, vessel <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is shown everted over tube <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. One embodiment of tube <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is disclosed in published patent application WO0056228, &ldquo;Low Profile Anastomosis Connector&rdquo;, filed on Mar. 20, 2000, assigned to By-Pass, Inc., and which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. As described in WO0056228, a metallic anastomosis connector comprising a plurality of ring segments is used to fasten the graft vessel to another vessel such as the aorta. The distal end of the graft vessel is then be anastomotically attached to a coronary artery on the heart using a conventional hand suturing method. Additional bypasses are performed in the same manner or variations, depending on the patient&apos;s condition and anatomy. The remainder of the CABG procedure is conducted in a conventional manner and includes the steps of inspecting and repairing the grafts for leaks, checking blood flow, removing the patient from the pulmonary bypass machine, and closing the surgical incision. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The eversion instruments and eversion methods of the present invention have many advantages. The present invention is less traumatic to the intima of the vessel during the eversion procedure than conventional surgical graspers and the like. The present invention is easy for the surgeon to use without assistance and requires only a few steps to operate. The present invention is useful for a wide range of blood vessel sizes, particularly small vessels, e.g., having a diameter of about 2-3 mm or less. In addition, the present invention is useful on one end of a vessel, when the opposite end is already attached to the patient (e.g., at the distal anastomosis of a patient undergoing a CABG procedure). The present invention also allows for the proper length of everted tissue over the tube, bushing, or the like, depending on the requirements of the anastomosis device or method being used. Finally, the present invention may be manufactured inexpensively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, there is a need in this art for novel devices and methods for engaging and everting the end of a blood vessel (or other tubular body organ) over a member such as a tube, ferrule, bushing, or the like which can be used in a quick and effective manner without causing trauma to the vessel or the intima of the vessel (or tubular body organ). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Although this invention has been shown and described with respect to detailed embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and detail thereof may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the claimed invention. </paragraph>
