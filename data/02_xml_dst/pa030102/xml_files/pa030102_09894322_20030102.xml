<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to semiconductor manufacturing, and more particularly to an apparatus for moving a carrier in which semiconductor substrates are stored. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Semiconductor devices are made on substrates, such as silicon wafers or glass plates, for use in computers, monitors, and the like. These devices are made by a sequence of fabrication steps, such as thin film deposition, oxidation or nitration, etching, polishing, and thermal and lithographic processing. Although multiple fabrication steps may be performed in a single processing station, substrates must be transported between processing stations for at least some of the fabrication steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Substrates are stored in cassettes or pods (hereinafter referred to collectively as &ldquo;wafer carriers&rdquo;) for transfer between processing stations and other locations. Although wafer carriers may be carried manually between processing stations, the transfer of wafer carriers is typically automated. For instance, automatic handling of a wafer carrier may be performed by a robot, which lifts the wafer carrier by means of a end effector. As one example, end effectors have been proposed to lift a wafer carrier by engaging a flange provided at the top of the wafer carrier. One known type of end effector includes a support plate and fingers extending downwardly and inwardly from the support plate to define a &ldquo;T&rdquo;-shaped slot. The slot may be moved horizontally over and around the carrier flange. Pins may be provided that protrude upwardly from the end effector fingers to mate with detents provided on the flange. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Successful operation of robots that transport wafer carriers requires that the movements of the robot be controlled with a high degree of precision. It would be desirable to provide a end effector that is forgiving of, and automatically compensates for, minor errors in the positioning of the end effector relative to the wafer carrier. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> According to an aspect of the invention, there is provided a end effector adapted to lift a wafer carrier. The end effector includes a substantially planar, horizontally-extending support member, and a pair of fingers extending downwardly from the support member to define a slot. At least one of the fingers includes an inwardly-and downwardly-extending inclined surface. Preferably each of the fingers includes an inwardly-and downwardly-extending inclined surface, and a horizontal surface extending inwardly from a lower edge of the inclined surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The respective lower edges of the inclined surfaces may be spaced from each other by a distance that corresponds to a width of a flange mounted on top of the wafer carrier to be lifted by the end effector. Each finger may include a vertical surface that extends from the respective inclined surface to the support member. The support member may have a hole formed therein above the slot defined by the pair of fingers. The support member may also include an attachment portion adapted to be attached to a lift mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The end effector may further include a first pin extending horizontally inward from the inclined surface of one of the fingers. The end effector may include a second pin spaced from the first pin and extending vertically upward from the horizontal surface of one of the fingers. The end effector may further include a third pin extending vertically upward from the horizontal surface of the other one of the fingers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the invention, a method of transporting a wafer carrier includes engaging an overhead transport (OHT) flange of the wafer carrier with fingers that extend downwardly from a end effector. The method further includes lifting the wafer carrier by means of the fingers, and, during the lifting step, guiding the OHT flange in a horizontal direction by means of an inclined surface provided on at least one of the fingers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The inclined surface(s) provided on the end effector fingers in accordance with the invention cooperate with the top flange of the wafer carrier to be lifted, so as to passively guide the wafer carrier to a centered position relative to the end effector. Thus, the configuration of the fingers including the inclined surfaces kinematically positions the wafer carrier relative to the end effector and automatically compensates for an initial degree of mispositioning of the end effector relative to the wafer carrier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, according to another aspect of the invention, a horizontal pin provided on one of the fingers cooperates with a feature (e.g., a semicircular groove) formed on the flange of the wafer carrier to accurately position the wafer carrier in a lateral direction. Thus, aspects of the invention may include such an inventive horizontal locating pin and/or one or more inventive inclined surfaces, or may employ either or both of these features to kinematically position a wafer carrier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Further features and advantages of the present invention will become more fully apparent from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments, the appended claims and the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> An end effector provided in accordance with aspects of the invention will now be described, with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is an isometric view, from above, of the inventive end effector. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference> are side and top plan views, respectively, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a side view that shows the inventive end effector positioned to lift a wafer carrier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In the drawings, reference numeral <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> generally indicates the end effector. The end effector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be formed of metal such as aluminum or stainless steel. The end effector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may include a generally planar support member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. At one end of the support member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> an attachment portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be formed. The attachment portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be used to attach the end effector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to a lift mechanism, which is not shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Fingers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> extend downwardly from the support member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The fingers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are spaced from each other and configured so as to define therebetween a T-shaped slot <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, as best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Finger <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> includes an inclined surface <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> that extends inwardly and downwardly at one side of the T-shaped slot <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and finger <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> has an inclined surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> that extends inwardly and downwardly at the other side of the T-shaped slot <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. A first horizontal lifting surface <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may extend inwardly from a lower edge of the inclined surface <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and a second horizontal lifting surface <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> may extend inwardly from a lower edge of the inclined surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. A vertical surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may extend upwardly from the inclined surface <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to the support member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and a vertical surface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may extend upwardly from the inclined surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to the support member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> A horizontal locating pin <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</cross-reference>, which may be provided on the finger <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> extends inwardly above the horizontal surface <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Also provided on the finger <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be a first vertical locating pin <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, which extends upwardly from the horizontal surface <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. A second vertical locating pin <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>) which may be provided on finger <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> extends upwardly from the horizontal surface <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. As used herein, a locating pin is a mechanism designed to interface with a wafer carrier&apos;s overhead transport flange so as to guide the overhead transport flange to a predetermined position relative to the end effector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A large hole <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</cross-reference>) may be is formed in the support member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> above the slot <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). The purpose of the hole <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is to reduce the weight of the end effector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows the end effector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in juxtaposition with a wafer carrier <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to be lifted by the end effector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The wafer carrier <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is of a standard type known as a front opening unified pod (FOUP). The wafer carrier <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> has a top surface <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> on which is mounted a flange <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The flange <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is of the type referred to as an overhead transport (OHT) flange. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In operation the end effector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is moved in a lateral direction (i.e., one of the directions indicated by the double headed arrow <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) to be brought into the position indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> with the T-shaped slot <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> positioned around and below the flange <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The end effector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is then raised. The flange <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is engaged by the fingers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the wafer carrier <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is lifted. To the extent that the end effector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is positioned off-center relative to the flange <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> in the fore-and-aft direction (indicated by double headed arrow <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>), a corresponding one of the inclined surfaces <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> kinematically guides the flange <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> in a horizontal (fore-and-aft) direction so as to center the wafer carrier <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> relative to the end effector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. For this purpose, the respective lower edges of the inclined surfaces <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may be spaced from each other precisely by a distance D (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>), which distance D is equal to the width of the flange <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> in the fore-and-aft direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> At the same time, horizontal locating pin <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> cooperates kinematically with a semicircular groove (not shown) in the flange <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, and vertical locating pins <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> cooperate with respective V-shaped slots (not shown) in the flange <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, to accurately position the wafer carrier <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in the lateral direction (referenced by double headed arrow mark <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). Thus the end effector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is arranged to passively and kinematically obtain accurate positioning of the wafer carrier <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in both the lateral and fore-and-aft directions. The end effector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may have no moving parts and therefore may be inexpensive to manufacture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The end effector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention is suitable for use in connection with a robotic cassette mover of the type shown in a co-pending and commonly-assigned U.S. patent application entitled &ldquo;Apparatus for Storing and Moving a Cassette&rdquo;, Ser. No. 09/201,737, filed Dec. 1, 1998, and incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The foregoing description discloses only a preferred embodiment of the invention; modifications of the above disclosed apparatus which fall within the scope of the invention will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. For example, it is contemplated to replace the horizontal locating pin <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> with another vertical locating pin. However, the horizontal locating pin <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is preferred, because it has a larger capture area than a vertical locating pin would have. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> It is also contemplated to replace the vertical surfaces <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) with inclined surfaces (indicated by dotted lines at <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>) to join the inclined surfaces <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> with the support member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. It is to be understood that even with such extended inclined surfaces, the slot <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> remains T-shaped. Similarly, the horizontal surfaces <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> may be omitted, and any of the optional horizontally and/or vertically extending pins <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> may extend from appropriate locations on the inclined surfaces <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Such an embodiment may employ inclined surfaces <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> that have lower edges that are narrower than the width of the flange <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, as may other embodiments. It should also be understood that the end effector shown in the figures may be modified (1) so as to kinematically position a wafer carrier via a single inclined surface (e.g., with one finger having an inclined surface <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the opposing finger having a vertical surface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and a horizontally extending support surface <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, wherein the inclined vertical surfaces <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> define an opening equal to the width of an OHT flange of a wafer carrier to be lifted by the end effector, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>; or (2) so as to kinematically position a wafer carrier between two the two inclined surfaces at positions other than the lower edge of the inclined surfaces (e.g., any horizontally opposed points along the inclined surfaces may define a space equal to the width of an OHT flange to be supported thereby&mdash;such surfaces are referred to herein as &ldquo;horizontally spaced from each other by a distance that corresponds to the width of the OHT flange.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Moreover, although the end effector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> disclosed herein is useful for transporting a substrate carrier of the type known as a FOUP and used for 300 mm wafers, it is also contemplated that a like end effector may be employed for other types of substrate carrier having an overhead flange, including the well known SMIF (standard mechanical interface) pod used for 200 mm wafers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, while the present invention has been disclosed in connection with a preferred embodiment thereof, it should be understood that other embodiments may fall within the spirit and scope of the invention, as defined by the following claims. </paragraph>
