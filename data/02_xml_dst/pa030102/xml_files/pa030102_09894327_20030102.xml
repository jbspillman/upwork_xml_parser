<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to computer programming and, more particularly, it relates to a transportable identifier and system and method to facilitate access to broadcast data. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Information is distributed in a variety of ways, usually in dependence upon the type of information and the equipment being used to send and receive such information. For example, radio, television and cable networks distribute information by broadcasting signals over predetermined channels in corresponding media. Such broadcasters typically deliver programming according to fixed program schedules to enable users to receive desired program content. Despite best efforts, however, events sometime occur that cause programs to be shifted in time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Multimedia information has been increasing with the evolution of the Internet and other communication infrastructures. Some multimedia information is available by downloading data files. Other multimedia applications require real-time communications of data, commonly referred to as streaming. While streaming data mitigates the need to completely download large files or take up large amounts of disk storage space to utilize the data, in a manner similar to conventional broadcasting, streaming presents various continuity issues. For example, the success associated with streaming data can vary depending on the available bandwidth and interruptions in the data stream. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In order to facilitate streaming of data over communication frameworks, such as the Internet, various protocols have been developed. For example, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has developed enhanced Internet integrated service models, such as include Resource ReServation Protocol (RVSP), Realtime transport Protocol (RTP), and RealTime Streaming Protocol (RTSP). It is anticipated that these and other protocols will continue to evolve to facilitate realtime broadcast of data over the Internet. It is contemplated that the continued efforts also will continue to expand such broadcasts to wireless communication frameworks. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The following presents a simplified summary of the invention in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the invention. This summary is not an extensive overview of the invention. It is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of the invention nor delineate the scope of the invention. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of the invention in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a transportable identifier that includes metadata identifying a temporal broadcast of target data. The identifier, which may be distributed to one or more users, can be employed to locate the broadcast of the target data based on the associated metadata. A user can, in turn, monitor and/or store the target data as it is broadcast. By way of illustration, the broadcast data can include audio data, visual data, data indicative of one or more monitored conditions (e.g., sensory output data), and/or other types of data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A system implementing the present invention can receive broadcast data, including the target data identified by the identifier, over any type of broadcast medium. For example, the data can be distributed via broadband, cellular, satellite, computer network infrastructures (LAN, WAN, etc.), as well as via other types of wired and wireless data communication systems. The metadata of the identifier further includes information to enable the target data to be located for each respective data source that may provide part of the target data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> According to one aspect of the present invention, an identifier represents a temporal presentation of selected data over one or more data streams, such as may include analog and/or digital data over an associated medium. The identifier enables a user of the identifier to locate when and over which data stream(s) the selected data is broadcast, such that the content of the selected data can be monitored and/or stored. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The identifier can be transported to one or more users, such that each user can locate a broadcast of the selected data. As a result, a holder of the identifier can employ the identifier to monitor and/or record corresponding data during one or more subsequent broadcasts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the present invention provides a system to facilitate monitoring and/or recording of temporally presented data. One or more data collection systems collect data, which data might correspond to an event, an entity, a monitored condition, etc. An identification system can be associated with each of the data collection systems and operative to stamp portions of the collected data based at least in part on time, an event and/or an entity. The stamp can include identifying data associated with portions of the collected data that, for example, represent the occurrence of scheduled times when the data is collected, a preselected event, and/or the presence (or absence) of an entity relative to some spatial region. An aggregator aggregates portions of the stamped data, such as based on the identifying data associated with the stamped data. A transportable object is provided to enable a user to locate a broadcast of at least some of the aggregated data to facilitate monitoring and/or storing of such data as it is broadcast. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a particular aspect, an additional data processing mechanism can be associated with the aggregator to segment selected portions of the collected data into different groups based on the stamp associated with such data. Different groups of the segmented data may then be broadcast at different locations and/or at different times, such that a given identifier can identify the location that broadcasts one or more groups of the segmented data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the present invention provides a method to facilitate monitoring and/or recording of data presented via a broadcast medium. The method includes receiving a transportable object that corresponds to a future presentation of associated data. The identifier, for example, includes metadata associated with a scheduled broadcast of the associated data and/or otherwise identifies the content of the broadcast. The transportable object can then be employed to locate the presentation of the associated data, such that a user can monitor and/or store the data as it is presented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, certain illustrative aspects of the invention are described herein in connection with the following description and the annexed drawings. These aspects are indicative, however, of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of the invention may be employed and the present invention is intended to include all such aspects and their equivalents. Other advantages and novel features of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of the invention when considered in conjunction with the drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a system and method to enable a user to locate target data from a temporal presentation of data. A transportable object or identifier, represents the target data. The object or identifier includes metadata that defines the location of the temporal presentation of target data so that the target data can be located. A user thus can employ the object to locate corresponding target data and, in turn, monitor and/or store the target data from the temporal presentation of data. In accordance with a particular aspect, the temporal presentation of data, including the target data, may occur independently from whether a user employs an object to locate such data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> schematically illustrates an implementation <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in which a transportable object <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is utilized to locate a future broadcast of target data <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, such as may be transmitted in a data stream <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The object <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> represents the target data <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and includes metadata <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> that enables a user <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the object to locate the broadcast of the target data in the data stream <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The target data <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may include part of the data being broadcast or it may form the entire stream, such as may have a defined beginning and end. The data stream <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, for example, includes data that has been encoded for transmission over a corresponding medium, such as may include wired and/or wireless media. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The data stream <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> includes data that is transmitted as a function of time (e.g., a temporal broadcast) and may be concurrently accessible by any number of one or more users. However, it is to be appreciated that the broadcast of the data <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, including the target data <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, may occur independently of the user <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> accessing such data. The temporal data stream <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can broadcast data content via any suitable broadcast medium (e.g., broadband or digital cable, satellite, computer network infrastructures, etc.). In general, the source (not shown) of the broadcast data <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> varies according to the type of medium over which the data broadcast. Similarly, the type and content of data that is broadcast in the stream <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> further can vary based on the source of the data stream and the type of information that is being conveyed. For example, the data provided in the broadcast data stream <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> could include audio, video, audio and video, sensor data (e.g., detected by one or more sensors), and/or any other information that may be encoded in an analog or digital form suitable for broadcast over associated broadcast media. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the metadata <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can generally identify the target data <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, which may be broadcast over a corresponding time period using one or more media, or the metadata can specifically identify when and where the target data is broadcast over a particular broadcast medium. In certain circumstances, the object also can include authenticating data to enable user-access to generally private target data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> For example, if the target data <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is broadcast by streaming data over the Internet (or another network), the metadata <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> includes a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) indicative of the broadcast location together with other identifying data from which the target data may be accessed during its broadcast. Such identifying data can take many forms depending on the type of data being broadcast, the broadcast medium, and/or how such data was collected. By way of illustration, the identifying data can include an indication of a future time at which the target data is scheduled to be broadcast. Alternatively or additionally, the identifying data could describe the target data in a manner to enable the beginning and end of its broadcast to be detected in the data stream. While a single data stream <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, those skilled in the art will understand that the target data could be sent over any number of one or more such streams, all of which would be accessible based on the metadata <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in the object <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. By locating the target data <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the user or user of the object can monitor and/or record the target data as it is broadcast in the data stream <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The user <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can include any device (hardware or software) capable of communicating data, including the object. For example, the user <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be a personal computer, a handheld appliance (e.g., PDA, cellular telephone, etc.), an application running on a computer, or part of an entertainment system that communicates data through an associated communications link <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The link <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be coupled to a Wide Area Network (WAN), such as an intranet or the Internet, or a Local Area Network (LAN). The object <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be downloaded from a remote computer, received by subscription, or sent to the user <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> via a mail delivery system. The user <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> further may be able to send the object to one or more other users using the communications link <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Those skilled in the art will understand and appreciate that the object <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be manually stored in the user, such as from an associated removable storage device. The communication of the object to and/or from the user <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> further may occur over the data stream, although separate communication channels also could be employed in accordance with an aspect of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates another example of a system <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> implementing a transportable object <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to locate a broadcast of target data <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> in accordance with an aspect of the present invention. A user <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the object <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> employs the object to locate the target data <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> while it broadcast at an associated data location, indicated as Data Location <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (DL<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>). The user <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> may be hardware and/or software, such as a computer, an application or service running on a personal computer, an entertainment appliance, a handheld computer, a cellular telephone, or other type of system. The data location may be a channel, such as may have a predetermined frequency and bandwidth, a URL, a series of associated data packets, or any other unit in which information can be broadcast. The object <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> further includes metadata <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> that enables the user <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> to locate the target data as it is broadcast at DL<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>. In the example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, DL<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>is one of several data locations (DL<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>to DL<highlight><subscript>N</subscript></highlight>, where N is an integer &gE;1) implemented in a broadcast medium, schematically illustrated as <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> It is to be appreciated that different parts of the target data <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> could be broadcast at different locations and/or at different times in the broadcast medium <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. In addition, different parts of the target data can be broadcast over other broadcast media different from the medium <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. For example, a video portion of audio-visual data can be broadcast over a broadband cable medium while an associated audio portion is broadcast over radio, on a subcarrier frequency with the video portion of the data, and/or streamed via the Internet. In such circumstances, the metadata <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> further would enable each of such locations to be located so that the user can monitor and/or store the component parts of that form the target data <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The user <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> also can include a communications device <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, which is operative to establish a communications link <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> between the user and one or more remote devices <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. The communications device <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, which may be a modem, a communications server, a network interface, etc., enables the user <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> to send and/or receive objects and other data relative to the user <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Memory <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> also may be associated with the user <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, such as for storing the target data identified by the metadata <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. The memory <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> may include volatile memory (e.g., RAM) and/or non-volatile memory (ROM, Flash, disk drive, floppy disk drive, CD-ROM, etc.). An output device, such as a display <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, also may be associated with the user <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> for providing a graphical and/or audible representation of data received at the user and/or data that may have been stored in the memory <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. The user also can be associated with other types of output devices, such as audio speakers, television, and/or any other appliance capable of converting such data to a human-perceptable form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> One or more sources <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of data provide data at the locations DL<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>to DL<highlight><subscript>N </subscript></highlight>of the medium <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The data locations may represent physical locations from where the data is broadcast, channels in a radio frequency spectrum (wired or wireless) over which data is broadcast, or other transmission units by which data may be broadcast. The broadcast data provides a temporal presentation of data that varies over time and which may be received or accessed during broadcast by one or more persons. It is to be appreciated that the information broadcast at the data locations DL<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>to DL<highlight><subscript>N</subscript></highlight>, including the target data <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, can occur independently of the user <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> accessing such data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In one aspect, the target data <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> may require authentication (e.g., a password) to access such data in a readable form. The requisite authentication may be provided as part of the object <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> that represents the target data <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, such as in the metadata <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. Alternatively or additionally, a predetermined password or other authentication scheme may be employed, which may be stored in the memory <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> associated with the user <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The authentication, for example, includes a key for a decryption algorithm that enables the target data to be properly decoded or demodulated so as to permit such data to be presented in a usable form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> By way of illustration, the target data <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> can correspond to an audio and/or visual program that is scheduled to be broadcast at a particular data location at a future time. The user <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> can obtain the transportable object (or identifier) representing the future broadcast to enable the user to locate the target data when it is broadcast based on the metadata <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> encapsulated in the object <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. As a result, the user <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> can monitor the target data with the output device <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> while it is broadcast via the broadcast medium <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Alternatively or additionally, the user <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> can store the target data in memory <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> while it broadcast via the broadcast medium <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Because the object <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is transportable, the object can be shared with one or more other users to enable similar monitoring and storing of the identified target data as it is broadcast. By storing the broadcast, the system performs a desired time shifting function enabled by the transportable object <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> in accordance with an aspect of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In one particular aspect, the object <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> represents a temporal broadcast of sensor data. The sensor data, for example, may be obtained by one or more sensors that monitor conditions associated with a place (e.g., equipment health and operating status in a factory; security surveillance video and alarm conditions for a facility; audio and/or video coverage for a facility and/or event, etc). In such an example, the associated metadata <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> for the object <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> may represent the path or location to desired content, access, broadcast window, as well as scheduling information needed to locate the target sensor data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In addition or alternatively, the broadcast of the target data can correspond to a live (or time-delayed) real-time delivery of such data. In such circumstances, the object is provided to one or more selected users prior to its associated broadcast to enable the user to locate the target data during its real-time broadcast. Those skilled in the art will understand and appreciate that data can be delivered via the broadcast medium more than one time so that the target data can be located at a convenient time to facilitate monitoring and/or storing of the data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates an example of a system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in which more than one user <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, identified as USER <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through USER N (where N is an integer &gE;1) can utilize respective transportable objects <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to locate target data <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> from a temporal presentation of data in accordance with an aspect of the present invention. In this example, the objects <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> represent the same target data <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, which is broadcast at DL<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>over an associated time period. While, for purposes of brevity, one object <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is illustrated at each user <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, respectively, those skilled in the art will understand and appreciate that each user could have more than one object and that such objects need not represent the same target data <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Each of the objects <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> encapsulates metadata <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> that enables each respective user <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to locate the temporal presentation of the identified target data <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. The extent of the information contained in the metadata <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> may vary as a function of the type of target data <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and the type of broadcast medium <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> by which each user can access the broadcast. Because the objects enable a user <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to locate the target data <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> during its broadcast time period, the located target data can be monitored and/or recorded by the user while the target data is broadcast. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In the example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, one or more sources (not shown) broadcast information over the broadcast medium <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The broadcast medium <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> can be divided into one or more data locations (DL<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>to DL<highlight><subscript>N</subscript></highlight>, where N is an integer &gE;1), each of which can broadcast content concurrently via the medium <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The target data <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is broadcast over a particular time period at data location DL<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> For purposes of simplicity of explanation, the data locations DL<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>to DL<highlight><subscript>N </subscript></highlight>are illustrated as part of a graph that delivers data over time. It is to be appreciated that the data locations can correspond to channels in a radio frequency spectrum (wired or wireless), URLs, or other transmittable units through which data can be broadcast to one or more users. Additionally, while the data content associated with the channels DL<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>to DL<highlight><subscript>N </subscript></highlight>is depicted as being continuous over time, those skilled in the art will understand and appreciate that the content associated with the channels could be non-continuous or interrupted. For example, one or more channels DL<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>to DL<highlight><subscript>N </subscript></highlight>can lie quiescent until the occurrence of a selected event or a condition, which may cause a corresponding broadcast to occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The implementation <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> also includes a communications framework <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> that can be employed to facilitate communication between the users <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The communication framework <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> also can enable communication between the users <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and one or more remote computers <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. In an example where the users <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, and the computer(s) <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> are distributed between a plurality of physical devices, the communication framework <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> can include, for example, networking hardware and software to enable wired and/or wireless communication between such physical devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The computer(s) <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> can include a service or process <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> running thereon that can provide the users <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> with their respective objects. A user can acquire objects, for example, by downloading initiated by the user and/or by another user or service sending the objects. By way of illustration, the process <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> can contain list of audio and/or visual programs that are intended to be broadcast in the future, such as according to a defined broadcast schedule. It is to be appreciated that the broadcast schedule for a given program can vary between different local tuning spaces. Accordingly, the metadata <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> in the objects available from the computer(s) <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> can include specific information about the content of a selected audio and/or visual program (e.g., program title, channel, genre, actors and actresses, description, etc.); however no information about actual time scheduling information for recording need be provided in the metadata. Instead, other services, such as may run in the computer(s) <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> or be otherwise associated with the users <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, can supplement the metadata <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> based on the instructions provided at the user. Alternatively, the service <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> can send the objects <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to one or more of the users <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, such as according to a subscription to which the users belong. Because of the transportable nature of the objects, any user <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> can send an object to another user. For example, the object can be sent directly from one of the users <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> or at the request of a user, a service, such as at the computer(s) <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, can send the object to the requested destination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the present invention, a transportable object can represent a future temporal broadcast of sensor data over a broadcast medium. The sensor data, for example, may be obtained by one or more sensors or other data collection devices that monitor conditions associated with an entity (e.g., a person, place or thing). By way of illustration, the conditions could include: equipment health and operating status of equipment in a factory; security surveillance video and alarm conditions for a facility; audio and/or video coverage for a facility and/or event; etc. The metadata for such a transportable object may represent the path or location to desired content, access, broadcast window, as well as scheduling information needed to locate the corresponding target data. By employing the object <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and/or <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to locate corresponding target data <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, one or more users <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> can monitor and/or record that piece of content during its broadcast over the broadcast medium <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, the transportable objects <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> further includes a representation of recording instructions for a specific data location to facilitate recording of the target data <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> while it is broadcast. The object <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> or an associated method or function can further permit a user to specify various features and/or set parameters associated with the recording that is to be performed. For the example where the target data represents an audio and/or visual program (or a portion of a program), the object and/or its associated application can permit the user to set recording parameters indicating how often to record a given show (e.g., once or daily). The object <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> further can employ a function or method, which is programmed to notify the user (e.g., via email, pager, cell phone, etc.) that the show has successfully recorded. One or more other associated methods or functions further can be called to transfer the show to transportable media (e.g., Flash RAM, DVD, etc.) and/or to erase or archive previous episodes of the recorded program, such as when the program is a series. Those skilled in the art will understand and appreciate other features that can be implemented in conjunction with a transportable object in accordance with the present invention. </paragraph>

The regions <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> may correspond to different parts of a facility (e.g., daycare, prison, amusement park, etc.), such as where one or more persons meander into and out of the various regions. For example, each data collection device <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> may be a camera operative to capture an image (still or motion picture) of persons and things located within its associated region. The data collection device(s) <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> thus can provide a signal to the aggregator corresponding to time-based images of their regions. In one particular aspect, the data collection device <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> provides image data together with identifying data for entities to indicate when they are when located within their associated regions. In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, multiple data collection devices could be associated with each region (or the data collection devices could be configured) to collect information about a plurality of different conditions or events that occur in each associated region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The aggregator <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> can process data from each of the data collection device <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and aggregate selected parts of the data into a serial data stream, such as based on the identifying data that stamped onto the collected data. The aggregated data, in turn, can be broadcast as the target data <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. For example, collected data that includes a PIN or other identifying data for a particular entity <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> is separated from other collected data having a different or no identifying data. In this way, the aggregator <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> can provide aggregated data as target data of a temporal data stream for each entity <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> (e.g., a person or article) that can be located in the facility <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the aggregator <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> processes the collected data and create a temporal data stream that can include target data for each identified entity based on the identifying data associated with the collected data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The aggregator <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> provides aggregated data to a broadcast source <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, which broadcasts temporal data via one or more broadcast media <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>. For example, the broadcast source <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> concurrently broadcasts over television, radio and/or a global communications framework (e.g., the Internet). While one broadcast source <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, it is to be appreciated the aggregator <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> can provide the aggregated data to any number of one or more such sources. As mentioned above, the user <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> includes the object <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> that represents the target data <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, such that the user can locate the corresponding target data while it is broadcast. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The facility <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> at which the data is collected can send interested persons the objects in advance, so that users of the object can monitor and/or record a future broadcast of data, such as associated with a given entity <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight>. Because the object <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is transportable, it can be sent to other interested parties as identified by the user <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, such via a communications framework (not shown, but See, e.g., FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>). The user(s) <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> may employ the object <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> to locate the target data from its corresponding temporal presentation as it is broadcast over the medium <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>. As a result, the user(s) <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> can record the target data <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> as it is broadcast via the medium <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> in associated memory <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> and/or monitor the data, such as graphical images on an associated display (e.g., monitor or television) <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight>. In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, transportable objects can be sent to one or more users so that such users can monitor and/or record the target data from the temporal broadcast(s) associated with a given entity or group of entities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> By way of further example, to provide an added measure of security, the metadata <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> of the object <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> can include authentication data to enable the user <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> to receive and/or properly decode the target data <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. The authentication is useful for circumstances when it is desirable to limit access to the broadcast of the target data <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. For example, it may be desirable to permit selected individuals (e.g., family and friends) to locate certain types of broadcast data, such as when the target data involves children (e.g., activities at a daycare or a school), personal events, etc. The authentication protocol further can be employed to help ensure that only authorized users are able to record and/or monitor certain target data, such as based on subscription rights and payments for selected target data. For example, the authentication data enables the user <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> to appropriate decode and/or demodulate the target data into a user-perceptable form, such as based on a password provided in the object <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> By way of particular example, a class play or other time-based event is scheduled to occur a given afternoon in the future, but a person is unable to attend the event and watch the program live. Presume that the person has a system according to the present invention. The facility may employ one or more cameras to record the event and broadcast the program live (or delayed) over some broadcast media (e.g., the Internet, a local cable channel). Prior to the event, the school presenting the event (or a service at the facility&apos;s instructions), sends a transportable object to selected parties, such as family members, regular attendees, etc. The transportable object includes metadata, as described herein, that enables recipients of the object to locate the subsequent broadcast(s) of the event. The object also can include authentication data (e.g., a password) to enable viewing or access of the associated broadcast(s) of the event, which is to be presented later. The recipients of the objects can forward the object to appropriate family members and friends in other parts of the country, such as by email. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The object further can include or otherwise identify methods or functions for controlling monitoring and/or recording of the broadcast of the event. Upon opening the transportable object, users can adjust the parameters to optimize picture quality for their video/PC configuration and available bandwidth, as well as provide desired alerts, such as a notification as to when the program is completed for viewing. Provided the object has been employed to locate and record the broadcast of the event, in accordance with an aspect of the present invention, the associated hardware and/or software will proceed to find the broadcast presentation of target data based on the media captured by the cameras. The user hardware and/or software further can record and store the target data for the play to include audio-visual data captured by all the cameras. After or during the broadcast, one can pick and choose best view, such as to see a desired participant of the event, and transfer their selections to their home server which copies over the edited version based on the selections of the best view. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In order to provide additional context for various aspects of the present invention, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> and the following discussion are intended to provide a brief, general description of one possible suitable environment <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> in which the various aspects of the present invention may be implemented. It is to be appreciated that the computing environment <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is but one possible computing environment and is not intended to limit the environments with which the present invention can be employed. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the inventive methods can be practiced with other system configurations, including single-processor or multiprocessor computer systems, minicomputers, mainframe computers, as well as personal computers, hand-held computing devices, microprocessor-based or programmable consumer electronics, and the like, each of which may be operatively coupled to one or more associated devices. The illustrated aspects of the invention can also be practiced in distributed computing environments where certain tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a communications network. In a distributed computing environment, program modules may be located in both local and remote memory storage devices. The illustrative environment <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> generally relates to a personal computer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, although it will be apparent that various other types of equipment may utilize a transportable object, in accordance with an aspect of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> While various aspects of the present invention have been described above in the general context of computer-executable instructions that may run on one or more computers or other microprocessor-based equipment, it is to be recognized that the invention also may be implemented in combination with other program modules and/or as a combination of hardware and software. Generally, program modules include routines, programs, components, data structures, etc. that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates one possible hardware configuration to support the systems and methods described herein. It is to be appreciated that although a standalone architecture is illustrated, that any suitable computing environment can be employed in accordance with the present invention. For example, computing architectures including, but not limited to, stand alone, multiprocessor, distributed, client/server, minicomputer, mainframe, supercomputer, digital and analog can be employed in accordance with the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the exemplary environment <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> for implementing various aspects of the invention includes a computer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, including a processing unit <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, a system memory <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, and a system bus <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> that couples various system components including the system memory to the processing unit <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. The processing unit <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> may be any of various commercially available processors. Dual microprocessors and other multi-processor architectures also can be used as the processing unit <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. The computer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and/or portions thereof may be implemented as any electronic appliance operable to communicate with a Web-based service, such as, for example, a telephone (wired or wireless), a personal computer (PC) (e.g., handheld, desktop, portable, etc.), a roaming PC, a PDA, or any other suitable microprocessor-based appliance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The system bus <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> may be any of several types of bus structure including a memory bus or memory controller, a peripheral bus, and a local bus using any of a variety of commercially available bus architectures. The system memory <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> includes read only memory (ROM) <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and random access memory (RAM) <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. A basic input/output system (BIOS) <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, containing the basic routines that help to transfer information between elements within the computer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, such as during start-up, is stored in ROM <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The computer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> may further include a hard disk drive <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>, a magnetic disk drive <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>, e.g., to read from or write to a removable disk <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, and an optical disk drive <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>, e.g., for reading and/or writing data relative to <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> optical media. The hard disk drive <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>, magnetic disk drive <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>, and optical disk drive <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> are connected to the system bus <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> by a hard disk drive interface <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight>, a magnetic disk drive interface <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight>, and an optical drive interface <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The computer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> typically includes at least some form of computer readable media. Computer readable media can be any available media that can be accessed by the computer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. By way of example, computer readable media may comprise computer storage media and communication media. Computer storage media may include volatile and nonvolatile, removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information such as computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules, or other data. Computer storage media may include RAM, ROM, EEPROM, flash memory or other memory technology, CD-ROM, digital versatile disks (DVD), or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium which can be used to store the desired information and which can be accessed by the computer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. Communication media typically embodies computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data in a modulated data signal such as a carrier wave or other transport mechanism and includes any information delivery media. A modulated data signal includes a signal that has one or more of its characteristics set or changed in such a manner as to encode information provided in the signal. By way of example, communication media may include wired media such as a wired network or direct-wired connection, and wireless media such as acoustic, RF, optical and other wireless media. Combinations of any of the above should also be included within the scope of computer readable media. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> A number of program modules may be stored in the drives and RAM <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, including an operating system <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>, one or more application programs <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight>, other program modules <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight>, and program non-interrupt data <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight>. The operating system <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> in the illustrated computer can be any of a number of commercially available or proprietary operating systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> A user may enter commands and information into the computer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> through a keyboard <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> and a pointing device, such as a mouse <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight>. Other input devices (not shown) may include a microphone, an IR remote control, a joystick, a game pad, a satellite dish, a scanner, or the like. These and other input devices are often connected to the processing unit <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> through a serial port interface <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight> that is coupled to the system bus <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, but may be connected by other interfaces, such as a parallel port, a game port, a Universal Serial Bus (&ldquo;USB&rdquo;), an IR interface, etc. A monitor <highlight><bold>346</bold></highlight>, or other type of display device, is also connected to the system bus <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> via an interface, such as a video adapter <highlight><bold>348</bold></highlight>. In addition to the monitor, a computer typically includes other peripheral output devices (not shown), such as speakers, printers etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The computer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> may operate in a networked environment using logical connections to one or more remote computers, such as a remote computer(s) <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight>. The remote computer(s) <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> may be a workstation, a server computer, a router, a personal computer, a microprocessor based entertainment appliance, a peer device, or other common network node. The remote computer may include many or all of the elements described relative to the computer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, although, for purposes of brevity, only a memory <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> is illustrated. The logical connections depicted include a local area network (LAN) <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> and a wide area network (WAN) <highlight><bold>366</bold></highlight>, such as the Internet. Such networking environments are commonplace in offices, enterprise-wide computer networks, intranets, and the Internet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> When used in a LAN networking environment, the computer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is connected to the local network <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> through a network interface or adapter <highlight><bold>368</bold></highlight>. When used in a WAN networking environment, the computer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> typically includes a modem <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight>, or is connected to a communications server on the LAN, or has other means for establishing communications over the WAN <highlight><bold>366</bold></highlight>. The modem <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight>, which may be internal or external relative to the computer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, is connected to the system bus <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> via the serial port interface <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight>. In a networked environment, program modules <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight>, application programs, or portions thereof, may be stored in the remote memory storage device <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight>. Similarly, when the computer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> stores target data, such data may be stored in memory <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> of the computer or remote memory <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight>. It will be appreciated that the network connections shown are exemplary and other means of establishing a communications link between the computers may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In view of the exemplary systems and features shown and described above, methodologies, which may be implemented in accordance with the present invention, will be better appreciated with reference to the flow diagrams of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. While, for purposes of simplicity of explanation, the methodology is shown and described implementing serially, it is to be understood and appreciated that the present invention is not limited by the illustrated order, as some aspects may, in accordance with the present invention, occur in different orders and/or concurrently with other blocks from that shown and described herein. Moreover, not all illustrated features may be required to implement a methodology in accordance with the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The methodology may be described in the general context of computer-executable instructions, such as program modules, executed by one or more computers or other devices. Generally, program modules include routines, programs, objects, components, data structures, etc. that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. Typically the functionality of the program modules may be combined or distributed as desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates a methodology to locate target data in a temporal broadcast in accordance with the present invention. The methodology begins at <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> in which general initializations occur, such as upon activating a system that is to implement the methodology. Such initializations include, for example, allocating memory, establishing pointers, establishing data communications, acquiring resources, instantiating objects and setting initial values for variables. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Next, at <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, a transportable object is acquired. The object, for example, may be obtained via a communications framework implementing an associated communications protocol. For example, the object may be downloaded from a server, sent (e.g., as part of an email message) from a friend or family member, provided to a user from a subscription service to which the user belongs, etc. The object represents target data that is to be broadcast at some time in the future. In particular, the transportable object includes metadata that identifies the broadcast of the target data with sufficient particularity so that the temporal presentation of target data may be located. The particular information included in the metadata may vary according to the type of target data represented by the object and the media over which a user may access such data. For an example of audio and/or video programming, the metadata may include specific information about the program content (e.g., title, producer, actors and actresses, and none about actual time scheduling information for recording. For an example where the object represents for sensor data, the metadata may identify the path or location to content, access, broadcast window, and/or scheduling information needed for locating and recording and/or monitoring the corresponding target sensor data. The metadata further may include authentication information to enable monitoring and/or recording of the target data and/or playback of recorded data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> At <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, the transportable object is activated or opened. For example, such activation may implement a graphical user interface that provides selectable options to a user relating to the target data represented by the object. At <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>, a determination is made as to whether any of the selectable options have been set by the user. By way of example, the options may include parameters that control recording (e.g., how often to record a program), an option to notify the user after the target data has been stored in a readily accessible form, an instruction to transfer recorded target data to a different computer-readable medium (e.g., Flash ROM). Another option may include sending the transportable object to one or more other users, such as an email attachment or as part of another type of message. It is to be appreciated that the transportable object may be sent and/or received by any communications modality, both wired and wireless. In addition, a user or service may send or forward the object to intended users without activating the object, such as by employing communications means (hardware and/or software) associated with the sender&apos;s equipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> If one or more object-related option has been selected (<highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>), the methodology proceeds to <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>, in which appropriate parameters, attributes and properties are set to carry out the selected action. The methodology then proceeds to <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. If the determination at <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> is negative, indicating that no options have been set to conditions different from their default conditions, the methodology also proceeds to <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> At <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, the location of the target data is determined based on the metadata encapsulated within the object. As mentioned above, the location may vary according to the type of data being broadcast and/or the equipment being employed to access and obtain the broadcast. That is, the object and associated metadata are employed to locate the time and location at which the target data is broadcast. For example, a location resolution algorithm may be employed, which determines the location and time when the target data will be broadcast over an associated medium. The algorithm may vary according to the medium over which the target data is to be broadcast and/or the type of content. At <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>, after the broadcast location for the target data has been determined, the temporal broadcast of the target data is located. Because the broadcast time (and/or location) may not be absolutely discernable before the broadcast begins, the user may receive and buffer the data broadcast at the determined broadcast location beginning at an approximate time until the desired target data is detected. For example, the broadcaster may provide metadata, such as a schedule or notification, within the broadcast data indicating when new data is to be broadcast. The user may employ such broadcast metadata to capture the identified target media. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> At <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>, the broadcast of the target data may be monitored. The monitoring may include presenting the data in human-perceivable media at an appropriate interface, such as a monitor, television, radio, or other display device. Alternatively or additionally, the target data (e.g., sensor data) may be presented in a machine-readable format, which may be processed to evaluate and report on information contained in the target data. The report may, in turn, be presented in a human readable media. From <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>, the methodology proceeds to <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> At <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight>, a determination is made as to whether the target data has been slated for recording or storing. If the determination is affirmative, the methodology proceeds to <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> in which the real-time broadcast of the target data is recorded or stored. The recording, for example, may occur locally in a local storage device and/or remotely at an associated data storage system (e.g., part of a storage area network or remote storage device). After the target data has been recorded, post-recording actions are implemented at <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight>. The post-recording action, for example, may include operations selected by the user at <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> and/or other operations associated with notification, storing the target data, and/or archiving and moving other stored data. It is to be appreciated that the recording may occur concurrently with the monitoring (<highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>), although subsequent monitoring or playback of the recorded target data also may occur. By storing the broadcast target data, a time-shifting function is provided in which a user may monitor the target data at a more convenient time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> From <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> the methodology ends at <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>. Similarly, if the target data is not recorded (a negative determination at <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight>), the methodology also advances from <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> to end at <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> What has been described above includes exemplary implementations of the present invention. It is, of course, not possible to describe every conceivable combination of components or methodologies for purposes of describing the present invention, but one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that many further combinations and permutations of the present invention are possible. Accordingly, the present invention is intended to embrace all such alterations, modifications and variations that fall within the spirit and scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
