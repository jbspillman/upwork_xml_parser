<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">An interference fit screw driver has a polygonal driving surface to impart torque to a corresponding surface in a screw. The end of the polygonal driving surface has a frusto-conical shaped gripping member which fits into an aperture in the screw to create a friction fit between the screw and screw driver. This allows the screw to be attached to the screw driver to facilitate installation of the screw. The friction fit is tight enough to hold the screw to the driver, yet allows the driver to be easily disengaged from the screw by pulling the driver away from the screw once the screw is lodged in place. The interference fit screw driver is particularly useful in turning bone screws into the spine of a patient during orthopedic surgery. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 1. The Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally driving tools, and more particularly, but not necessarily entirely, to screw drivers capable being attached to screws by an interference fit for use in orthopedic surgery, to turn bone screws into the spine of a patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A typical screw driver known in the art has a driving surface or bit which mates with a complementary recess on a screw to allow the screw driver to impart torque to the screw. An area of concern related to screw drivers has been retaining the screw on the bit of the driver while positioning the screw. This aspect of screw drivers is particularly important in the medical profession, for example, as bone screws are inserted into the spine of a patient during orthopedic surgery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Screw drivers known in the prior art have used various techniques to attach the screws to the bits. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,970,922 (granted Nov. 20, 1990 to Krivec) discloses a rotatable driving tool having a plurality of substantially circularly helical driving portions with small helix angles. The driving portions mate with lobes of the fastener recess but are slightly inclined with respect to the lobes. This provides a wedge fit to retain the fastener with the tool. However, the inclined driving portions allow the driver to efficiently apply torque only in one direction. If torque is applied to the fastener in the opposite direction, the inclined driving portions force the driver out of engagement with the lobes of the fastener. Thus, a reverse driver may be required to remove the screw. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Another approach has been to use a tapered bit on the driving tool which is adapted to wedge into the recess of the screw. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,269,246 (granted May 26, 1981 to Larson et al.) discloses a driver bit with multiple lobes. The lobes are tapered axially, converging toward the tip end of the driver. The driver bit enters a socket of the fastener to a predetermined depth before wedging the fastener to the driver. A disadvantage of this arrangement is that the bit engages the fastener only at the outer end of the socket. This results in inefficient transfer of the torque from the driving member to the fastener. Also the concentration of force at one contact location tends to wear and deform the socket in the contact region. Furthermore, close tolerances are necessary in order to provide the proper wedge fit in a consistent manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,277,531 (granted Jan. 11, 1994 to Krivec) discloses another technique for attaching a fastener to a tool. This patent discloses a polygonal shaped tool fitting a socket recess formed in a fastener. The recess has planar drive surfaces alternating with sloping retaining surfaces. The polygonal tool is wedged in contact with the sloping retaining surfaces to retain the fastener on the tool. This configuration also reduces the contact area between the tool and the fastener. Furthermore, if significant torque is applied to the fastener, the retaining surfaces may become tightly wedged to the tool making it difficult to release the fastener. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> An additional type of retention technique is the use of a magnetized bit on the driving tool. However, this type of retention is only useful in screws formed of magnetic material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The prior art is thus characterized by several disadvantages that are addressed by the present invention. The present invention minimizes, and in some aspects eliminates, the above-mentioned failures, and other problems, by utilizing the methods and structural features described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In view of the foregoing state of the art, it would be an advancement in the art to provide an interference fit screw driver which is simple in design and manufacture which is attached to a screw by a friction fit to facilitate positioning the screw. It would be a further advancement in the art to provide such a screw driver which is capable of applying torque in two directions and which engages the screw over a large surface area such that wear and deformation of the screw and screw driver are reduced, and which can be released from the screw even after a large torque has been applied to the screw by the screw driver. It would be an additional advancement in the art to provide a screw driver which is capable of retaining contact with screws made of nonmagnetic materials. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> For the purposes of promoting an understanding of the principles in accordance with the invention, reference will now be made to the embodiments illustrated in the drawings and specific language will be used to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended. Any alterations and further modifications of the inventive features illustrated herein, and any additional applications of the principles of the invention as illustrated herein, which would normally occur to one skilled in the relevant art and having possession of this disclosure, are to be considered within the scope of the invention claimed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> side view is shown of an exemplary embodiment of a screw driver <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, also referred to herein more generally as a tool, and a screw <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, also referred to herein more generally as a driven member, in accordance with the principles of the present invention. The screw driver <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is preferably substantially cylindrical shaped having a longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and includes a body <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> having a proximal end <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and a distal end <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The body <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> preferably includes a fitting <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> disposed on the proximal end <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, to allow a user to attach an implement, such as a wrench, to facilitate applying torque if necessary. The fitting <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may be a polygonal surface or socket for example. However, as those skilled in the art will appreciate, various different configurations may be used as fittings within the scope of the present invention. The body <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> also preferably includes a handle <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> disposed on the proximal end <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to facilitate gripping the body <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> so that torque may be applied more easily without slipping. The handle <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> may be formed of a series of grooves or knurls in the body <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to create a frictional surface. Other varieties of handles known in the art may also be used within the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> A driving means <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is preferably disposed on the distal end <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the body <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The driving means <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has a first end <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, a second end <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, and preferably has a constant cross-sectional configuration throughout the length of the driving means <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The constant cross-section allows efficient transfer of torque from the screw driver <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the screw <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> without the tendency to separate as is common with tapered driving surfaces. Also, the constant cross-sectional configuration allows the drive means <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to impart torque efficiently when rotated in both clockwise and counter-clockwise directions. This feature is an improvement over driving surfaces with curved or angled driving surfaces which work transfer torque efficiently only in one direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The driving means <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is preferably polygonal in shape. For example, the polygonal shape of the driving means <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be a hexagonal shape as shown most clearly in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. However, as those skilled in the art will appreciate, driving surfaces of various shapes, such as star shapes, cross shapes, blade shapes, or fluted configurations, may be used within the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> A gripping means <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is preferably disposed on the second end <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of the driving means <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for gripping the screw <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to removably attach the screw <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to the screw driver <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The gripping means <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is preferably substantially frusto-conical in shape, however other configurations are possible within the scope of the present invention. The gripping means <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is preferably located along the axis <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> such that a break <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is disposed radially from the longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> between the driving means <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the gripping means <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The separation of the gripping means <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> from the driving means <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> allows the gripping means <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to function independently from the driving means and vice versa. The function of the gripping means <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is described more fully below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The driving means <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> preferably has a radial dimension <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> from the longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the tool which is larger than a radial dimension <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the gripping means <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The difference in radial dimension forms the radial break <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to separate the drive means <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> from the gripping means <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and to provide a larger surface area to the driving means <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for applying torque than for gripping the screw. Preferably the radial dimension <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of the driving means <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is sized in a range of between approximately two to four times the radial dimension <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the gripping means <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> from the longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The screw <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> preferably includes a first aperture <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and a second aperture <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The first aperture <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is preferably aligned coaxially with the second aperture <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and smaller than the second aperture <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, such that the second aperture <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> circumscribes the first aperture. The first aperture <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is defined by a circumferential edge <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> which is engaged by the gripping means <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to attach the screw <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to the screw driver <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The first aperture <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and edge <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are preferably circular in shape, however, various shapes may be used within the scope of the present invention. The second aperture <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is preferably defined by a socket <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> which is engaged by the driving means <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the screw driver <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to form an interference fit. The socket <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> preferably has a shape which corresponds to the shape of the driving means <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, such as hexagonal for example. However, it will be appreciated that the socket <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> may have various corresponding shapes of polygons, stars, crosses, blades, or fluted configurations for example, within the scope of the invention. The screw <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> also preferably has threads <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of any variety known in the art. However, the principles of the present invention may be applied to any such driven member which may employ other engaging means such as flanges or pins for example, besides threads. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In use, the screw <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is attached to the screw driver <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by inserting the gripping means <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> into the first aperture <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to the point where the edge <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> engages the gripping means <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to wedge the gripping means <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> against the edge <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> with a friction fit. Preferably, the area of contact between the gripping means <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the edge <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is large enough to supply sufficient force to attach the screw <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to the screw driver <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, yet small enough such that the screw <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be released when desired without undue effort. As the gripping means <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> enters the first aperture <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the driving means <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is aligned against the socket <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The surface area of the contact between the driving means <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the socket <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is large as compared to the contact between the gripping means <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the edge <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. This relationship allows efficient transfer of torque from the screw driver <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the screw <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> without imposing concentrated loads on a single point. Furthermore, since the contact between the driving means <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the socket <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is separate from the contact between the gripping means <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the edge <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the screw <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be easily released from the screw driver <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, regardless of how much torque is applied. In other words, a high torque placed on the socket <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> by the driving means <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, has no effect on the frictional connection between the gripping means <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the edge <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Once it is desired to release the screw <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> from the screw driver <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the screw driver <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is simply pulled from the screw <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with a force sufficient to overcome the frictional fit between the gripping means <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the edge <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Manufacturing of the present invention is facilitated since the gripping means <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and edge <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> need not be constructed to exact dimensions to allow proper attachment of the screw <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to the screw driver <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The tapered surface of the gripping means <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> allows a friction fit against the edge <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> at various longitudinal locations along the gripping means <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> depending upon the size of the first aperture <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, since the screw <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is attached to the screw driver <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by a friction fit, the use of magnetic materials is not necessary. The screw driver <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and screw <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be constructed of various materials know to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Reference will now to made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> to describe a second embodiment of the present invention. As previously discussed, the presently preferred embodiments of the invention illustrated herein are merely exemplary of the possible embodiments of the invention, including that illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that the second embodiment of the invention illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> contains many of the same structures represented in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and only the new or different structures will be explained to most succinctly explain the additional advantages which come with the embodiments of the invention illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The second embodiment of the invention includes a tapered member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>disposed on the screw <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and a gripping means including a first aperture <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and edge <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>disposed on the screw driver <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The function of the second embodiment of the invention is similar to that of the first embodiment. An advantage of the second embodiment is that the tapered member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is protected within the socket <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Therefore, damage to the tapered member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is less likely so that a proper fit between the screw <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the screw driver <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is allowed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the features and combinations described above, a preferred method of driving a driven member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with a tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes the steps of: </paragraph>
