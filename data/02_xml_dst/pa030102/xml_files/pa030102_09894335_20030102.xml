<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to electrical stress testing and, more particularly, to stress testing of semiconductor devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> During the manufacture of semiconductor devices, various types of defects and failures may occur. A failure occurs when a semiconductor device fails to meet its design specifications. A defect occurs when a semiconductor device has an improper structure which may result in an immediate failure of the device, or the device may have the potential to fail during its expected lifetime. For example, due to a manufacturing error, a semiconductor device having a structure such as a metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitor may have a latent defect such as thinned electrodes or tiny holes within the insulating material. As a result, the device might sustain a short, a decreased capacitance, or break down over a period of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Testing is performed on semiconductor devices in order to locate defects and failures in such devices. Specifically, various populations of devices, such as MIM capacitors, may be subjected to controlled stress test conditions as part of a quality and reliability assurance program for commercial use. During these stress tests, one or more MIM capacitors are typically subjected to a stress test voltage for a predetermined amount of time and at a predetermined temperature. Measurements of stress leakage currents and other parameters are taken to determine breakdown and failure conditions of the devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Stress driver circuits are typically used to apply a stress test voltage to the element or elements under test. An input test voltage is applied across buffer circuit elements, such as precision limiting resistors and readback sense circuits which provide information on actual applied voltage and leakage currents. The buffer elements, in turn, are connected to the elements under test. The test voltage is increased or adjusted until the voltage directly across the element(s) under test is precisely equal to the desired stress test voltage. Because resistors and other current carrying elements are used in the test circuitry, however, the voltage across the elements under test is often less than the input test voltage due to a voltage drop as leakage currents are passed through resistive elements. In addition, stress voltages simultaneously applied across a number of test elements may vary from element to element. Without a precise application of test parameters such as stress voltage, it becomes more difficult to fully understand the failure modes of devices subjected to stress conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is desirable, therefore, to provide a stress testing method and/or apparatus which addresses the abovementioned concerns. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary first embodiment of the invention, an apparatus for applying a stress voltage to a device under test includes a stress voltage source, a constant voltage circuit having an input connected to the stress voltage source and an output connected to the device under test. The constant voltage circuit provides a constant stress voltage to the device under test. There is also a control circuit which removes this voltage when the induced leakage current exceeds a predetermined level. A monitoring circuit measures the stress voltage applied to the device under test, and measures leakage current through the device under test. A switch has inputs connected to outputs of the monitoring circuit, with the switch being capable of sending a selected output or outputs of the monitoring circuit to a measurement system. Preferably, the constant voltage circuit is capable of providing a constant voltage source greater than 15 volts.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Referring initially to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> known system of applying a stress test voltage to a test device is shown. A stress voltage source <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> (typically a variable voltage source) is applied to a test device <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> or series of devices, such as MIM capacitors. The value of the stress voltage is adjusted until the desired voltage across the test devices <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is achieved. In order to limit leakage or short circuit current passing through the test devices <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, precision resistors <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are connected between the stress voltage source <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and each individual test device <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Stress currents passing through test devices <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> due to the application of stress voltage source <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be monitored or scanned one at a time by a scanning device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, which may include electromechanical relays (not shown). The scanning device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> selectively passes the stress voltage and leakage current information from each test device <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> on to a remote measurement system <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, which may include a computer controlled voltmeter (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> One problem associated with the above approach stems from the application of resistors <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Because there is a voltage drop across resistors <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> upon the onset of stress or leakage current passing through test devices <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the voltage measured directly at the test devices is no longer equal to the stress voltage value. Over time, the test devices will begin to break down and conduct short circuit current, thereby increasing the voltage drop across resistors <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. It will be appreciated that such a condition will result not only in decreased stress voltages applied to the test devices, but also varying and inconsistent stress voltages applied to each individual test device <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Without a constant source of stress voltage <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, uniformly applied to each test device <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, a proper analysis of the stress characteristics of the test devices <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is difficult to perform. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a block diagram of a constant voltage stressing system for test components, also known in the art. A stress voltage source <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is inputted to a series of constant voltage drivers <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, which provide a constant voltage output to a corresponding series of test devices <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>. The constant voltage drivers <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> typically include an instrumentation grade operational amplifier &ldquo;op-amp&rdquo; (not shown) with a precision resistor (not shown) in series with the output of the op-amp for current sensing and current limiting. The constant voltage drivers <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> hold the applied stress voltages at the test devices <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> constant and provide a buffer from the stress voltage source <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. Readback sense circuits <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> are also used to provide an accurate measurement of both the voltage applied at the test devices <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> and any leakage or stress current passing therethrough. These measurements are then typically sent to a solid state multiplexing device <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>, which selectively passes a measurement to a remote measuring system <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Although the system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> provides a constant stress test voltage to a device, the stress testing voltage range is generally limited by the operating supply voltage of the test circuitry. This is typically on the order of &plusmn;15 volts or less, meaning that the voltage driving, sensing and multiplexing functions are performed at &plusmn;10 volts or less. However, certain semiconductor devices, such as MIM capacitors, require stress test voltages in excess of 30 volts. As such, the prior art systems are inadequate for stress testing of higher voltage toleranced components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, an apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> for stress testing semiconductor devices in accordance with a first embodiment of the invention is shown. A stress voltage source <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is connected to a constant voltage circuit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, which includes a first operational amplifier <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> (op-amp) and a resistor <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> in series with the output <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> of first op-amp <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. First op-amp <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is preferably a high input impedance, high voltage FET-input operational amplifier, such as component number OPA445, manufactured by Burr-Brown Corporation. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the stress voltage source <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is connected to the non-inverting (&plus;) terminal of first op-amp <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. The inverting (&minus;) terminal of first op-amp <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is connected to the output <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> through resistor <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. Thus configured, first op-amp <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> provides a constant voltage output V<highlight><subscript>out </subscript></highlight>for application to a test device <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. It will be noted that if a stress leakage current is passed through resistor <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, a voltage drop will result across resistor <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> as V<highlight><subscript>out </subscript></highlight>rises. V<highlight><subscript>test </subscript></highlight>remains constant due to the feedback into the inverting (&minus;) terminal of first op-amp <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. This first embodiment is best utilized where the voltage associated with the input (and therefore output) of operational amplifier <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> does not approach the saturation voltage for the operational amplifier (V<highlight><subscript>sat</subscript></highlight>). Where the V<highlight><subscript>test </subscript></highlight>approaches V<highlight><subscript>sat</subscript></highlight>, a small amount of current flow through the test device, <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, will result in a drop in V<highlight><subscript>test </subscript></highlight>because V<highlight><subscript>out </subscript></highlight>cannot rise to a voltage greater than V<highlight><subscript>sat</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In a typical application, first op-amp <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is configured to operate with a power supply at &plusmn;45 volts, having corresponding input voltages ranging from &minus;40 to &plus;40 volts. In the first embodiment, however, the power supply voltages for first op-amp are shifted to &plus;85 volts and &minus;5 volts, thereby accommodating a range of input stress voltages from 0 to 80 volts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In addition to constant voltage circuit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, a &ldquo;readback&rdquo;, or monitoring circuit <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is also provided for monitoring the value of the actual applied stress voltage V<highlight><subscript>test</subscript></highlight>, as well as the value of the leakage current drawn by test device <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, monitoring circuit <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> includes a second op-amp <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> and a third op-amp <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, both of which are configured as voltage followers by having their respective outputs connected directly to the non-inverting (&minus;) terminals thereof. The output <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> of the second op-amp <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> is a buffered reproduction of V<highlight><subscript>out</subscript></highlight>, just as the output <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> of the third op-amp <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> is a buffered reproduction of V<highlight><subscript>test</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> A pair of differential amplifiers, fourth op-amp <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> and fifth op-amp <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>, generate outputs <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> corresponding to the leakage current through resistor <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and to the voltage applied to the test device V<highlight><subscript>test</subscript></highlight>, respectively. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, fourth op-amp <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> has its non-inverting terminal (&plus;) connected to output <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> of second op amp <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, which is the buffered reproduction of V<highlight><subscript>out</subscript></highlight>. The inverting terminal (&minus;) of fourth op-amp <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> is connected to output <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> of third op-amp <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, which is the buffered reproduction of V<highlight><subscript>test</subscript></highlight>. A network of equally valued 60 k&Ugrave;, precision resistors are used to adjust the gain of fourth op-amp <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> such that its output <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> represents the difference between V<highlight><subscript>out </subscript></highlight>and V<highlight><subscript>test</subscript></highlight>, amplified at unity gain. It should be understood that other resistance values may be used in conjunction with fourth op-amp <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. Thus, it can be seen that if test device <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> begins to pass a leakage current through resistor <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, the voltage drop across resistor <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> will result in a difference between V<highlight><subscript>out </subscript></highlight>and V<highlight><subscript>test</subscript></highlight>, reflected at output <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>. Output <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>, in turn can be used to determine the value of the leakage current through resistor <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, depending on the value of resistor <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Fifth op-amp <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> is also used as a differential amplifier. The non-inverting (&plus;) terminal thereof is connected to output <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> of third op-amp which, again, is the buffered reproduction of V<highlight><subscript>test</subscript></highlight>. The inverting(&minus;) terminal of fifth op-amp <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> is connected to ground. As is the case with fourth op-amp <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, a network of equally valued 60 k&Ugrave;, precision resistors is also used to adjust the gain of fifth op-amp <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> such that its output <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> represents the difference between V<highlight><subscript>test </subscript></highlight>and ground, amplified at unity gain. Again, it is understood that other resistance values may be used. Output <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>, therefore represents the value of V<highlight><subscript>test</subscript></highlight>, the voltage actually applied to test device <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> A series of high input impedance, constant voltage circuits <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> may be combined with a series of monitoring circuits <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> to apply stress test voltage <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> to a series of corresponding test devices <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. For each device tested, there will be three outputs generated. First, the test voltage V<highlight><subscript>test </subscript></highlight>is generated by constant voltage circuit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, adjusted to its desired value, and then applied to the device under test. Second, output <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> represents the amount of leakage current drawn by device <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> through resistor <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. Third, output <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> represents the actual value of V<highlight><subscript>test</subscript></highlight>. Outputs <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> may then be multiplexed and sent to a measurement system, as described hereinafter. It should also be noted that the power supplies of each op-amp shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> are shifted to &plus;85 volts and &minus;5 volts, for the reasons indicated above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> first embodiment of the invention is shown wherein eight channels <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> (numbered 0 through 7) each represent a combination of the constant voltage circuit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and the monitoring circuit <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. Stress voltage source <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is applied as an input to each channel <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> which, as described above, provides three outputs: the test voltage V<highlight><subscript>test </subscript></highlight>and outputs <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> As mentioned previously, outputs <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> (representing the leakage current through a selected test device <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and the applied voltage to the device <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>) may be sent to a multiplexing device for selective input to a remote measurement system. In the present embodiment, a pair of dual high voltage analog switches <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> are used to perform the multiplexing function on outputs <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> for each channel <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. Analog switch <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is preferably a dual, 1 of 4 high voltage analog switch, such as component number HV20720, manufactured by Supertex, Inc. While each switch <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is normally configured to provide a pair of (1 to 4) multiplexed outputs, it may be configured to provide a single (1 of 8) multiplexed output. In the first embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, each analog switch <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> receives input from four separate channels <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, with each channel <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> providing two inputs <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> thereto. Further, each analog switch <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> has three digital control inputs <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> which control the selected output <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates the multiplexing function of an individual analog switch <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. Switch <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> has dual 1 to 4 decoders <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, designated &ldquo;A&rdquo; and &ldquo;B&rdquo;, each of which are operated by three logic bit input pins <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> (designated by A<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, CLA and B<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, CLB, respectively). Correspondingly, each decoder has a set of four analog output switches <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, designated by SW<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>A through SW<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A and SW<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>B through SW<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>B. As shown in the truth table of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the switch <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is normally designed such that for each decoder <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, only one of the four output switches <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> can be closed at a given time. However, if the &ldquo;clear&rdquo; bit (CLA or CLB) is high, then all four switches will remain open. Thus, it can be seen how both decoders in a given switch <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> can be made to work together to form a single 1 to 8 decoder. By providing inverted inputs to CLA and CLB (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>), only one set (A or B) of output switches <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> may be activated at a given time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The power supplied to the analog switches at V<highlight><subscript>pp </subscript></highlight>and V<highlight><subscript>nn </subscript></highlight>shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, is preferably set at &plus;95 V and &minus;48 V, respectively, for compatibility with the constant voltage and monitoring circuits <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> of channels <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Referring once again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, it can be seen that for each set of four channels <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> used in the stress testing process, an analog switch <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> wired in an <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> multiplexer configuration is used. Therefore, when multiple corresponding multiplexed outputs <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> exist, additional levels of multiplexing <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight> may be used as required. It will be appreciated that the aforementioned first embodiment may be repeated as often as necessary until the desired number of selected outputs are sent to a remote measurement system <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. Measurement system <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> may be, for example, a computer controlled voltmeter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As introduced supra, the first embodiment as described operates best where the Vtest does not approach or exceed Vsat However, where Vtest does approach Vsat the use of the first embodiment is limited as the circuit as described will not allow a constant voltage stress to continue beyond a small amount of leakage current through the test device. This limitation becomes more significant when devices such as MIM (metal insulator metal) capacitors need to be tested and stressed, because this is performed at higher voltages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> These conditions exist because the resistor <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is used to accomplish two ends, first to sense the current flowing through the test device and second to limit the current flowing through the test device. Resistor <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is usually a precision resistor that is used to sense the load current. Any current flowing into the inverting input of the operational amplifier is orders of magnitude lower than that of the current flowing through the load and may be ignored. Therefore it may be assumed that all of the load current lows through resistor, R<highlight><subscript>sense</subscript></highlight>, <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. The voltage drop across R<highlight><subscript>sense </subscript></highlight>can be measured and the load current calculated by dividing this voltage by the known sense resistance: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>I</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>load</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&equals;V</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>Rsense</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>/R</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>sense </subscript></highlight></in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> R<highlight><subscript>sense </subscript></highlight>is also used to limit the load current in the event that the load should short. In this case, the operational amplifier will saturate and its output will go as high as V<highlight><subscript>sat</subscript></highlight>, while the voltage at the test device will go to zero. The short circuit current is calculated as: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>I</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>short</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&equals;V</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>sat</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>/R</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>sense </subscript></highlight></in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> There is a third implication to the value chosen for R<highlight><subscript>sense</subscript></highlight>. The driver circuit shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is intended to be a constant voltage driver. There is a limitation to the amount of current the driver can provide, while still being expected to maintain a constant voltage (V<highlight><subscript>test</subscript></highlight>) at the test device. As the test device begins to leak (the test device current rises) V<highlight><subscript>test </subscript></highlight>at the test device is kept constant by feedback and V<highlight><subscript>out </subscript></highlight>rises until it reaches V<highlight><subscript>sat </subscript></highlight>(saturation). Any increase in the test device leakage current beyond this point will cause the stress voltage at the test device to drop. This limiting condition can be expressed as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><subscript>Iconstant voltage</subscript></highlight>&equals;(<highlight><italic>V</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>sat</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&minus;V</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>test</subscript></highlight>)/<highlight><italic>R</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>sense </subscript></highlight></in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In order to allow a usable value for I<highlight><subscript>constant voltage</subscript></highlight>, the equation above shows that R<highlight><subscript>sense </subscript></highlight>must be reduced. Keeping the same design, if the R<highlight><subscript>sense </subscript></highlight>is reduced then the maximum leakage current I<highlight><subscript>short </subscript></highlight>would also rise. This higher allowable short circuit current could add cost and complexity to stress systems and would allow greater amounts of damage to potentially be caused to the stressed device. One would like to keep I<highlight><subscript>constant voltage </subscript></highlight>high and I<highlight><subscript>short </subscript></highlight>low. These are conflicting design considerations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The design conflicts identified above are solved by the second embodiment of the invention where the sense resistor for the test device is used for current sensing only. A different mechanism is used for current limiting as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the function of leakage current limiting is performed by the control circuit, <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. The control circuit senses the voltage across the sense resistor (between points X and Y) and controls a relay which switches the load on the driver from the test device, <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, to a dummy load, <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> when a predetermined value of leakage current has been exceeded. Current is thereby removed from the load when it reaches a predetermined maximum value and the current drawn through the test device is limited. Since the current is removed at a predetermined value and not just limited, the test device is not exposed to excessive current loads and will not be physically degraded and can undergo physical failure analysis. The dummy load should be configured such that it draws at least enough current to keep in the &ldquo;tripped&rdquo; state, insuring that the test device stays off line until the stress voltage is removed, at which point it may automatically reset itself. If desirable for the tester, the reference voltage generator may be capable of varying the reference voltage. This would allow control of the maximum current allowed to flow through the device for each individual test. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> An example of a control circuit is given in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the output of operational amplifier, <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is connected to monitoring circuitry, <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight>, in this embodiment. The exemplary control circuitry includes a reference voltage generator, <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>, which determines the maximum current load that can occur before tripping the relay. The outputs of the voltage generator, <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>, are compared by comparators, <highlight><bold>425</bold></highlight>, and the result will cause the tripping of the relay when the current exceeds the predetermined value and the dummy load, <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>, will receive the current. The voltage to the test device, <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, will be zero when the predetermined value is exceeded. In the instant example the dummy load, <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>, consist of a resistor of sufficient ohmage to ensure that the test device, <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, remains off line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The layout of the second embodiment lends itself to multiplexer of FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The output of the monitoring circuit <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is analogous to the output of the monitoring circuit in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> at point <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>. The output of the monitoring circuit, <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is analogous to the output of the monitoring circuit in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> at point <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that certain filtering elements, <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>, may be added to the circuit to achieve the individual designer circuit design. The inventor contemplated this and an example of filters that might be used are included in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> By providing a constant stress voltage source and parameter monitoring capability when stress testing certain high voltage semiconductor components, such as MIM capacitors, the aforementioned drawbacks may be overcome. While the invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes may be made and equivalents may be substituted for elements thereof without departing from the scope of the invention. In addition, many modifications may be made to adapt a particular situation or material to the teachings of the invention without departing from the essential scope thereof. Therefore, it is intended that the invention not be limited to the particular embodiment disclosed as the best mode contemplated for carrying out this invention, but that the invention will include all embodiments falling within the scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
