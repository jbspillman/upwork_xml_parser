<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to verification and registration of items containing digitally embedded information. More particularly, the invention relates to system and method for validating, registering, cataloging, trading, and interacting with digitally embedded items such as digitally embedded collectible trading cards over the Internet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Collectible trading cards are well-known and have been popular for many years, especially in the field of sports. Typically, the trading card includes a photograph of a sports player on one side and the player&apos;s performance statistics on the other side. Such cards are sold, collected, and traded by collectors and vendors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Traditionally, the trading cards are manufactured out of paper. Due to the ease with which a paper product can be reproduced, the traditional trading card industry has faced forgery problems for years. Therefore, the traders and the buyers have had to risk that their newly acquired cards were not authentic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the cards are typically sold or traded in a face-to-face interaction between a seller and a buyer. The necessity of a face-to-face interaction between a seller and a buyer limited the potential market to which a seller could offer the cards for sale and from which a buyer can search for a particular card he/she desires. The forum in which most of the buying, selling, and trading activities took place were the vendor shops, trade shows, hobby clubs, and among friends and acquaintances. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> With the widespread popularity of the Internet and the accompanying technology, some attempts have been made to incorporate the newly available technology into the trading card industry. Such attempts include recording player&apos;s performance statistics on a bar code or substituting either a floppy disk or an optical disk as the trading card. The problems of forgery were not addressed. Additionally, the substitution of either a floppy or the optical disks was not desirable since the traditional look and feel of the trading cards were missing. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The preferred embodiments of the present invention provide systems and methods for verifying, registering, cataloging, interacting, and trading various items with digitally embedded information over the Internet. These embodiments enable the verification of a collectible trading card. As in the case of any collectible item, a factor that often affects the value of the trading card is the ownership history associated with the card. A feature of this invention is providing a system and method to track the identity of previous owners of a collectible card. Being able to track the ownership history of the collectible card substantially enhances the trading and the ownership experience. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The system and method are implemented by software running on the client side and the service provider side. Through the service provider&apos;s web site, a user can perform various available options. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> While the various examples are described using digitally embedded cards e.g., smart cards, it is contemplated that the invention be implemented for any item such as collectible dolls, toys, automobiles, et cetera, containing digitally embedded information. Accordingly, it is to be understood that the invention is not to be limited by the specific illustrated examples, but only by the scope of the claims. It is contemplated that the system and method disclosed herein may be implemented using any digitally embedded items. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> As noted above, one feature of the preferred embodiment offers a user the option to verify the authenticity of the smart collectible trading cards (SCTC). Using the digital authenticity data comprising, for example, digital serial number and digital key located within the memory device such as an EPROM on the SCTC, the authenticity of the SCTC is verified. The user has an option of adding the SCTC to the service provider&apos;s master catalog. Registering the SCTC, places the SCTC in an active state within the service providers&apos; master catalog. Placing the SCTC in an active state can enable various functionalities. For example, active status can enable on-line trading of the SCTC. On-line trading option reaches interested parties around the world using the Internet. Any interested party can verify authenticity before actual transactions occur. After the transaction, the acquiring party can add the acquired SCTC to his/her own catalog, automatically eliminating it from the previous owner&apos;s catalog. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Another feature of a preferred embodiment of the invention is to provide the user with ability to interact with other users using the SCTC. The user can engage in on-line multiplayer games, fantasy sports and other forms of on-line activities. The SCTC can be used in an offline format at any time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Still another advantage of the preferred embodiment of the invention is that the users with validated, registered SCTC&apos;s can catalog and manage their SCTCs, using any criteria, in an on-line environment. Cataloging and managing SCTCs can help maintain an organized on-line environment and can facilitate utilizing other aspects of the service provider&apos;s web site. Trading SCTC using the on-line cataloging system allows interested parties to view the user&apos;s complete collection, if the user so desires. The cataloging and managing feature enables a user to customize the layout his/her SCTC on-line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the user can advantageously catalog and manage the SCTC in a way that best suits his/her viewing preference. The user&apos;s viewing preference may be altered depending on whether he/she is viewing the SCTCs for trading purposes or on-line gaming purposes. An additional option available to users includes maintaining SCTC ownership history. This ownership history feature facilitates valuation of any particular SCTC since the ownership history, as well as rarity or demand, would dictate the value of the SCTC. Such tracking also helps cut down on illegal duplication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Other options available to the user include trading and playing on-line games. With all of the SCTCs from different users stored in the database, users can choose to take part in a massive trading program that also includes buying and selling of the SCTCs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The user can also take part in various on-line multi-player card games using the SCTCs. The games can consist of unlimited number of players and can have full text communication along with fall graphics. The rules of the game as well as the difficulty level of the game are modifiable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> This invention eliminates illegal duplication of collectible cards by merging smart card technology into collectible cards. Even if a SCTC was duplicated with an embedded EPROM, the SCTC could not be verified with a central repository at the service provider&apos;s database because the verification of the authenticity encompasses comparing the data stored at the central repository to which the fraudulent manufacturer does not have access. Furthermore, if the SCTC was duplicated with a counterfeit digital ID the member holding the genuine ID could simply re-insert their SCTC to regain possession of that ID. Moreover, any such persistent problem could be addressed by deleting the problematic ID and replacing the breached SCTC.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In the following description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof and which show, by way of illustration, specific embodiments or processes in which the invention may be practiced. In some instances, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. The invention, however, may be practiced without the specific details or with certain alternative equivalent devices or components and methods to those described herein. In other instances, well-known methods and devices or components have not been described in detail so as not to unnecessarily obscure aspects of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As indicated previously, while the various examples are described using smart cards, it is contemplated that the system and method described may be implemented for any items containing digitally embedded data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Collectible cards are ubiquitous and their popularity continues to grow even in today&apos;s digital society. A way of introducing the collectible card into the digital world is to integrate smart card technology. A memory component such as an erasable programmable read only memory (EPROM) chip embedded in the collectible card allows the collector to validate, catalog and interact on-line with their collectible card via a computer linked to reader capable of reading the data stored on the memory component of the card. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Using the Internet, the preferred embodiment of the invention enables the collectible card industry to achieve new levels of interactivity. The traditional collectible card offers very limited interaction between it and its owner. Additionally, most card games require physical cards in order to play games, at a common physical location in a face-to-face interaction. On the other hand, using the trading cards of the preferred embodiment with embedded memory component such as an EPROM, a player can play on-line games with players located at another location. The collector is now able to play the same strategy or fantasy sports collectible card games with others over the Internet with remotely located players. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The ability to identify the cards on-line enables the collector to inventory, manage and arrange the cards using criteria that best accommodates the collector. Establishing both physical and virtual card catalogs enables the collector to participate in on-line and/or offline trading and game playing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The present invention describes the merging of smart card technology with the collectible trading card. Together, the smart card and collectible trading card create a new way of interacting with the communication mediums such as the Internet. As described elsewhere herein, various refinements and substitutions of the various embodiments are possible based on principles and teachings herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates an example implementation of the overall system <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>A according to one embodiment of the invention. The system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> comprises a smart trading card <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>A, a card reader <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, a card reader connection <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>B, a user computer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, a connection <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>A, the Internet <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, a connection <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>B, and a server <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The card reader <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is connected to the user computer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> by the connection <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>B. The user computer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the server <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> are connected to the Internet <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> by the connection <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>A and the connection <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>B, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The smart trading card <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> further comprises a memory component such as an EPROM. The memory component stores digital data. The information stored in the memory component can be used for various purposes including validating and registering the smart trading card <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>A on-line with the server <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> via the Internet <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The user computer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> further comprises a CPU, a hard drive, a monitor, a compact disk read-only memory (CD ROM) drive, a keyboard, a mouse, and the connection <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> illustrates an example implementation of the smart trading card <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>A. Smart cards are typically about the size of a credit card and contain a small amount of memory and sometimes a processor. The original premise of smart cards was for them to be used in financial applications similar to a credit card or bank ATM card. However, smart cards have gained in popularity for other applications. In Europe, they are used for varying applications including public transportation, identification and food payment applications for university students, and parking tolls, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The example smart trading card <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>A illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> is 85.6 mm in length and 53.97 mm in width. The front edge of the memory component <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, in this example an EPROM, sits 9 mm back from the end inserted into the card reader <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and 22 mm from the back edge of the EPROM. The right edge of the EPROM sits 18 mm from the right side of the card when it is face up with EPROM exposed and 29 mm from the left edge of the EPROM. The corners of the EPROM card are a 6.35 radius. The EPROM <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can have varying storage capacity. For example, the memory capacity of the EPROM <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can range from 16 bits to 1 megabyte. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the card containing the digital data may be implemented using a global system for mobile communications (GSM) card, similar to those used with the cellular telephones. Moreover, the item containing the digital data may not be in the form of a card at all. As indicated previously, the item containing the digital data may be any item containing the digitally embedded data such as a collectible doll with digitally embedded data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The smart trading card <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>A can also include graphical displays on the card itself such as original art, much like a traditional collectible trading card thereby increasing the card value beyond just the technological makeup of the smart card. The card is used in conjunction with the card reader <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. Moreover, special edition cards such as seasonal cards and limited editions cards can provide further variety to the artwork included on the cards <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference> illustrates an example implementation of the card reader <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. The example card reader <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference> includes a slot <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on the front into which the smart card <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>A is inserted and a card reader connection <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>B to attach the card reader <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to the user computer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The card reader <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> can be connected to the user computer by various methods. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference> illustrates a connection method <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>B using a cable. Using a cable, the card reader <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> can be connected to, for example, a serial or a universal serial bus (USB) port of the user computer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The card reader can connect to the user&apos;s computer by other connection methods as well. For example, the card reader <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> may be installed internally to the user computer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The card reader <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> can also be integrated into the keyboard of the user computer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the reader of the digital data such as those stored in the memory device of the item may not be connected to the user&apos;s computer at all. For example, the reader of the digital data embedded in a collectible doll, for example, may be a wireless radio proximity reader. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> To begin tasks associated with the smart trading card <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>A, the user inserts the card <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>A into the slot <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on the card reader <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the Internet <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is used as the communication medium via which the information between the user computer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the server <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is exchanged. Although the Internet <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is shown as the communication medium between the user computer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the server in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, any form of global networking to exchange information may be used.
