<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention generally relates to liquid crystal display (LCD) and integrated circuit (IC) fabrication and, more particularly, to a silicon film and fabrication process to laser irradiate silicon film in making polycrystalline silicon thin film transistors (TFTs) for Active Matrix (AM) LCDs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Lateral crystallization by excimer-laser anneal (LC-ELA) is a desirable method for forming high quality polycrystalline silicon films having large and uniform grains. Further, this process permits precise control of the grain boundary locations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>through <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>illustrate steps in an LC-ELA annealing process (prior art). As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, initially amorphous silicon film <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is irradiated by a laser beam that is shaped by an appropriate mask to an array of narrow &ldquo;beamlets&rdquo;. The shape of the beamlets can vary. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, each beamlet is shaped as a straight slit of narrow width, approximately 3-5 microns (&mgr;m). This slit is represented in the figures as the two heavy lines. The width of the slit is the distance between these two lines. This width can vary, but ultimately it is dependent upon the attainable lateral growth length (LGL), which is defined as the distance crystals can grow laterally (inwardly) from the edges of the irradiated area. Typically, the beamlet width is designed to be slightly less than twice the corresponding LGL. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The sequence of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>illustrates the growth of long polysilicon grains by LC-ELA process. A step-and-repeat approach is used. The laser beamlet width (indicated by the 2 parallel, heavy black lines) irradiates the film and, then steps a distance (d), to point <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, smaller than half of the lateral growth length (L), i.e. d&lt;L/2. Using this step-and-repeat process, it is possible to continually grow crystal grains from the point of the initial irradiation, to the point where the irradiation steps cease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is partial cross-sectional view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>illustrating the topography of laser-irradiated domains (prior art). After the completion of the lateral growth, the two crystal fronts meet at the center of the domain <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> where explosive nucleation occurs. The stepping distance of the beam is a crucial factor in the process throughput and, hence, the economics of the LC-ELA process in mass productions. The stepping distance, in turn, is dependent upon the lateral growth length (LGL). LGL is affected by the transient temperature profile of the film, which defines the time for the lateral propagation of the two facing crystal fronts, before the remaining molten volume becomes cold enough to trigger copious (explosive) nucleation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It would be desirable to improve the lateral growth length (LGL) during crystallization. Such improvement would enable an increase of the stepping distance between successive shots. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It would be advantageous if the melt duration of the laser-irradiated volume of silicon film could be increased, to gain a corresponding increase in the LGL. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The present invention is a method that prolongs the melt duration during the laser irradiation of the silicon film, thereby increasing the lateral growth length (LGL). The increase in the melt duration is achieved by controlled manipulation of the pulse duration of the laser irradiation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, a method is provided for crystallizing a silicon film in LCD fabrication. The method comprises: forming an amorphous silicon film having a thickness in the range of 100 to 1000 Angstroms (&angst;); irradiating the silicon film with a laser pulse having a pulse width of 30 nanoseconds (ns) or greater, as measured at the full-width-half-maximum (FWHM); and, in response to irradiating the silicon film, melting the silicon film to promote the lateral growth of crystal grains. Irradiating the silicon film with a laser pulse having a pulse width of 30 ns or greater includes irradiating with a pulse having a pulse width in the range between 30 and 300 ns FWHM, and an energy density in the range from 200 to 1300 millijoules per square centimeter (mJ/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>). </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a graph illustrating a plot of LGL as a function of silicon film thickness, laser energy density, and laser pulse duration. As shown, LGL increases with the applied energy density. However, the energy density cannot be increased indefinitely, as silicon film evaporates in response to exposure to high laser energy density values. The range of pulse durations, for a film thickness of 450 &angst;, represents the boundaries within which the energy density can reasonably be varied. Outside these ranges the film either does not completely melt (below the minimum point) or evaporates (above the maximum point). Note, the pulse widths and energy density values vary in response to the film thickness. A thickness of 450 &angst; is provided as an example of pulse duration and energy density values. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> One method of increasing the LGL involves increasing pulse durations. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, an increase in pulse duration from approximately 30 ns (nominal) to approximately 180 ns can drastically increase the LGL. This LGL increase is more substantial for thicker films. Nonetheless, even for thinner films with thicknesses of less than 45 nanometers (nm), a LGL of greater than 3 microns can be reasonably expected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that pulse durations of greater than 180 ns can be achieved using existing technology. Commercial excimer lasers currently exist, such as the XeCl excimer laser made by the French company SOPRA, S.A., capable of delivering pulses of up to approximately 240 ns in duration Full-Width-Half-Maximum (FWHM). Hence, the experimental results depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, are achievable in mass production LCD fabrication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>illustrate pulse width durations applicable to the present invention pulse width crystallization method. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>depicts a pulse of duration of approximately 28 ns, as measured at FWHM). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>depicts a pulse duration of approximately 280 ns, as measured at FWHM. Both pulse durations were produced from an XeCl (308 nm) excimer laser. A digital oscilloscope was used to capture the pulse duration, in each case. </paragraph>
