<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to semiconductor manufacturing, and more particularly to an apparatus for detecting the presence of a carrier in which semiconductor substrates are stored and/or transported. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Semiconductor devices are made on substrates, such as silicon wafers or glass plates, for use in computers, monitors, and the like. These devices are made by a sequence of fabrication steps, such as thin film deposition, oxidation or nitration, etching, polishing, and thermal and lithographic processing. Although multiple fabrication steps may be performed in a single processing station, substrates must be transported between processing stations for at least some of the fabrication steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Substrates are stored in open cassettes or sealed pods (hereinafter referred to collectively as &ldquo;substrate carriers&rdquo;) for transfer between processing stations and other locations. Although substrate carriers may be carried manually between processing stations, the transfer of substrate carriers is typically automated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Placement of a substrate carrier precisely at a predetermined position and alignment on a processing station or storage location may be of critical importance, particularly when the substrate carrier is to be removed from the processing station or storage location by an automated device, or when a substrate-handling robot is to remove substrates from the substrate carrier. To accommodate the need for precise and automatic placement of substrate carriers at processing stations and storage locations, an organization referred to as &ldquo;SEMI&rdquo; (Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International) has prescribed standards for three locator or alignment pins to be provided on processing stations or storage locations, and for corresponding slots provided on the bottom of substrate carriers. Locator pins and carrier slots provided in accordance with this standard operate to kinematically position substrate carriers in a precise and predetermined manner on processing stations or storage locations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is also known to provide sensors adjacent to the locator pins to allow for automatic detection of the presence of a substrate carrier at a processing station or storage location. The sensors are also employed to detect failure of the substrate carrier to seat properly on the locator pins. Because there are a number of ways in which a substrate carrier may be improperly positioned relative to the three locator pins called for by the SEMI standard, conventional practice to accurately determine positive carrier placement calls for providing at least five sensors at various positions near the three locator pins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It would be desirable to provide an arrangement in which proper positioning of a substrate carrier on the three locator pins can be reliably detected using fewer than five sensors. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The invention comprises a wafer carrier locating pin having an integrated wafer carrier sensor. According to an aspect of the invention, the apparatus includes a surface adapted to receive the substrate carrier and a pin body mounted on, and extending upwardly from, the surface. The pin body has a slot formed therein. The apparatus also includes a paddle mounted in the slot of the pin body. The paddle is adapted to be actuated in a downward direction when the substrate carrier is seated on the pin body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The pin body may have an uppermost point, and the paddle may be movable between a first position and a second position, with the paddle being held in the first position when no substrate carrier is present. According to this aspect of the invention, the paddle does not extend above the uppermost point of the pin body when the paddle is in the first position. The paddle may extend horizontally outwardly in two directions from the uppermost point of the pin body when the paddle is in the first position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The pin body may have a rounded top and the paddle may be arranged so that it does not extend above any portion of the rounded top of the pin body when the paddle is in the second position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The apparatus may further include a plunger held inside the pin body and coupled to the paddle for movement in a downward direction when the paddle is actuated. There may also be included in the apparatus a through-beam sensor mounted below the shelf. The through-beam sensor projects a beam that is adapted to be broken by a lower end of the plunger when the paddle is actuated. The apparatus may further include a spring adapted to bias the plunger and the paddle in an upward direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment of the invention, a through-beam sensor may be mounted adjacent the pin body in a recess of the surface. An actuator may be coupled to the paddle and adapted to break a beam of the through-beam sensor when the paddle is actuated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the invention, a station for receiving a substrate carrier is provided. The station includes a surface and three pins mounted on the surface. The three pins define a circle having a center point and each of the pins has a paddle mounted thereon. The paddles are actuatable by a substrate carrier placed on the surface and each paddle is substantially planar and defines a respective plane. Each paddle is mounted on the respective pin such that the plane defined by the paddle is substantially perpendicular to a line extending between the respective pin and the center point of the circle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> By integrating a carrier-sensing device with each locator pin, and arranging the sensing devices such that the sensing devices are actuated only when the pin is correctly engaged in the corresponding slot on the bottom of the carrier, the present invention permits reliable sensing of the correct positioning of the substrate carrier while, in one embodiment, using only three sensors. Thus, in this embodiment the sensing capabilities of a processing station or storage location may be provided at lower cost than conventional substrate carrier sensing arrangements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Further features and advantages of the present invention will become more fully apparent from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments, the appended claims and the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is an isometric view, from above, of a station <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> provided to receive and sense the presence of a substrate carrier in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. The station <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be, for example, either one of a processing station at which substrates are removed from the substrate carrier, or a storage location at which a substrate carrier may be stored. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The station <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a substantially planar shelf <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which is adapted to receive a substrate carrier. Mounted on the shelf <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and extending upwardly therefrom, are three locator pins <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The locator pins <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are positioned with respect to each other, and have a height and width, in accordance with the above-mentioned SEMI standard. Also, as will be discussed below, each locator pin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is integrated with a sensor for detecting the presence of a substrate carrier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> An angle bracket <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is mounted at one side of the shelf <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A beam emitter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is mounted near the top of the angle bracket <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and in a position above and offset to a side of the shelf <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. An L-shaped window <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is formed in the shelf <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at a side opposite to the angle bracket <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In accordance with conventional practice, the L-shaped window <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is provided to allow the beam (not shown) from the beam emitter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to be received by a beam receiver (not shown) mounted on the lower side of the shelf <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The beam emitter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and beam receiver together form a conventional arrangement for generally detecting the presence or absence of a substrate carrier at the shelf <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. As will be seen, the sensors integrated with the locator pins <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> provide an indication of whether the substrate carrier is accurately positioned on the shelf <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The shelf <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> also has formed therein a large opening <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> located at a central position relative to the locator pins <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The opening <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> aids in aligning the shelf <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> during installation thereof, and also reduces the weight of the shelf <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a bottom plan view of a conventional substrate carrier <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The substrate carrier <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may be of the type referred to as a front-opening unified pod (FOUP). The substrate carrier <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is constructed in accordance with the SEMI standard and is adapted to be positioned on the shelf <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A bottom surface <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the substrate carrier <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> includes three slots <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> which have a V-shaped cross section. Slots <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> have respective longitudinal axes in the directions indicated by arrows <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. The slots <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> cooperate with the locator pins <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, when the substrate carrier <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is placed on the shelf <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, to kinematically position the substrate carrier <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> with correct alignment at an appropriate place on the shelf <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is an exploded view of a typical one of the locator pins <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, showing a sensor mechanism that is integrated with the locator pin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The locator pin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> includes a pin body <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> adapted to be mounted by its base <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in a hole <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> formed in the shelf <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The pin body <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has an upper portion <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> which includes a rounded top <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and a vertically extending slot <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The external configuration of the pin body <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> conforms to the SEMI standard for locator pins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The integrated locator pin/sensor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> also includes a generally planar paddle <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> which is shaped and sized to fit in the slot <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the pin body <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The paddle <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> has a flat top edge <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and adjoining cut corners <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The flat top edge <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is so the carrier cannot be set on the pins incorrectly and still actuate the sensor. The flat cut corners coincide with the outside shape of the pin body <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and interact with the carrier in the same fashion as a bare pin with no slot would. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> A plunger <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is adapted to be held inside the pin body <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and coupled to the paddle <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, so as to be moved downwardly when the paddle <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is actuated (moved downwardly) by a substrate carrier seated on the pin body <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. As will be seen, a lower end <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the plunger <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is positioned to interrupt a beam of a through-beam sensor <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> when the paddle <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is actuated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> A coil spring <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is provided to upwardly bias the plunger <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and paddle <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to an unactuated position. Like the plunger <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the coil spring <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is received within the pin body <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. A cap <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is fitted into a counter bore (not shown) in a lower surface of the shelf <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The cap <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> has threads (not shown) which cooperate with threads (not shown) on the base <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the pin body <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to secure the pin body <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to the shelf <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The above-mentioned through-beam sensor <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> may be a conventional device, and may be, for example, a model PM.K <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, manufactured by Sun.X Inc. As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the through-beam sensor <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is mounted below the shelf <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> adjacent a lower end <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the plunger <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, which extends downwardly below the lower surface <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the shelf <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Referring once more to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the through-beam sensor <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> has prongs <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> between which a beam <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is projected. (The beam <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> but is seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, it will be seen that the rounded top <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of the pin body <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has an uppermost point <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. The paddle <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is shown in its unactuated position in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>; i.e. in the position in which the paddle <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is held when no substrate carrier is present. When the paddle <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is in its unactuated position, the top edge <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the paddle <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is in a tangential relationship with the uppermost point <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of the rounded pin body <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In other words, the paddle <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> does not extend above the uppermost point <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of the pin body <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, but does extend horizontally outwardly in a rightward direction and a leftward direction from the uppermost point <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of the pin body <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. This configuration again precludes a carrier or any other item from setting atop the pins and giving a false carrier placed status. Only when the cut corners engage a slot in the carrier will the pin operate as designed. If the carrier were rotated slightly, and the corner of the slot were placed on the cut corner of the paddle, the slope of the cut corner would allow the carrier to slide off either into a placed condition or not. But the sensor would be able to make an accurate determination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The orientations of the paddles <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the three locator pins <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> relative to the shelf <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> will now be discussed with reference once more to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. It will be observed from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> that the three locator pins <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> define a circle having a center point located at A in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Each paddle <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is mounted in its respective locator pin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and oriented such that the plane defined by the respective paddle <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is substantially perpendicular to a line that may be drawn from point A to the respective locator pin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. In other words, it may be said that the paddles <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> face the central point A of the circle defined by the locator pins <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, it will be appreciated that the lines which may be drawn from point A in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> to the pins <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> will coincide with the longitudinal axes (represented by arrows <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) of the slots <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the substrate carrier <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> when the substrate carrier <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is properly positioned relative to the locator pins <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Consequently, when the wafer carrier <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is properly seated on the locator pins <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the planes of the paddles <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> will each be perpendicular to the sloping sides of the corresponding one of the slots <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the substrate carrier <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, it will be recognized that the orientations of the paddles <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are optimized for the paddles <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to be engaged by the slots <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the substrate carrier <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> when the substrate carrier <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is positioned on the locator pins <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates an alternative embodiment of the invention, in which the through-beam sensor <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is not mounted below the shelf <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Rather, as seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the through-beam sensor <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is mounted in a recess <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> formed in an upper surface <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the shelf <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. An advantage of the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is that no space is taken up by the through-beam sensor <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> below the shelf <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, so that the overall vertical profile of the arrangement is reduced, and shelves may be spaced at a closer spacing in the vertical direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Continuing to refer to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the paddle <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>&prime; is integrally formed with an L-shaped actuator <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. The actuator <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> has a horizontal extension <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> that enters a gap <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> between prongs <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of the through-beam sensor <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The horizontal extension <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is below the top surface of shelf <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> so as to preclude false actuation. When the paddle <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>&prime; is actuated by a substrate carrier seated on the pin body <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>&prime;, the paddle <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>&prime;, its integral actuator <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, and the horizontal extension <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> all move downwardly, causing the horizontal extension <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> to interrupt a beam (not shown) projected in the gap <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> between the prongs <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of the through-beam sensor <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In operation, the integrated locator pins/substrate carrier sensors may be either in an unactuated condition or in an actuated condition. When no substrate carrier is present, the integrated locator pins/substrate carrier sensors are in an unactuated condition as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The paddle <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and plunger <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are biased in an upward direction by spring <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The paddle <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of each locator pin/sensor extends horizontally outwardly relative to the uppermost point <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of the pin body <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, but does not extend above the uppermost point <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> so as to preclude false actuation. The lower end <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the plunger <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> extends below the shelf <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, but does not extend downwardly far enough to interrupt the beam <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of the through-beam sensor <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> When a substrate carrier is seated on the pins <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the sides of slots <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) engage the top edges <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and/or the cut corners <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of the paddles <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, actuating the paddles and moving the paddles downward against the biasing force of the spring <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). In the case of each pin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the respective plunger <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is also moved downward so that the lower end <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the plunger <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> breaks the beam <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of the through-beam sensor <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. As a result, the through-beam sensor <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> associated with each pin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> transmits a signal to a controller (not shown) to indicate actuation of the respective locator pin/sensor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. When in its actuated position, the paddle <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is entirely within the pin body <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, so that the locator pin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> as a whole conforms to the SEMI standard. Only when the sensor <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> associated with each pin sends a signal to the controller does the controller assume a wafer carrier is properly positioned thereon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Because of the configuration of the pin body <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the paddle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, if a substrate carrier is not properly seated with its slot <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> properly engaging the pin body <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, but rather with the substrate carrier simply resting on top of the pin body <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, then the paddle <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> will not be actuated, since the paddle <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> does not extend above the uppermost point <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of the pin body <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Consequently, locator pins/sensors <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> do not emit &ldquo;false positive&rdquo; signals, but only are actuated by properly positioned substrate carriers. As a result, only the three sensors, integrated with, respectively, the three locator pins <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, are required to accurately and reliably indicate that a substrate carrier is properly positioned on the pins <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Moreover, placement of the carrier <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> on the pins <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> without the slots <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the carrier <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> properly seated on the pins <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> will not result in a false indication that the carrier <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has been properly placed on the shelf <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The shelf <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and its locator pins/substrate carrier sensors <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is suitable for use in connection with a distributed substrate carrier storage facility such as that disclosed in a co-pending and commonly-assigned U.S. patent application entitled &ldquo;Apparatus for Storing and Moving a Cassette&rdquo;, Ser. No. 09/201,737, filed Dec. 1, 1998, and incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The foregoing description discloses only a preferred embodiment of the invention; modifications of the above disclosed apparatus which fall within the scope of the invention will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. For instance, it will be apparent that the specific embodiments of the inventive locator pin/substrate carrier sensors described herein are configured for use with the present SEMI standard locator pin and cassette slot, and revision of either of these standards may change the specific configuration of the locator pin/substrate carrier sensor embodiments. Further, it will be understood that the specific configuration of the pin, slot, paddle, plunger and sensor, etc., may vary and still fall within the scope of the invention. The plunger and the paddle may be integral. The plunger and paddle may assume various shapes. The plunger slot need not extend vertically and need not be formed near the top of the pin. Other types of sensors may be employed, and the number of pins may vary. Accordingly, while the present invention has been disclosed in connection with preferred embodiments thereof, it should be understood that other embodiments may fall within the spirit and scope of the invention, as defined by the following claims. </paragraph>
