<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A regular tank or aquarium made out of a transparent material and has a separation panel situated at the center. The separation panels is held in place by eight panel-holders position by pairs at each side of the bottom portion and at each side of the upper portion, and are implanted inside the container. Another part of the tank is a back pouch or a slot opening situated at the back of the container. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> Aquarium or fish tanks are found in virtually every household. Ranking as America&apos;s second largest hobby aquarium fish keeping has outranked such popular pastimes as gardening or, stamps collecting. Many aquarists specialize in breeding colorful and exotic species; still others seem to abhor the problems inherent, and try to maintain a peaceful yet magnificent tank collection. But because of the incompatibility that can be found in some species the inhabitant of said tank might not always live such a peaceful Life. One can even find territoriality and aggressiveness among individuals of the same species, thereby causing major problem for the keeper. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In his book &ldquo;Aquarium decorating and planning&rdquo; Wilfried weigel writes: &ldquo;The serious aquarist is not usually satisfied by a single tank. So why not have two matching tanks&quest; This would allow him to have, say, two species of fish from the same habitat witch could not be kept together in captivity; In such a case the tanks could be decorated so as to suggest that they were actually one&rdquo; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> It is the object of the invention to help bypass most of the problems such as cannibalism, keeping livebearers from eating their young. Provide a proper diet for vegetarian and protein eating fish. Keeping smaller fish from large mouth predators, or any other task that usually requires two or more tanks in other to be carried out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Another method that is currently being used for growing fish is a net cage place inside the tank, but it only pertains to fish, and provides little space, however these tanks could also house other animal species. In that case the present invention need not be confine to one shape, certain part can be omitted to allow simplicity.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> As represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> this invention is a regular tank <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> constructed out of a transparent material and as position at the center a separation panel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> forming a dividing wall thereby converting the container into two separate tanks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Implanted inside the tank <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are a total of eight panel-holders <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. A pair is position at the middle of each side of the bottom, and at each side of the top portion of the container in other to facilitate the removal or to hold the separation panel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in place. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Position at the back of the container <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is a rectangular box <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> with four small corners, able to hold in the background picture of an aquarium. </paragraph>
