<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to printing presses and more specifically to a device for aiding placement of a printing sleeve over a cylinder of a printing press. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,089,265, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, purports to disclose a cylinder end fitting sleeve next to a base tube. A flexographic sleeve may be placed over the end fitting sleeve. Radial bores <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>connect with a pressure reducing manifold to aid in sliding a flexographic sleeve onto the base tube. The end fitting sleeve can be removed once the sleeve is on the base tube. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The end fitting sleeve only contacts the flexographic sleeve at only over a limited axial extent of the flexographic sleeve and the flexographic sleeve must be fit over the end fitting sleeve while the end fitting sleeve is attached to the base tube. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,429,048, incorporated by reference herein, discloses an offset lithographic printing press including a tubular-shaped printing blanket which may be axially-removed from a blanket cylinder. The blanket has a metal inner surface, a compressible material layer and a print layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Such abalone may be expandable, for example using air pressure, to aid in placement and removal of the blanket. The metal inner layer thus may be rather thin to permit this expansion, and the blanket may not be extremely rigid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Such blankets used on such offset lithographic printing presses typically have had a circumference equal to the height of the image to be printed, i.e. a blanket size of one image. When the blanket size increases to more than one image, for example two or three images, the blanket may lack strength and compress or collapse. The roundness of the tube thus may be compromised, making placement of the tube on the blanket cylinder difficult. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,823,693 purports to disclose an auxiliary apparatus used to apply a sleeve on a cylinder. The auxiliary apparatus has a cylindrical support on which the sleeve to be applied to the cylinder is retained. The auxiliary apparatus must be rolled next to the printing press and aligned with the cylinder. The sleeve is then removed from the cylindrical support and slid over the cylinder <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The auxiliary apparatus of the &apos;693 patent is bulky and difficult to maneuver. Different height apparatuses must be supplied if the cylinders of the press with sleeves are at different heights, as the auxiliary apparatus rests on the ground. In addition a significant gap remains between the cylindrical support and the cylinder, and the placement of the large-sized sleeves with little stability on the cylindrical support is as difficult as placing the sleeve on the cylinder. Moreover, the sleeve extends axially far beyond the end of the cylindrical support. It is also difficult for a press operator move the sleeve onto the cylinder, as the operator must stand to the side of the auxiliary device. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Commonly-owned U.S. patent application Nos. 09/425,328 and 09/540,790 disclose blanket tube removal devices, which do not significantly increase the stability of a printing roll during placement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> An object of the present invention is to improve the stability of a printing roll when being placed on a cylindrically-shaped object. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a printing sleeve in combination with a support device comprising: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> a printing sleeve having a first end, a second end and an interior surface; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> a support device for acting on the interior surface, the support device having a first position where the support device acts on the interior surface at both the first end and the second end, the support device aiding placement of the sleeve on a cylinder of a printing press. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The support device thus can provide stability at both ends of the printing sleeve. As the printing sleeve is being slid onto its cylinder over a cylinder end, the support device can continue to provide support directly at the cylinder end. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the support device is attached fixedly to the device at the first end. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The support device preferably is light weight so as to be liftable by a press operator. The combination of the sleeve and the support device preferably is, for example, less than 15 kilograms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The support device preferably includes a support cup for clearing bearings at an end of the cylinder of a press onto which the sleeve is to be placed. Thus the support device can act directly on the second end, and a space between the cylinder and the support device can be avoided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the support device includes an inflation device to contact the inner surface when inflated. The inflation device is easily placed inside the sleeve, even if the sleeve is unstable or flimsy. The inflation device may then be inflated to provide the desired stability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The present invention thus also provides a printing sleeve in combination with a support device comprising: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> a printing sleeve having a first end, a second end and an interior surface; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> an inflation device for acting on the interior surface of the printing sleeve when the printing sleeve is removed from a printing press. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the inflation device includes a bellows-type support tube, and the bellows can collapse as the sleeve is pushed over its respective cylinder. The bellows may be supported by a spring support. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The inflation device may include an end part fastenable to the sleeve, and an air valve, so that as the bellows collapses, air is released and the end part remains fastened. The end part may be for example a disk made of plastic or metal. An air pressure gauge also may be provided to measure the pressure in the inflation device. An air hose can supply air through the air valve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The end part may be fastened to the sleeve using an end ring. Opposite the end part may be the support cup for fitting over the cylinder end bearings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The printing sleeve preferably is an offset lithographic blanket sleeve, but may be any type of printing sleeve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides a method for placing a printing sleeve on a printing press comprising the steps of: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> placing an inflation device inside a printing sleeve when the sleeve is removed from a printing press cylinder, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> placing the printing sleeve over the cylinder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the inflation device deflates during the placing step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The present invention further provides a method for placing a printing sleeve on a printing press comprising the steps of: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> placing a support device inside a printing sleeve so that the support device contacts both a first end and an opposing second end of the printing sleeve when the sleeve is removed from a printing press cylinder, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> placing the printing sleeve over the cylinder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the placing step includes a press operator holding both the printing sleeve and the support device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides a printing sleeve in combination with a support device comprising: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> a printing sleeve having a first end, a second end and an interior surface; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> a support device for acting on the interior surface, the support device and the printing sleeve being portable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Portable as defined herein means that a press operator can lift the combination from the ground and place the combination on a cylinder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The sleeve preferably is a printing blanket with two sets of images around the circumference.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a support device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for acting on an interior surface <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of a printing sleeve <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, for example an offset lithographic printing blanket, having a first end <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and a second end <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Sleeve <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> fits over a printing cylinder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of a printing press. Cylinder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is held in a cantilevered-fashion on one side, so that an end <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> shown can remain free when a door in the press frame is opened. At end <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are bearings <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for interacting with the door when closed. Air holes <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of cylinder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be used to provide pressure against the interior surface <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the sleeve when being fit over cylinder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The support device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> includes a support cup <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, which is generally circular in shape and has a diameter less than or equal to the diameter of interior surface <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the diameter of cup <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is less than the diameter of interior surface <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The cup <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> has a central cup-shaped section <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, which can fit over bearings <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Attached to the cup <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> at its outer edges is a bellows-type inflatable rubber tube <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, shown here solely for clarity in an not-fully inflated position. In the fully-inflated position the entire tube <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> would press against inner surface <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. At the end <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the tube <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is connected in a sealed manner to an end disc <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, for example made of plastic or metal. An O-ring grip and O-ring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> can be used for this seal, and also to firmly attach the end disc <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to sleeve <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> at end <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The O-ring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> may be made for example of rubber or metal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The cup <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, inflatable tube <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and end disc <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> thus define an inflation device which can inflate so that tube <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> presses against the entire interior surface <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of sleeve <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Inside the tube may be located a spring <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, for example a coil made of metal, pushing the disc <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and cup <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> away from each other and providing some support to the tube <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Alternately, the spring <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> may only cover a limited axial extend of the tube. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> At the disc <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is placed an air valve <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The air valve <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> permits air to enter tube <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and may release air once a certain pressure is reached inside the inflation device. A pressure gauge <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> may measure the air pressure of the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Fully-inflated tube <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can act to supply pressure to the entirety of interior surface <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, thus making the sleeve <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> rigid and simplifying handling of the sleeve <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Placement of the sleeve end <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, which has cup <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, onto the cylinder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is possible. Moreover, the sleeve <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and inflation device combination is portable, which is defined herein to mean that an operator may lift the combination and place the combination on the cylinder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Portability is highly advantageous, as no external devices with wheels such as dollies are required. The cylinder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may support both the sleeve <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the inflation device when the sleeve <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is being slid onto the sleeve <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, so that the operator may push the sleeve axially without needing to support the weight of the sleeve or inflation device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows more details of the inflation device as the sleeve <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is being slid onto the cylinder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and includes additional optional features with an intake air valve <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and a pressure release valve <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Cup-shaped section <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of cup <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> fits over the bearings <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> on end <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, so that a contact surface <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of cup <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> contacts cylinder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. As the sleeve <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is pushed onto cylinder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the operator may release valve <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, so that tube <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> deflates. As the sleeve <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is further placed on the cylinder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, tube <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can fold in a bellows-type manner as shown, and air can escape out valve <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Once sleeve <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is almost fully on the cylinder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the end disk <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> can be removed by pulling O-ring grip <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> of the disk <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> over O-ring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, which is connected to the outer surface of sleeve <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The inflation device with cup <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is then released from the sleeve <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and may be removed. The sleeve <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> then can be fully placed over cylinder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the door closed over bearings <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the press operated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> If desired, the inflation device may be placed on again as the sleeve is removed, with an air supply <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of compressed air supplied buy an operator causing tube <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to expand. This also can aid in removal of the sleeve <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, as contact surface <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> then presses against cylinder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and forces end <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> away from cylinder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through the O-ring grip <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Alternately or in addition, air from holes <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> could be used to inflate the tube <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, for example through an air by-pass channel <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. The air then passes through a pressure valve <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> into tube <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. A pressure release valve <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> can be set so that the air in the tube <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> causes the tube to expand slowly. Valves <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. A pressure disk <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> sits on a spring <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, the spring strength for each valve being selected to permit the air from holes <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to inflate the tube <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> gently. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The inflation device may also remain on the sleeve during operation in an extension area of the sleeve. </paragraph>
