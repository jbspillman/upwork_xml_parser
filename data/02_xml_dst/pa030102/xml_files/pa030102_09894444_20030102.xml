<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to fasteners for joining wood pieces, and more particularly to an improved fastener that securely locks into place within a pair of joined wood pieces to substantially prevent undesired shifting or separation of the joined wood pieces, such as, for example, in securing components of a wooden picture frame. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Conventional fasteners for joining a number of wood pieces are typically made from metal and may contain a substantially planar section having portions that enter each of the number of wood pieces to prevent the wood pieces from separating from one another. The ends of the wood pieces may be positioned relative to one another to form various types of joints (miter joints, for example). Some existing metal fasteners, such as V-nails, are folded at portions along their planar section to improve their strength and stability during driving. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> To further improve the strength and stability of a joint, prior art metal fasteners may include one or more corrugations. These corrugations may be angled with respect to ends of the metal fastener to draw the wood pieces together as they are joined, reducing separation of the wood pieces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,514,126 to Knowles discloses a corrugated staple having first and second pairs of angled corrugations extending the full height of the staple, from a trailing edge to a leading edge. A third pair of corrugations runs parallel to the trailing edge and leading edge. Notches on the sides of the staple facilitate handling and shipment of the staple. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 2,156,682 to Dimoush discloses a metal fastener having a sheet-like metal body formed of flat or curvilinear, transverse corrugations extending from an upper driving edge to a lower sharpened, serrated entering edge. Grooves within the corrugations contain lateral projections to help secure the joint formed by the wood pieces and the metal fastener. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 2,377,169 to Mohr discloses a corrugated metal fastener having a number of vertically spaced barbs projecting outwardly from each end and from an apex of the corrugations. The triangle-shaped barbs project upwardly (towards the driving edge) and outwardly for biting into wood pieces after the corrugated metal fastener has been driven. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> While these and other prior art metal fasteners help increase maintenance of a joint, they do not sufficiently address the problem of inadvertent shifting of the metal fastener within the wood pieces to be joined, particularly when the ends of the pieces are joined at an angle to one another (such as with a miter joint). If the wood pieces are shifted (during transport, for example), or if the wood flexes (due to shrinking, expanding, warping, for example) the metal fastener has a tendency to loosen from within the wood. This in turn loosens the joint, causing additional shifting of the wood pieces, which adds to the problem. Also, the prior art fasteners may damage the wood fibers to a greater extent than the present invention as they are driven into the wood pieces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, one object of the present invention is to provide an improved fastener that is less likely to undesirably shift from within a joint than prior art fasteners. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A further object of the present invention is to provide an improved fastener that is easy to manufacture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A still further object of the present invention is to provide an improved fastener that enables tighter locking than previous fasteners, yet is not substantially more difficult to drive and minimizes damage to wood fibers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an improved fastener that is dimensioned substantially similarly to typical fasteners, to allow a wide variety of applications. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> These and other objects are met or exceeded by providing an improved fastener for joining at least two wood pieces, the fastener having a plate-like member defined between a leading edge and a trailing edge. The leading edge is configured to enter the wood pieces before the trailing edge. In one principal type of embodiment, the fastener also includes at least two corrugations formed on the plate-like member, extending in a generally longitudinal direction, and a locking portion disposed on the plate-like member near the trailing edge for locking the fastener within the wood pieces. A longitudinal direction is defined as the direction extending from the leading edge toward the trailing edge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> By providing this locking portion near the trailing edge, or drive end, of the plate-like member, the fastener can be driven substantially as easily as with prior art devices. However, after the corrugations have drawn the wood pieces together, and as the trailing edge is driven into the wood pieces to be joined, the locking portion is compressed by the wood pieces. This locks the wood pieces while they are tightly drawn together, thus locking the fastener within the joint, and more securely holding the wood pieces together, even during shifting or flexing of the wood pieces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The locking portion preferably includes one or more rows of projections such as, but not limited to, barbs and dimpled projections. If more than one row of projections is utilized, the projections may be staggered among the rows. The corrugations may be straight or angled with respect to sides of the plate-like member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> An alternate locking portion includes a non-corrugated section near the trailing edge, defined by trailing outer ends of corrugations that extend from the leading edge towards the trailing edge, but terminate longitudinally short of the trailing edge so that an area is created for the non-corrugated section longitudinally between the trailing outer ends of the corrugations and the trailing edge. This enables the wood pieces to compress around the non-corrugated section and the trailing outer ends of the corrugations, to further secure the fastener. The non-corrugated section may contain barbs and/or dimpled projections, and these may be arranged in rows and/or staggered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Instead of a plate-like member typical with a corrugated nail, the present invention also contemplates a fastener such as an improved V-nail having a folded rectangular section and a locking portion. In addition, the V-nail may include one or more corrugations similar to that of a corrugated fastener, and the corrugations may extend longitudinally to the trailing edge or terminate short of the trailing edge to create a non-corrugated portion.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> A first principal type of embodiment of the present invention is shown by example in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The present fastener is especially suited for joining two adjacent pieces of wood, such as members of a picture frame. Naturally, other such joining applications are contemplated as is known in the art. Also, the present fastener is especially suited for use in automatic picture frame assembly machines or other fastener driving machines, or for being driven by hand. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> As shown in the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> first fastener <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a preferably metal and generally rectangular plate-like member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with first <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and second <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> lateral edges. The plate-like member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has a leading edge <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, or entry end, extending laterally across the plate-like member for entry into portions of a pair of wood pieces (not shown) to be joined. Preferably, the leading edge <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is beveled or sharpened to facilitate entry of the first fastener <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> into the wood pieces. A trailing edge <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, or drive end, extends laterally across an opposite edge of the plate-like member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> from the leading edge <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. In a preferred embodiment, two or more corrugations <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> extend in a substantially longitudinal direction from the leading edge <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to the trailing edge <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The corrugations <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be straight or curvilinear, and may be angled with respect to the lateral edges <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> so that an area <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> between the corrugations is tapered as it approaches the trailing edge <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Near the trailing edge <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the first fastener <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is configured to include a locking portion, generally designated <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, for securing the first fastener into the wood pieces after being driven. The term &ldquo;locking portion&rdquo; is intended to include a section of the fastener <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> modified to help lock the fastener within the wood pieces being joined together. Methods of locking may include, but are not limited to, compression of the wood pieces around the locking portion, expansion of the wood pieces into the locking portion, adhesion between the locking portion and the wood pieces, or the like. As used herein, the phrase &ldquo;near the trailing edge&rdquo; refers to the intention that the locking portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> be longitudinally closer to the trailing edge <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> than to the leading edge <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. More particularly, it is preferred that the locking portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> be longitudinally disposed in a lower third of the fastener <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> towards the trailing edge <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and most preferably in a lower eighth of the fastener. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The locking portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the first fastener <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a series of projections, such as barbs <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, disposed laterally across the first fastener to form a row <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of barbs. Preferably formed by partially cutting and punching out sections of the metal plate-like member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the barbs <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are formed in the plate-like member at a base <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and preferably extend outwardly and downwardly toward the trailing edge <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> while narrowing to a point <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, so that the barbs form a V-shape (when oriented as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). Alternatively, the barbs <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may be oriented in various other directions. The barbs <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> allow the wood pieces to smoothly pass over the fastener <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as the fastener is driven into the wood pieces, minimizing damage to the wood, but restrict movement of the fastener in the opposite direction as the wood pieces compress around the barbs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> While a locking portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> having a single row <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of barbs <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, other embodiments are contemplated. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a second fastener <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> having the row <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of barbs <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, plus a second row <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of barbs, arranged in a staggered formation relative to one another. The barbs <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may, but need not, alternate between the row <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of barbs and the second row <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of barbs across the locking portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. In addition to the rows <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of barbs <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> on the locking portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, it is contemplated that other barbs or projections may be arranged on the remainder of the surface of the fastener <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The locking portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may also be formed on alternate types of fasteners. For example, a third fastener <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and a fourth fastener <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, both V-nails, are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, respectively, each containing folded rectangular members <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> preferably having a generally W-shaped profile. The folded rectangular members <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> include locking portions <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> containing the row <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of barbs <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> (seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>), or both the row of barbs and the second row <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of barbs, staggered relative to one another (seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Additional or alternative types or configurations of projections for the locking portions <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are contemplated as well. The term &ldquo;projections&rdquo; is intended to generally encompass any structure projecting from the fastener <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which creates additional pressure and/or friction with the surrounding wood pieces to help prevent shifting of the fastener <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a fifth fastener <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> with a locking portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> having a single row <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of dimpled projections <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The dimpled projections <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are preferably rounded, and are preferably formed by indenting sections of the plate-like member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, without punching completely through the surface of the sections, as seen in the dimpled projection of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows a sixth fastener <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> which is a V-nail having a row <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of dimpled projections <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Many other variations, configurations, and arrangements of projections are contemplated by the present invention. Instead of, or in addition to, the projections, adhesives (glue, e.g.) applied to the locking portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may be used to secure a connection with the wood pieces. In this alternative embodiment, the frictional force of the fastener <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> while being driven may at least partially melt the adhesive, which then solidifies after the fastener is inserted, adhering to portions of the wood pieces as well to secure a connection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In operation, by disposing the locking portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> containing the dimpled projections <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> or the barbs <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> near the trailing edge <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the fastener <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> (collectively referred to as &ldquo;the fastener <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&rdquo;) the fastener is driven into the wood pieces (in a miter joint, for example) from the leading edge <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> with typical resistance, and with minimal damage to the wood fibers. The corrugations <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (if a corrugated fastener) or folded rectangular members <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> (if a V-nail) draw the wood pieces together. At or near a maximum point of tightness of the joint, near the end of the driving process, the barbs <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and/or the dimpled projections <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of the locking portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> enter the wood pieces. The wood pieces contact the dimpled projections <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> or barbs <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the locking portion, and at least partially compress around them. The fastener <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is thus locked as it is driven into the wood pieces. Even if the wood pieces forming the joint later shift with time, the fastener <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> remains locked into the wood pieces because the wood pieces are locked at a point where they are tightly drawn together. If the wood pieces later expand or flex, the wood should continue to compress at least a portion of the locking section <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, further hindering shifting of the fastener <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. This helps secure the connection of the wood pieces to be joined, and helps prevent undesired loosening of the joint. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, showing an example of a second principal type of embodiment of the present invention, the locking portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> includes a non-corrugated section <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> at or near the trailing edge <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. As shown by example in the seventh fastener <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the corrugations <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> extend from the leading edge <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> down toward the trailing edge <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, but terminate short of the trailing edge at a pair of trailing outer ends <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, thus defining the non-corrugated section <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> between the pair of trailing outer ends of the corrugations and the trailing edge. The term &ldquo;trailing outer ends&rdquo; is intended to indicate the outer ends of the corrugations <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> that are closer to the trailing edge <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (the lower ends, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>). This non-corrugated section <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> may be a flat portion extending across the plate-like member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, between the first and second lateral edges <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, as shown in the seventh fastener <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. Alternatively, the non-corrugated section <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> may include one or more rows of projections, such as the row <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of barbs <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> shown in the eighth fastener <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, or the row of barbs and the row <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of dimpled projections <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> shown staggered from one another in the ninth fastener <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> By placing the non-corrugated section <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> at or near the trailing edge <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the plate-like member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the preferably angled corrugations <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> draw the wood pieces together. The trailing edge <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is driven into the joint, and the wood pieces, while being tightly drawn together, compress both the trailing outer ends <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the corrugations <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the portion of the plate-like member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> forming the non-corrugated section <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, to more securely lock the fastener <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> in place. Preferably, while being joined, the wood pieces are deformed substantially only by the corrugations <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the sharp leading edge <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the plate-like member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, before compressing the locking portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. When the non-corrugated section <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is combined with the barbs <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and/or the dimpled projections <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> to form the locking section <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, additional locking benefits are realized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In a third principal type of embodiment, shown by example in FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a tenth fastener <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, such as a V-nail, is provided with corrugations <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The corrugations <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> may extend longitudinally within the folded rectangular member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> from the leading edge <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to the trailing edge <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, as shown in the tenth fastener <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, or terminate short of the trailing edge at a pair of trailing outer ends <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, as shown in the eleventh fastener <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, to create a locking portion with a second non-corrugated section <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> between the trailing outer ends of the corrugations and the trailing edge of the eleventh fastener. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The non-corrugated section <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> may also contain one or more rows of projections, such as the row <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of dimpled projections <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> shown in the twelfth fastener of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, or the row of dimpled projections and the row <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of barbs <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> staggered from one another, as shown in the thirteenth fastener <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> It will be obvious to one skilled in the art that various alterations and combinations of the types of embodiments described above are possible, and all of these are contemplated by the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> While various embodiments of the present improved fastener have been shown and described, it should be understood that other modifications, substitutions and alternatives may be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art.
