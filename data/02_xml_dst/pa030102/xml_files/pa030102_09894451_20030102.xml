<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a hand-held device for exposing buried objects such as gas lines, sewer lines, telephone lines, and television cables. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> With the present-day increase in the use of fiber optic cables, there has been a proliferation of horizontal boring machines which are utilized to lay the cables. The horizontal boring machines enable contractors to lay cables under parking lots, highways, and other utilities without disturbing them. While horizontal boring machines are extremely accurate, their biggest advantage is that of estimating the depth of the boring equipment. While all intersecting utility lines are generally marked with paint on the surface, there are usually inaccuracies in the depth given by the utility company. The inaccuracies described above may result in the intersecting utility being &ldquo;in harm&apos;s way.&rdquo; This has resulted in the interruption of many utility services wherein gas lines were drilled, sewer lines were drilled, as well as telephone lines and television cables. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Accidents have become so frequent that it has become necessary to expose the utility lines prior to making the horizontal bore. The utility lines have been exposed by digging a hole in the ground. At first these holes were hand-dug, which is time-consuming and not without accidents. Such accidents caused the horizontal boring industry to solicit help from the sewer cleaning industry. Hydro-jetting trucks were used to loosen the soil in the hole and vacuum trucks were used to suction up the mud thus produced. While this does a good job, it requires two very expensive pieces of equipment as well as two operators to operate the same. The next generation of pot-holers or day-lighters, was a jet/vac trailer. The jet/vac trailer has a small hydro-jetting machine on the front of the trailer and a small vacuum or suction tank on the rear of the trailer. While this is less expensive, it still requires two operators. The mud thus produced and collected is usually disposed of at the sewer waste treatment plant which normally charges for the disposal. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A hand-held device is disclosed for exposing buried objects such as utility lines or cables. The device is comprised of an elongated, hollow tube having upper and lower ends with first and second water supply conduits positioned adjacent the tube. Each of the water supply conduits has an intake end and a discharge end. The discharge end of the first water supply conduit is positioned adjacent the lower end of the tube and has a digging nozzle mounted thereon. The discharge end of the second water supply line is directed upwardly into the tube adjacent the lower end thereof. A mud take-off conduit is in fluid communication with the upper end of the tube. A two-way valve is positioned adjacent the upper end of the tube and has intake and discharge sides. The discharge side of the valve is in fluid communication with the intake ends of the first and second water supply conduits. The intake side of the valve is in fluid communication with a high pressure water pump. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In use, water is directed downwardly through the first fluid conduit and is discharged from the cutting nozzle to loosen dirt in the hole being dug above the utility line or cable. When the hole becomes full of mud, the two-way valve is switched so that water is directed downwardly through the second water conduit and thence upwardly into the lower end of the tube to create a suction therein so that the mud in the hole is vacuumed or sucked upwardly therethrough into the mud take-off conduit which may be in fluid communication with a mud collection container or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is therefore a principal object of the invention to provide a hand-held device for exposing buried objects such as utility lines or cables. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Still another object of the invention is to provide a hand-held device for exposing buried objects which may be operated by one person. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Still another object of the invention is to provide a hand-held device for exposing buried objects wherein water is used to dig a hole in the ground above the object being exposed with the mud created by the drilling operation being vacuumed out of the hole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A further object of the invention is to provide a hand-held device for exposing buried objects which is economical of manufacture, refined in appearance, and durable in use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> These and other objects will be apparent to those skilled in the art.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In the drawings, the numeral <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> refers to the hand-held device of this invention. Device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes an elongated hollow plastic tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having an upper end <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and a lower end <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is comprised of a rigid plastic material. A mud take-off hose <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is operatively connected to the upper end <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and is in communication with a mud collection container <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The container <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is optional since the hose <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> could be used to simply spray the mud onto the ground surface rather than collecting the same. The tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is provided with an offset portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, as seen in the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> A first water conduit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is positioned adjacent the exterior surface of tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and has an upper end <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and a lower end <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. A conventional, spinning discharge or cutting nozzle <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is mounted on the lower end of the conduit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> so as to be positioned laterally of the lower end <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A second water supply line <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is positioned adjacent the exterior surface of the tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and has an upper end <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The lower end of conduit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is directed upwardly into the lower end portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and has a nozzle <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> positioned thereon which is centrally located with respect to the center axis of the tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> A two-way valve <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> has its discharge sides in fluid communication with the upper ends of the water conduits <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. A water supply hose <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> extends from the intake side of the two-way valve <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to a source of water under high pressure such as a jetter pump <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> When it is desired to expose a buried object such as a utility line or cable <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, a pot-hole or daylight hole is initially dug into the ground with a shovel or the like. The purpose of starting the hole with a shovel is to contain the discharging water within the hole and to avoid splashing mud onto the operator of the device. The operator then activates two-way valve <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> so that water under high pressure is discharged from the nozzle <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to loosen soil within the hole, as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. When the hole is partially or substantially filled with mud, the two-way valve <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is operated to close line <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and to open line <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). The water passing downwardly through water supply line <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and upwardly into the tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> causes a suction or vacuum at the lower end of the tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to suck or vacuum the muddy water from the hole upwardly through the tube <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, hose <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and into the container <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The digging (loosening) and vacuuming operation is repeated until the hole has been sufficiently dug downwardly to expose the utility line <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. It can therefore be seen that a novel hand-held device has been disclosed for exposing buried objects such as utility lines or the like which may be operated by a single person and which will not damage the utility line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Thus it can be seen that the invention accomplishes at least all of its stated objectives. </paragraph>
