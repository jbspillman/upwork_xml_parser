<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The support member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> proximate the rear housing member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is formed with a downwardly depending inclined portion <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and an upwardly extending portion <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. The downwardly depending inclined portion <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> has a surface <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and includes an orifice <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> to support a leading upwardly depending inclined portion <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> having a surface <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> including orifice <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> of the rear housing member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. A bearing member <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> is positioned between the surfaces <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> of the support member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and rear housing member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, respectively. A threaded lug <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and nut <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> cooperate to rotatably support the inclined portion <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> of the support member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to the leading inclined portion <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> of the rear housing member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Thus, the rear housing member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is articulately mounted to the elongated support member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, as described in the aforementioned copending application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The rear housing member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is quadra-cylindrically-shaped and includes orifices <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> formed in right and left shoulder portions <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, thereof. A generally cylindrically-shaped roller member, generally indicated as <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, including roller bearing member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is positioned on a shaft <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> including cylindrically-shaped spacer sleeve member <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> mounted within the orifices <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, such as by bolt <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. The generally cylindrically-shaped roller member <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is similarly formed of a flexible resilient material, as is the front spherically-shaped tire or roller member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and is preferably honeycombed for weight considerations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the generally cylindrically-shaped rear tire or roller member <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be formed of members to be inflatable to any desired pressure as a function of the intended use and concomitant terrain conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The roller member <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, referring particularly to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, is comprised of hemispherically-shaped outer members <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> mounted to hemispherically-shaped inner members <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and a cylindrically-shaped intermediate member <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> having a bearing surface <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, as more fully hereinafter described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The elongate support member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> having a supporting surface <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is provided with a rearwardly disposed fixed foot support <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> including strap member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and a forwardly disposed foot support <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> including strap member <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> positioned for rotation in a throughbore <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> formed in the elongated support member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and secured therein by a threaded nut. The foot support members <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> assists the user in operation of the all-terrain riding assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As hereinafter discussed, the main body member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is rotatably disposed with respect to the rear housing member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> thereby providing an articulating relationship therebetween to facilitate the user&apos;s ability to guide or steer the all-terrain assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention during operation. The surface portions <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the main body <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and rear housing member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are formed at an angle of about 30 degrees to the horizontal axis of the support surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the main body member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to provide free rotational relationships therebetween. It will be understood by one skilled in the art that the articulating angle may be varied, it is chosen to provide facile cooperation between the articulating elements to provide required cooperation during use. By adjusting tension of the spring member <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, the relative force between the rear housing member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to the main body member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be altered differing tension connections to facilitate safe and enjoyable use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The velocity control assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 6</cross-reference> is comprised of the hollow bulb member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> connected via a tube <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> to an air piston member, generally indicated as <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> mounted within the rear housing member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, such as by a bolt <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. The piston member <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> is disposed in paralleled relationship to the cylindrically-shaped intermediate portion <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> of the rear roller member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The air piston member <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> includes a chamber <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> in which is disposed a spring loaded piston member <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> including an arm member <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> connected to a lever member <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The lever member <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> is formed with a strap holding slot <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> for engaging one end of a strap member <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>, such as by screw members <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> (one shown). The strap member <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> is coursed about a roller assembly <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> mounted within the rear housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, about the cylindrically-shaped intermediate portion <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> of the rear roller member <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> with a forward end <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> thereof affixed to a strap retaining member <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> mounted within the rear housing member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In operation, referring particularly to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 7</cross-reference>, during use of the riding assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the rear roller member <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is caused to rotate in the direction of the arrows &ldquo;A&rdquo;. The user, upon squeezing of the bulb member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, causes the piston member <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> within the air chamber <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> to be downwardly disposed and thus effect downward rotation of the lever member <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> about a pivot thereby causing the strap <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> to frictionally engage the surface <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> of the cylindrically-shaped intermediate member <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> of the rear roller member <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and effect a reduction in the rotational velocity of the rear roller member <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and thus reduced the linear velocity of the all terrain rising assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be formed of any suitable material, e.g. metal, such as aluminum or steel, or a plastic material such as ABS, capable of supporting the weight of a user over both smooth terrain and irregular terrain without breakage after normal use. Thus, the materials and structural configuration are selected to provide design criteria for repetitive use of the assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The quadra-spherically-shaped front member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is configured to provide close fitting, but non-interfering relationship to the tire or roller member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and is dimensioned to deflect and to prevent small impediments from lodging therebetween to interrupt rotation of the rotating member as well as to prevent inadvertent contact by the user to the rolling surfaces of tire or rolling members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The tire or roller member are generally of like diameter and of from 6 to 12 inches, preferably about 8 to 10 inches, but may be as large as 16 to 20 inches. The width of the cylindrically-shaped member is preferably equal to the diameter thereof and may extend to a width of twice the diameter thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the preferred embodiment of the present invention includes a spherically-shaped front roller member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to provide more effective directional control whereby directional alteration of the front tire or wheel member cause the rolling axis thereof to more readily assume a great circle contacting relationship to the terrain. It will be understood by one skilled in the art that the front wheel or tire member may take other rotating shapes, e.g. oblately-shaped, however, a spherically-shaped front tire or wheel member provides greater stability and steering capabilities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> While the present invention has been described with respect to the exemplar embodiments thereof, it will be recognized by one of ordinary skill in the art that many modifications and changes can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Therefore it is manifestly intended that the scope of the invention be limited only by the claims and the equivalents thereof. </paragraph>
