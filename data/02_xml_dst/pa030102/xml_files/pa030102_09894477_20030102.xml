<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to polishing systems for polishing a surface of a substrate to a desired surface profile or finish and, more particularly, to an automated polishing system and method of polishing a surface of a substrate during a polishing cycle using computer control. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Automated polishing systems have been developed to polish surfaces of optical and non-optical components to precise surface finishes and surface profiles through an abrasion process using a polishing tool and a polishing slurry. For example, automated polishing systems have been used to obtain precise surface finishes and profiles on spherical and aspherical optical lenses using a computer-controlled polishing spindle that moves a rotating polishing tool across the surface of a rotating lens according to a pre-programmed tool path. The tool path may be defined by coordinates along three orthogonal axes so that the polishing tool follows the general profile of the lens during a polishing cycle to obtain the desired surface finish and profile on the lens. The velocity of the polishing tool is varied as it traverses the lens so that more lens material is removed in areas of relatively slow traverse. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Prior to the polishing cycle, the profile of the lens to be polished is measured and compared with a reference lens profile stored in a computer. The computer determines whether the actual surface profile of the lens differs from the reference lens profile by a predetermined error amount. If so, the computer executes a material removal algorithm that determines a predetermined tool path for the polishing tool to follow across the surface of the lens and the required velocity profile of the polishing tool so that the desired surface finish and profile will be obtained during the polishing cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The amount of material removed from the surface of the lens is determined by the polishing pressure applied by the polishing tool to the surface of the lens and also by the velocity profile of the polishing tool as it traverses the lens during a polishing cycle. The amount of material removed from the surface of the lens is increased with either an increase in the pressure applied by the polishing tool to the surface of the lens or an increase in the dwell time of the polishing head in a particular annular region of the lens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, in the event fluctuations occur in the pressure applied by the polishing tool to the surface of the lens as it traverses the lens, without a change in the velocity profile of the polishing tool to compensate for the fluctuation in polishing pressure, the lens will not obtain the desired surface finish and profile during the polishing cycle. In those areas of increased polishing pressure, more lens material will be removed than desired, while other areas receiving a lighter polishing pressure will not have enough material removed to obtain the desired surface finish and profile. These pressure fluctuations may occur due to positioning inaccuracies in the polishing system mechanics responsible for moving the polishing spindle during the polishing cycle, and also to the surface profile geometry encountered by the polishing tool during the polishing cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Thus, there is a need for an automated polishing system for optical and non-optical components that is not susceptible to polishing pressure fluctuations during a polishing cycle so as to provide uniform surface finishes and accurate curve profiles on the polished component. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The present invention overcomes the foregoing and other shortcomings and drawbacks of automated polishing systems and polishing methods heretofore known. While the invention will be described in connection with certain embodiments, it will be understood that the invention is not limited to these embodiments. On the contrary, the invention includes all alternatives, modifications and equivalents as may be included within the spirit and scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The polishing system of the present invention is particularly adapted to polish a surface of a substrate, such as a surface of an optical mold pin, to a desired surface profile and finish under the automated control of a computer during a polishing cycle. The polishing system includes a polishing spindle assembly that is adapted to support the rotating polishing tool and is operable to move in at least one of a direction toward and away from the rotating mold pin to contact the polishing tool on the surface of the mold pin with a predetermined torque on the polishing tool during the polishing cycle. The polishing tool is contacted under pressure with the surface of the mold pin during a polishing cycle to obtain the desired surface profile and finish on the mold pin. The polishing tool includes a polishing head that is covered with an abrasive polishing paste and placed into contact with the mold pin during the polishing cycle to remove material from the surface of the mold pin through abrasion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A positioning mechanism is operatively connected to the polishing spindle assembly and is operable to move the polishing spindle assembly in at least one of a direction toward and away from the mold pin. In one embodiment, the positioning mechanism has three (3) orthogonal axes of translation to guide movement and control positioning of the polishing spindle assembly and the polishing tool relative to the mold pin during a polishing cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A control is operatively coupled to the positioning mechanism and the polishing spindle assembly. The control is operable to adjust positioning of the polishing spindle assembly in at least one of a direction toward and away from the substrate to maintain the torque on the polishing tool substantially constant, and therefore the contact pressure applied by the polishing tool to the surface of the mold pin substantially constant, during the polishing cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, a torque sensor is associated with the polishing spindle assembly and is operatively coupled to the control. The torque sensor is operable to sense a torque on the polishing tool during the polishing cycle. The control is responsive to the torque sensed by the torque sensor to adjust positioning of the polishing spindle assembly in at least one of a direction toward and away from the mold pin to maintain the torque on the polishing tool substantially constant during the polishing cycle. The torque sensor may be mounted to remain substantially stationary during the polishing cycle or, alternatively, the torque sensor may be mounted to rotate during the polishing cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> By maintaining the torque substantially constant on the polishing tool during the polishing cycle, the polishing system of the present invention is able to provide uniform surface finishes and accurate curve profile on the surface of the mold pin. The polishing system maintains a constant polishing pressure on the polishing tool during the polishing cycle to accurately and reliably remove material from the surface of the mold pin so that the desired surface finish and curve profile is obtained. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> With reference to the Figures, and to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in particular, an automated polishing system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is shown in accordance with the principles of the present invention. As will be described in more detail below, polishing system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is particularly adapted to polish a surface of a substrate, such as the surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>) of an optical mold pin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>), to a desired surface profile and finish under the automated control of a controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) during a polishing cycle. It will be understood that controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may comprise a desktop or PC-based computer or, alternatively, a combination of a PC-based computer and an industrial controller known to those skilled in the art. While the present invention will be described in detail herein in an exemplary environment for polishing the surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of optical mold pin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the polishing system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention is readily adapted to polish a variety of substrate surfaces, including metal, plastic and other material surfaces, and to polish a variety of parts, including both optical and non-optical parts, without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> As those skilled in the art will appreciate, mold pin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is used in the manufacture of plastic optical lenses (not shown) for projection television sets and various other types of optical systems. During the optical lens manufacturing process, a pair of mold pins <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, typically manufactured from steel, are inserted into opposite ends of a mold cavity (not shown) with the profiled surfaces <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the mold pins <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> positioned in spaced and confronting relationship within the mold cavity (not shown). The mold cavity (not shown) is then injected with molten plastic lens material so that the confronting profiled surfaces <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the mold pins <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> generally define the optical surface profiles of the optical lens (not shown). For this reason, the surfaces <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the mold pins <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> must be polished to very precise surface finishes and profiles so that the desired optical surface profiles are obtained on the optical lens during the lens molding process. The optical lens (not shown) may then be polished through a further polishing process to achieve the desired optical characteristics of the lens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Further referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the polishing system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a support frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, a positioning mechanism <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> supported by the support frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and a polishing spindle assembly <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> mounted to the positioning mechanism <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. As will be described in greater detail below, polishing spindle assembly <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is adapted to hold and rotate a polishing tool <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, known to those skilled in the art, that is contacted under pressure with the surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the mold pin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> during a polishing cycle to obtain the desired surface profile and finish on the mold pin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The polishing tool <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> includes a polishing head <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> that is covered with an abrasive polishing paste and placed into contact with the mold pin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> during the polishing cycle to remove material from the surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the mold pin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> through abrasion as will be described in detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As shown <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the positioning mechanism <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has three (3) orthogonal axes of translation <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, respectively, to guide movement and control positioning of the polishing spindle assembly <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the polishing tool <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> relative to the mold pin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> during a polishing cycle. The translational axis <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, referred to herein as the &ldquo;X&rdquo; axis, is aligned generally parallel with the longitudinal axis (not shown) of the polishing system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> so that movement of the positioning mechanism <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> along the &ldquo;X&rdquo; axis <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, represented by arrow <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, moves the polishing spindle assembly <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in a side-by-side manner along a pre-programmed tool path and with a pre-programmed velocity relative to the mold pin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The translational axis <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, referred to herein as the &ldquo;Y&rdquo; axis, is aligned generally perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the polishing system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> so that movement of the positioning mechanism <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> along the &ldquo;Y&rdquo; axis <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, represented by arrow <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, moves the polishing spindle assembly <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and polishing tool <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> fore and aft along a pre-programmed tool path and with a pre-programmed velocity relative to the mold pin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Lastly, the translational axis <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, referred to herein as the &ldquo;Z&rdquo; axis, is aligned generally perpendicular to the &ldquo;X&rdquo; and &ldquo;Y&rdquo; axes <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, respectively, so that movement of the positioning mechanism <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> along the &ldquo;Z&rdquo; axis <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, represented by arrow <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, raises and lowers the polishing spindle assembly <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and polishing tool <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to a pre-programmed position relative to the mold pin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Further referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the positioning mechanism <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes a gantry <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> that is slidably mounted to the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> through attached bearing blocks <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> that are adapted to slide on a pair of linear rails <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> aligned generally along the &ldquo;Y&rdquo; axis <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> on opposite sides of the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Movement of the gantry <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> along the rails <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is controlled by a screw assembly <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> that operates under the control of a driver or servomotor <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The servomotor <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> receives &ldquo;Y&rdquo; axis control signals from the controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and, in response to the control signals, is operable to move the gantry <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and the associated polishing spindle assembly <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> mounted thereto, along the &ldquo;Y&rdquo; axis in a pre-programmed direction and along a pre-programmed tool path during a polishing cycle. One or more position encoders (not shown) are provided to apply position status information to the controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for monitoring the position of the gantry <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> along the &ldquo;Y&rdquo; axis <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. As will be described in greater detail below, the polishing spindle assembly <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may remain stationary at a pre-programmed position along the &ldquo;Y&rdquo; axis during a polishing cycle, such as along the center of the mold pin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the polishing spindle assembly <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may move along a pre-programmed tool path and with a pre-programmed velocity along the &ldquo;Y&rdquo; axis <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> during a polishing cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The gantry <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> includes a pair of linear slide assemblies <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> that guide movement of the polishing spindle assembly <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> along the &ldquo;X&rdquo; and &ldquo;Z&rdquo; axes <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, respectively. Linear slide assembly <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is mounted to an upstanding wall <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the gantry <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and controls positioning and movement of the polishing spindle assembly <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> along the &ldquo;X&rdquo; axis <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> through a driver or servomotor (not shown). The &ldquo;X&rdquo; axis servomotor (not shown) receives &ldquo;X&rdquo; axis control signals from the controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and, in response to the control signals, is operable to move a slide block <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> supporting the polishing spindle assembly <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in a pre-programmed direction and with a pre-programmed velocity along the &ldquo;X&rdquo; axis <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> during a polishing cycle. One or more position encoders (not shown) are provided to apply position status information to the controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for monitoring the position of the polishing spindle assembly <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> along the &ldquo;X&rdquo; axis <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

Linear slide assembly <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> controls positioning and movement of the polishing spindle assembly <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> along the &ldquo;Z&rdquo; axis <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> through a driver or servomotor <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The servomotor <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> receives &ldquo;Z&rdquo; axis control signals from the controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and, in response to the control signals, is operable to move a slide block <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> supporting the polishing spindle assembly <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in a pre-programmed direction and to a pre-programmed position along the &ldquo;Z&rdquo; axis <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> during a polishing cycle as will be described in greater detail below.

<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows an exemplary polishing process for polishing the mold pin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to a desired surface finish and profile in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Initially, at step <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, the desired design parameters of the mold pin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, i.e., the part profile of a mold pin having the desired surface finish and geometric surface profile, are entered into a database of a computer system (not shown). At step <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, the geometric surface profile of a mold pin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to be polished is measured using a coordinate measuring machine so that the actual surface profile of the mold pin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be compared to the reference mold pin profile stored in a database. The computer system (not shown) determines whether the actual surface profile of mold pin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> differs from the reference mold pin surface profile by a predetermined error amount. If so, the computer system (not shown) executes a material removal algorithm at step <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> that determines a predetermined tool path for the polishing head <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to follow across the surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the mold pin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the required dwell times to achieve the desired surface finish and profile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> For example, the tool path may travel in a direction along the &ldquo;X&rdquo; axis <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> over the center of the mold pin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, beginning at the peripheral edge of the mold pin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and moving radially inwardly to the center of the part so that the desired material removal on the surface of the mold pin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is achieved in a single pass. Alternatively, the tool path may include a return pass of the polishing tool <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in a direction along the &ldquo;X&rdquo; axis <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> from the center of the mold pin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> radially outwardly to the peripheral edge of the part. In another alternative, the tool path may include one or more passes in a direction along the &ldquo;X&rdquo; axis <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> as described in detail above, and one or more transverse passes in a direction along the &ldquo;Y&rdquo; axis <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The material removal algorithm optimizes the tool path to remove the desired amount of material on the surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the mold pin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in an optimized manner. After this optimization process in step <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the material removal algorithm generates computer numerical control code at step <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> that is used by the controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to control movement and positioning of the polishing spindle assembly <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the associated polishing tool <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> during a polishing cycle. At step <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, polishing system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> performs a polishing cycle on the mold pin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> according to the computer numerical control code generated at step <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and executed by the controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. At step <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, a determination is made whether the desired surface profile and finish has been obtained on the mold pin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. If yes, the polishing cycle is complete and the mold pin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is removed from the system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Otherwise, the profile of mold pin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is re-measured at step <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> and another polishing cycle is performed on the mold pin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> It will be understood by those skilled in the art that the amount of material removed from the surface <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of mold pin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is determined by the polishing pressure applied by the polishing head <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to the surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of mold pin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and also by the amount of time the polishing head <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> dwells in a particular annular region of the rotating mold pin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The amount of material removed from the surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the mold pin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is increased with either an increase in the pressure applied by the polishing head <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to the surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the mold pin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> or an increase in the dwell time of the polishing head <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in a particular annular region of the mold pin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

In this way, the amount of material removed from the surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the mold pin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is determined or controlled by controlling the dwell times or velocity profile of the polishing head <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> as it moves along the pre-programmed tool path across the surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the mold pin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
