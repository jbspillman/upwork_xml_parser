<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Prefatory to a discussion of an embodiment of the present invention, the following terms used in the specification and claims herein shall be defined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Installed&rdquo; shall mean connected to an electrical system which is otherwise significantly operative of an automobile. The electrical system can be functional to at least some extent when the automobile is not in use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> A &ldquo;predetermined operating condition&rdquo; of an automobile can be any condition in which an automobile may be, such as: off, on, moving, on but stationary, on but having been stationary for a predetermined period of time, in gear or in park or neutral, etc. &ldquo;Turned on&rdquo; shall mean that the automobile is being interacted with by a user; it need not mean that the engine of the automobile is running. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Signals&rdquo; or &ldquo;image signals&rdquo; shall mean electrical or wireless signals which can in some way be interpreted as image data. As such, the signals can be in a CCITT facsimile format, a digital format such as TIFF, ASCII, Microsoft&reg; Word&trade;, pdf, JPEG, or any format that comes into use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A &ldquo;printer&rdquo; shall be defined as a set of hardware and software which accepts data of any format or combination of formats and renders therefrom an image on a substrate, such as paper. Any printing technology, such as xerography or ink-jet, can be contemplated. Typically such a printer will include a paper supply. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> An &ldquo;input scanner&rdquo; or &ldquo;scanner&rdquo; is any device which records an image and renders it as digital data. Typically such a scanner includes a paper feeding mechanism and a photosensitive device. In the claims, the term &ldquo;scanner&rdquo; can include digital cameras of any kind. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Station-to-station communication&rdquo; means communication between a source and a specifically addressed destination. Examples of this include cellular telephony or electronic mail, although other types of communication may come under this definition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Direct wireless communication&rdquo; means wireless communication from a wireless (such as radio, microwave, or IR) transmitter to one or a large number of possible receivers. This term includes ground- or satellite-based systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Displaying&rdquo; can mean any type of visual, audio or other direct communication to a human user. As such, the term can include showing a message on an electronic (such as LCD) display, printing out a message with a printer, or giving an audio signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The &ldquo;title&rdquo; associated with any set of data is any relatively small set of data (such as a few words) which identifies, or even notes the existence of (e.g., &ldquo;You have electronic mail&rdquo;), a larger set of data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> A &ldquo;selection interface&rdquo; is any means by which a user in an automobile can interact with the document device in the automobile, such as use of hard buttons, touchscreen, voice commands, or submitting a hard-copy sheet with instructions thereon to a scanner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a systems view of various elements of what can be called a &ldquo;document device&rdquo; according to an embodiment of the present invention. The document device is intended to be installed in an automobile, as described above. The document device is operatively associated with electrical system <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> of a particular automobile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The main hardware elements of a typical document device are a printer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, input scanner <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> (which could accept inputs from a digital camera such as <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>), and a display <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. As will be shown below, these hardware elements are advantageously These elements are controlled via a CPU <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, although depending on a particular implementation, the CPU can comprise one or more microprocessors or other devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The CPU <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> further controls other data-handling elements, which in turn can accept data from scanner <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> or send data to printer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Such elements can include a fax board <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, an e-mail server <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, and a browser <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. As is well known, any of these elements can be comprised of hardware and software for its purpose. Any of these elements can in turn make use of an on-board memory <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, which can be of any type (or combination of types) known in the art, specific uses of which will be described in detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The CPU <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> further controls communication devices, for sending or receiving data of various formats and types from outside the automobile. Among these devices, according to various implementations, can be a cellular telephone device <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, a satellite or other direct-wireless transceiver <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, and a device <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> for exploiting the Global Positioning System (GPS), such as to locate the automobile at a point on the Earth. Data going to or from these devices can interact with the data-handling elements as needed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows how a document device such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> would look as installed in the dashboard of an automobile. Slots for paper output from printer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and circulation of sheets through scanner <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are apparent, as well as display <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, which can be in the form of a touch-screen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> A document device, having any or all of the above-described elements, can perform functions which are uniquely suited for the context of communicating to and from an automobile. A number of scenarios, and how the document device operates within them according to the present invention, will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> One unique situation which occurs when a document device is installed in an automobile is if image data is submitted from an external source while the car is effectively &ldquo;off.&rdquo; With modern automobiles, there is always residual electrical activity (clock, alarm system) going on even when the key is not in the ignition and the engine is off; but to print out a document (such as an incoming facsimile) while the car is in such a condition may cause an unacceptable drain on the car&apos;s battery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> According to one aspect of the present invention, image data of whatever format entering the automobile by whatever means (cell phone <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, satellite transceiver <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, etc.) is stored in memory <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. When the car is subsequently turned on, the display <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> shows a message to the effect that a facsimile, e-mail message or satellite broadcast message has arrived in memory, and solicits the user to print out the related image. The user can assent to the printout through a selection interface, as defined above. The image data is then accessed from memory <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and printed out via printer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Alternately, printout of all received e-mails, faxes, and other messages can be made automatic upon turning on the car. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In some jurisdictions, certain activities, such as use of a telephone, which may interfere with use of a car, may be forbidden. For safety reasons, the apparatus according to the present invention may provide restrictions on the use of certain aspects of the apparatus, depending on the operating condition of the automobile at a given time. For example, a display <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> may be disabled when the car is moving, in gear, or if the motor is running, so that a driver of the car will not be distracted by the display. If the display <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is thus unavailable at a particular time, a message that would be displayed for any reason can alternately be printed out via printer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>; or, the system can wait until the car is stationary (either when detecting the car is in park, or if the car has been stationary for a certain amount of time) before displaying a message. Alternately, messages which would otherwise be displayed can be converted, such as through voice-simulation-technology accessible to CPU <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, to audio messages played to the driver while the car is moving. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Another scenario facilitated by the document device is remote retrieval of documents. A user in an automobile who wishes to obtain a document from a remote source (such as the computer at some home base) can contact the source by means such as cell phone <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>: in such a case, the user can deal with a human representative at the source, or perhaps dial in a special number through the phone system. In response thereto, the source sends the desired image data to the document device in any format, such as facsimile, ASCII, or pdf. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> A variation of this scenario is that the source sends the desired information which is subsequently combined with image data pre-stored in memory <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, yielding a complete document. This method is useful when printing sales collaterals: information relating the standard brochure for a product being sold can be retained in memory <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, while up-to-date pricing or availability information is sent upon request. The pricing information can be delivered to the document device in a highly space-efficient format, such as ASCII characters, which are then formatted within a larger document having a more sophisticated format such as pdf, yielding a seamless image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Another variation of the remote-retrieval concept is to have the user in the car directly access a desired image to be printed, by navigating the World-Wide Web. The most straightforward way to do this, given the state of common technology at the time of filing hereof, would be to use the cell-phone device <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> as a fax modem to a laptop or other computer within the car. As this may prove expensive, a service could be provided in which communication to and from the car, either through cell-phone or other technology, is minimized given a particular purpose, with the &ldquo;service,&rdquo; residing at a home base, performing any communication-intensive activities. For instance, if a salesman in a car wanted a relatively unusual document from the internet (sales collateral from a competitor&apos;s website, for example), instead of navigating the internet in a manner which could consume a large amount of cell-phone time, he contacts the service and selects, either by speaking with or faxing to a human representative or by using a relatively simple selection screen on display <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> (or even using a paper-based checklist interface scanned into scanner <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>) a general request of a type of information he wants. Subsequently, the service locates the desired data and sends it to the car in whatever format (fax, ASCII, pdf, etc.) is most desirable under a given set of circumstances. The data can arrive at the car while the car is moving or parked, to be made available for printing when the car is in a predetermined operating condition (the car being turned on, if the car were parked when the data arrived; or the car becoming parked, if the car were moving when the data arrived). It is also possible that a user in a first car could request of the service that the desired data be sent to a second car. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The GPS capability within an automobile, such as provided by GPS device <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> within a particular automobile, can facilitate another scenario, the printing of location-based documents. GPS device <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> can inform CPU <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of the precise location of the automobile at all times. This information can be exploited in situations where an image is desired to be sent only to automobiles within a certain area. For instance, if a central office wanted to send a document to only those automobiles in the Chicago metropolitan area, the data for the document could be broadcast by satellite or broadcast-faxed to in effect every car in a much wider area, along with an instruction for each document device to retain the data in memory <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> for printing only if the automobile is in the desired geographical range, as determined by the GPS device <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> within each car. Those cars which are determined, by their on-board GPS devices, to be outside the desired geographical range, may receive data, but (depending on the specific implementation, as manifested in their CPU&apos;s) will not store the data in memory <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, or will accept the data but not solicit the user to print it out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> A more sophisticated variation of location-based documents is to cause the document devices in each of a population of cars to print somewhat different documents depending on the determined location of each car as determined by the GPS device <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. An overview of the location-dependent printing scenario is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. For instance, a central office wants to call a set of emergency meetings of its sales force who are out in a fleet of automobiles. Salesmen should report to the local office closest to where they happen to be at the moment. Using the document device of the present invention in each car, a single broadcast message (fax or satellite) is sent out to the fleet, and within each document device the GPS location is noted. Depending on the determined location of a particular document device, different subsets of the total broadcast message can be printed, most likely only those portions of the broadcast message relevant to persons within a particular area (in the claim language, this comes under the category of &ldquo;affecting an aspect&rdquo; of the image signals to be printed). In the sales force example, those cars which are near Chicago would have printed out for them (through printer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) only a map showing how to get to the Chicago meeting, while cars near Indianapolis would have printed out only a map showing how to get to the Indianapolis meeting, and cars in neither area would not have printed out anything; yet, in the single broadcast message, information relating to both meetings would have been sent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Within each car in a population of cars spread over a geographical area, discriminating software within CPU <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> receives from the central source (either through satellite communication or a broadcast fax) a single message, comprising image data in any format, which has further associated therewith special instructions about the location dependence of the message. The potentially printable portion of the message is retained in memory <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. The special instructions are addressed to appropriate software controlled by CPU <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. These special instructions can be summarized as: if location of car &equals;&lsqb;predetermined geographical area&rsqb;, then retrieve from memory and print &lsqb;predetermined subset of message data&rsqb;; there can be as many if-then statements as different location-specific versions of the message. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> A variation of the technique is to have a central source send only the special instructions to the population of cars, and have the printable image data pre-loaded in memory <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>: in other words, the central source would simply instruct the document device in each car to print out a pre-loaded message (the nature of which may be made dependent on the location of the car as determined by the GPS device in each car). Once again, in this and all scenarios, if a particular car is &ldquo;off&rdquo; when the device therein receives the message or instructions, when the car is turned on, the device displays a message to the user that a message has been received, and the user will have the option to print it out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Another set of scenarios according to the present invention involve location-based input scanning services. If it is desired to record a hard-copy document image through scanner <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, or other types of image through digital camera <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, the resulting image data can be sent (in any format, such as facsimile, ASCII or pdf characters as a result of an optical character recognition process, etc.) to an external location in a manner which is dependent on the location of the document device at the time of the scanning operation, as determined by GPS device <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. A simple implementation of the above scenario is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. For instance, if an insurance adjuster operating from her automobile wishes to transmit an image of an auto insurance card from some essentially random location, information from the GPS device <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> at the time of scanning can be used both to provide a time and location stamping of the transmission of the image data; and further, to enable the destination of the scanned image data to be automatically and invisibly dependent on the location from which the information was scanned. If the insurance company is set up so that car accidents which occur in New York should be reported to one fax number, while accidents which occur in New Jersey should be reported to another fax number. (The system could also conceivably work with a scan-to-email system.) Assuming the adjuster will be scanning and transmitting the insurance cards from a location very close to the accident scene, the GPS system can be used to determine the exact location of the accident, and thereby direct the information to the correct fax number, all invisibly to the adjuster using the document device in her car. </paragraph>
