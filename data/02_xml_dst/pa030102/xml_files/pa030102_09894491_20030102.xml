<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A number of improved excess flow valves are disclosed wherein the flow around a magnet holding portion of the valve body is generally unrestricted to reduce the pressure drop across the valve. The valve is preferably also formed separately from its valve seat to reduce the complexity of the valve, and allow it to have less resistance to flow. The valve seat may be provided as a separate part, or may be provided in the conduit. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to excess flow valves for controlling flow through a conduit wherein the valve minimizes the pressure drop through the valve and also reduces the number of parts typically required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Excess flow valves are utilized to limit the amount of fluid flow through a conduit. Generally, some way of holding the valve in a generally open position maintains the valve in an open position allowing flow through the conduit if the volume flow through the conduit is below predetermined limit. If the volume flow increases above the limit, or stated another way, if the pressure drop across the valve exceeds a certain value, then the valve is moved to a closed position restricting flow through the conduit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> One type of excess flow valve uses a magnet to hold the valve at a generally opened position. The typical prior art magnetic excess flow valve has been incorporated into a capsule, wherein the entire structure for providing a valve seat, a valve guide, and a magnet holder are all incorporated as a single capsule item. Inevitably, the prior art has resulted in undesirably high pressure drop across the valve due to the high number of parts received in the flow path in this prior art type valve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In addition, the prior art valves have had non-symmetric structure such that inadvertent resistance to flow has resulted due to variations in the orientation of the various valve components. This is undesirable. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In disclosed embodiments of this invention, a simplified excess flow valve is provided which results in a relatively small pressure drop across the valve assembly. This is achieved by reducing the number of parts, and eliminating restriction to flow through the conduit due to the valve assembly to the extent possible when the valve is open. In preferred embodiments, a first body portion incorporating a valve guide and a magnet holder is separate from the valve seat. In some embodiments the valve seat may be provided by a separate valve seat, and in other embodiments the valve seat is provided by a surface in one of the conduit halves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In the second type of inventive embodiments, the valve is preferably mounted at a connection between two conduit portions, such that the valve seat may be provided at one of those two conduit portions. Moreover, there is less structure at the outer periphery of the valve to disrupt or otherwise provide a restriction to flow. Generally, the excess flow valves allow flow around the outer periphery of the valves when the valve is in its open position. The prior art has had structure in the way of the flow, which results in undesirably high pressure drop. The present invention incorporates its valve guiding function with a plurality of circumferentially spaced legs extending radially inwardly from a radially outer portion. This structure presents less of a restriction to flow than the prior art, which generally extends it along the entire circumference of the valve. With the present invention there is thus less disruption or other resistance to flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> These and other features of the present invention can be best understood from the following specification and drawings, the following of which is a brief description. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an excess flow valve <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is positioned within a conduit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. A first body portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> provides a valve seat at <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The outer periphery <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the valve seat portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> engages the inner periphery of a conduit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. A fluid guide portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has a generally cylindrical portion also engaging the inner periphery of the conduit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Circumferentially spaced arms <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) extend inwardly. These arms hold a magnet <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. A frustro-conical web <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> connects the legs, and inner ends <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> clip the magnet <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. A disk valve <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is movable inwardly of the legs and toward the valve seat <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. As can be seen, fluid can flow through an opening <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> generally around the entire circumference of the valve <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> except as blocked by <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Preferably the valve is generally cylindrical such that it is symmetrical. In this way, there will be little or no variation in the resistance to flow through the passage <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, and the pressure drop across the valve will be minimized compared to the prior art. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the magnet <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is held within each of the plurality of arms <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. As can be further appreciated from this view, the magnet <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is also held by several clips <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The valve <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> in perspective view. As can be appreciated, the arms <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> have an outer peripheral portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> which contacts the inner periphery of the conduit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. A further connecting portion <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> also contacts the inner periphery. The arms <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> extend radially inwardly to the frustro-conical web <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, and the magnet clips <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are positioned spaced from the web <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The valve plate <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is guided by the arms, for movement toward and away from the valve seat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the magnet is held by clips <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> each extending inwardly from frusto-conical web <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The circumferentially spaced arms <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> present less resistance to flow through the passage <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> than did the prior art which circumferentially surrounded the valve. Further, by utilizing a separate valve seat the present invention provides a simple valve assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows another embodiment taken along <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the conduit is shown to be a two-part conduit <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. A threaded connection <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is formed between the two conduit portions while a recess <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> is formed into the face of one of the conduit portions. A valve seat <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> is provided radially inwardly of the recess. An opposed end surface <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> of the other conduit half <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> captures a valve assembly <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. While the valve assembly <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is shown axially captured, the outer periphery of the valve body <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> could also be formed to be an interference fit within the conduit <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, and such that the conduit body <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> need not be positioned at any particular axial location relative to the conduit <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The valve body <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> holds a magnet <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> adjacent a valve plate <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the body <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> does not have arm portions <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> around its entire circumference. Instead, as is the case with the prior embodiment, the arms <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> are circumferentially spaced. An outer portion <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight> is received between the conduit halves <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a view looking from the right hand side toward the left of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. Shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the valve is positioned aligned with a central cylindrical web <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>, which is preferably a relatively small diameter compared to the valve plate <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows the valve assembly <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, and the arms <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> extending to the magnet <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight>. This view is from the right looking to the left. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows yet another embodiment <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. In embodiment <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> a separate valve seat <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is provided along with a separate valve guide and magnet holder portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. The magnet <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is received in a space provided by several circumferentially spaced arms <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. A plate retainer structure <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is provided at the forward end of the valve guide. The plate <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> moves forwardly and selectively seats against a valve seat <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, when the valve seat is positioned to extend radially inwardly of the plate retainer <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, there may be cut portions <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> circumferentially spaced around the portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> of the valve retainer body <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. These portions will facilitate the clipping movement of the plate <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> inwardly of the plate retainer portions <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Although preferred embodiments of this invention have been disclosed, a worker in this art would recognize that certain modifications would come within the scope of this invention. For that reason the following claims should be studied the true scope and content of this invention. </paragraph>
