<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">This invention relates to electrically connecting a first electronic component to a second electronic component wherein at least one of the electronic components must undergo modifications or repair when, for example, there is a floating signal generated from the first electronic component which can cause problems in operation of the electronic component assembly. For this type assembly an opening is provided in the second electronic component proximate the site or sites to be electrically connected to the first electronic component, which opening extends to an internal plane of the second electronic component desired to be connected to the first electronic component. A wire having a melting point higher than the solder used to make the assembly is used to connect the internal plane of the second electronic component to the pad of the second electronic component which second electronic component is to be electrically connected to the first electronic component thereby avoiding a floating signal in the electronic component assembly. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to electrically connecting one electronic component to another electronic component and, more particularly, to attaching a BGA module having floating signals to unconnected surface BGA pads on a printed circuit board. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The use of solder to join materials such as components of an electronic structure is well known in the art. In the electronics area there are a myriad of electronic components which require connection to other electronic components or to other levels of packaging. Examples include mounting of integrated circuit chips to a metallized substrate, multi-layer ceramic substrate (MLC), laminate organic substrate, glass ceramic substrate, card (direct-chip-attach, DCA), printed circuit board (PCB) and any substrate made of composite materials meeting thermal and mechanical properties. This description will be directed to for convenience to second level surface mount technology whereby a ball grid array (BGA) containing component is electrically connected to a printed circuit board. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The term Ball Grid Arrays (BGA&apos;s) refers to a broad class of microelectronic substrate modules that are connected to a board/card by means of an array of solder balls on the module. Such interconnections are first formed by joining solder balls to the substrate module thus creating the BGA. The BGA is subsequently joined to the PCB or card during reflow assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Printed circuit boards (PCB&apos;s) or printed wiring boards (PWB&apos;s) are rigid or flexible single, double or multi-layered boards having printed conductors placed upon or within the board material. A PCB is designed to receive separately manufactured electrical components and to interconnect those components in an overall circuit structure. The joining of such components or parts is well-known in the electronics art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> PCB&apos;s are classified by the number of layers they contain as implied by the terms single-sided, double-sided and multi-layered boards. Multi-layer PCB&apos;s typically have internal interconnected conductor circuits and internal ground or power planes, as well as conductors on both sides of the board. Most industrial and commercial PCB&apos;s are manufactured from rigid copper-clad epoxy-impregnated glass fiber or a phenolic-impregnated laminate. The leads or wires from components to be joined to the board can be surface mounted or connected at plated-through holes at the terminal ends of each conductor. In a multi-layer setting, terminal ends of conductors connect at vias which extend from a buried conductor plan to a surface layer. From the surface layer, each via can be connected to an overlying electrical component by a BGA array. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Assemblies containing a circuit board and a Ball Grid Array (BGA) module typically must undergo modifications or repair. For example, a module to be connected may have an open internal net (typically referred to as a floating signal) that should actually be connected to another net, a reference voltage, supply voltage, or ground potential of a printed circuit board. Furthermore, engineering changes might be necessary once the circuit is in its operating environment. Typically, such circuit boards are discarded and replaced with new boards fabricated to include the modification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Bearing in mind the problems and deficiencies of the prior art, it is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a method for electrically connecting one electronic component to another electronic component using solder interconnections, wherein one of the components must be adapted or repaired before component assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the present invention to provide a method for connecting a floating signal BGA pad of a component to an internal ground or voltage plane in a printed circuit board to which the component is to be connected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A further object of the invention is to provide electronic structures made using the solder interconnection structure and method of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Still other objects and advantages of the invention will in part be obvious and will in part be apparent from the specification. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S) </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In describing the preferred embodiment of the present invention, reference will be made herein to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>C of the drawings in which like numerals refer to like features of the invention. Features of the invention are not necessarily shown to scale in the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> cross-sectional view of a typical printed circuit board (PCB) is shown. The printed circuit board <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of layers <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>having a top surface layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and a top printed circuit layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A bottom surface layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and bottom printed circuit layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is also shown with a plated-through hole <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which permits connections between various levels of internal circuitry <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the multiple layer PCB <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> For simplicity, the present invention will be described with respect to the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> employing a dog bone design where the solder pad and solder ball connections thereon are offset from the plated-through holes in the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. An alternate design would have the solder balls axially aligned with the plated through holes in the printed circuit board. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> plan view of a typical PCB <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is shown. The top surface <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> has thereon a dog bone design <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> comprising a pad <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, a plated via <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and a connector <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The pads will accept solder balls to form the BGA grid for the module to be connected to the PCB. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A, 3B</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>C, the method of the invention and the resulting electronic component assembly of the invention can be demonstrated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference> shows a plan view of a typical printed circuit board <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The top surface layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> contains a number of pads <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> connected by a connecting strap <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to a via <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Pad <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is a surface pad that does not have a connected via and is isolated from the internal planes of the circuit board <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and is the pad to be adapted using the method of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference> shows a plan view of the repaired or modified printed circuit board <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Thus, the pads <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and vias <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> are shown still connected together using connecting strap <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and these have not been changed. The isolated pad <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is now connected to an internal plane of the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through a via <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> which has been drilled to a depth to reach the desired internal plane to be connected to the pad <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. A connecting wire <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is used to connect the internal plane of printed circuit board <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through via <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to pad <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. A solder fillet <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is used to secure the wire <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> to pad <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C, a</cross-reference> side view of the repaired printed circuit board <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference> is shown. Firstly, a BGA containing module is shown generally as <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and comprises a substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> having a pad <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> thereon. The pad has a C4 solder ball <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, or a copper ball or other connector may also be used as is known in the art, connected to the pad by solder fillet <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Solder ball <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is positioned directly above pad <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of printed circuit board <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for attachment of the solder ball <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> to pad <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</cross-reference> shows the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having a number of dielectric layers <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>and internal circuit or plane layers shown generally as <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The printed circuit board <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has an upper layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> having a pad <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> thereon and the lower layer is shown having a bottom surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Via hole <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> was drilled through the top surface <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of printed circuit board <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through the first layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and terminated at internal layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>which is typically a ground plane in a printed circuit board. The opening in the printed circuit board may be drilled in a BGA siren or area array. A solder fillet <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> was used secure a wire <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> extending from the fillet <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to pad <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The wire <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is secured to pad <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by solder fillet <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. Both solder fillets <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> would typically be the same solder and is preferably a higher melting temperature solder than the solder of solder ball <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and solder fillet <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of substrate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The connecting wire <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> also preferably has a higher melting temperature than the connecting solder ball <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> or solder fillets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Once the connecting wire <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is secured thereto as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B and 3C</cross-reference>, the BOA containing module <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to be secured to the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is positioned above PCB <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and solder attached thereto using conventional reflow procedures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The present invention solves the problem of attaching floating signals from a BGA module to unconnected surface BGA pads on a circuit board. Typically the error is made on the circuit board design, and these pads are not connected to the ground plane of the board by vias. The advantage of using this invention is the verification of grounding the floating signals without the delay of making new printed circuit boards. The invention does not require a change in the BOA containing module or the technique in attaching or re-attaching the module to the PCB. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The connecting wire <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is preferably a wire such as copper or copper alloy but may be any suitable connector material in any shape, with the proviso that the melting point be higher than the melting point of the solder used to connect the BGA module to the PCB. The thickness of the wire may vary widely and is typically about 3 to 5 mils. Similarly, the solder used to hold the wire to the internal plane of the PCB pad will be a higher melting point than the attach solder of the BGA module. Other methods of wire attach could be used such as laser welding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> While the present invention has been particularly described, in conjunction with a specific preferred embodiment, it is evident that many alternatives, modifications and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art in light of the foregoing description. It is therefore contemplated that the appended claims will embrace any such alternatives, modifications and variations as falling within the true scope and spirit of the present invention. </paragraph>
