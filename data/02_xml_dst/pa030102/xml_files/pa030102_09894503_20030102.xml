<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to surgical needles and more particularly relates to phacoemulsification needles which provide improved irrigation and reduced risk of corneal or scleral tissue damage during cataract removal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Cataracts cause the lens of an eye to become clouded and a common practice to alleviate this condition is by surgically removing the cataractic lens and replacing it with an artificial interocular lens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Early lens removal was effected through manual extraction which required a wound of about 12 mm in length. This large opening can result in corneal or scleral tissue damage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Phacoemulsification enables the removal of a cataractic lens through a much smaller incision, for example between about 2.5 to about 4 mm. In this procedure, a needle is inserted through the incision into a lens capsule and the needle is ultrasonically vibrated to mechanically emulsify the lens. Once fragmented, or emulsified, the lens material is aspirated through a lumen through the phacoemulsification needle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> While emulsifying the lens and aspirating lens fragments, a simultaneous flow of irrigation fluid into the lens capsule is provided around the needle through an annulus established by a sleeve concentrically disposed over the needle. This flow of liquid into the eye is necessary to prevent collapse of the interior chamber of the eye during aspiration. In addition, the irrigation fluid cools the needle in order to prevent any thermal damage of the corneal or scleral tissue. While the sleeve surrounding a phacoemulsification needle provides the important function of establishing an annulus for introducing irrigation fluid into the lens capsule and also enlarges the overall diameter of the sleeve needle for which an incision must be made. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In addition, when irrigation fluid is introduced proximate the emulsifying needle tip, the immediate area in front of the needle is roiled. This occurs because of the counter-current flow of fluid being aspirated by the needle itself and the irrigation fluid being introduced over the surface of the needle. Needle vibration causes a cloud of debris which is roiled by the incoming infusion fluid which lessons the physicians visual acuity of the end of the needle which can slow the procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The present invention overcomes the drawbacks of a sleeved phacoemulsification needle. </paragraph>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Apparatus for the phacoemulsification of lens tissue in accordance with the present invention generally includes a first needle for introducing an irrigation fluid into a lens capsule and a second ultrasonically vibrated needle for inserting into the lens capsule for emulsifying the lens tissue therein. The second needle includes a lumen therethrough for aspiration of a emulsified lens tissue and irrigation fluid from the lens capsule through a primary aspiration port defined by an end of the lumen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Also provided is at least one secondary aspiration port disposed in the second needle in a spaced apart relationship with the primary aspiration port for introducing emulsified lens and irrigation fluid into the lumen. Because the apparatus in accordance with the present invention does not include a sleeve surrounding the ultrasonically vibrated needle, a smaller incision or wound is required in the cornea or sclera. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In addition, because irrigation fluid is not simultaneous introduced proximate the second emulsifying needle, no disturbance or churning of fluids occurs which may provide for a &ldquo;milky cloud&rdquo; at the end of the needle which may tend to lesson visual acuity which may interfere with the accuracy of the phacoemulsification by a physician. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> More particularly, the cross-sectional area of the secondary aspiration port may be up to 40% of a cross-sectional area of the primary aspiration port. This insures that a dominant portion of the aspirated fluid occurs through the primary aspiration port. If the primary aspiration port becomes occluded, the secondary aspiration port maintains fluid flow through the needle to insure cooling thereof to prevent any overheating of cornea or scleral tissue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> More particularly, the secondary aspiration port may be disposed within 7 mm of the primary aspiration port to insure that both ports are present in the lens capsule during phacoemulsification procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the apparatus in accordance with the present invention may include multiple secondary aspiration ports in the second needle and a total cross-sectional of the multiple secondary aspiration ports may be up to 40% of the cross-sectional area of the primary aspiration port. All of the multiple secondary aspiration ports may be disposed within 9 mm of the primary aspiration port. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the present invention, the multiple secondary aspiration ports may be disposed in a spaced apart radial relationship with one another circumferally around the second needle.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, there is shown apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for the phacoemulsification of lens tissue <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which includes a first needle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for introducing an irrigation fluid indicated by the arrow <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> into a lens capsule <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Manipulation of the needle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is effected through a handpiece <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> which communicates to a control console <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> through an irrigation line <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The control console <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may be of any suitable type as for example, one manufactured by Allergan, Inc., under the tradename Sovereign&reg;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Also shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, as well as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, is a second needle <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> which is ultrasonically vibrated by a handpiece <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Any suitable handpiece may be utilized such as for example, one sold by Allergan, Inc., under the trade name Sovereign&reg; handpiece. The handpiece <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is interconnected to the console <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and control thereby through an aspiration line <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and a power line <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> for controlling ultrasonic power delivered to the needle <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> by the handpiece <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The second needle <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> fragments or emulsifies the cataractic lens <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which is then aspirated along with irrigation fluid through a lumen <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in the needle <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> as indicated by the arrow <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Because the needle <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> does not include a conventional sleeve (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>) a smaller incision or wound <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is required. The wound size may be as small as 1.25 mm which is to be compared with conventional sleeved needles (not shown) which would require a slit or wound opening, of about 2&frac12; to 3 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As more clearly shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the needle <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> includes a primary aspiration port <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> defined by the lumen <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and one or more secondary aspiration ports <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> disposed along a length <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the needle <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> between the primary aspiration port <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and a hub <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> for attachment of the needle <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to the handpiece <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The secondary aspiration ports <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> may be spaced apart axially from the primary aspiration port and one another as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> or, alternatively, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> aspiration ports <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> may be disposed along the needle <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in a spaced apart radial relationship with one another resulting in aspiration of fluid from the lens capsule <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in opposing direction as indicated by the arrows <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The secondary aspiration ports <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> also provide an important function in maintaining the fluid flow through the needle should the primary aspiration port <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> become excluded. This insures cooling of the needle <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to prevent overheating thereof. Preferably, the secondary aspiration ports <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> are disposed within 7 mm of the primary aspiration port to insure that their aspirating functionality is performed within the lens capsule <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In order to insure that the majority of aspiration occurs through the primary aspiration port, it is preferred that the total cross-sectional area of the secondary aspiration ports <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> be no more than 10% of the cross-sectional area of the primary aspiration port <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The advantages of the unsleeved needle <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are more clearly understood with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates smooth laminar flow of aspiration fluid as shown by the arrows <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> into the primary aspiration port <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and secondary aspiration ports <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> This is to be contrasted with a conventional phacoemulsification needle <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> which is surrounded by a sleeve <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> for the introduction of irrigation fluid proximate an aspiration port <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> as indicated by the arrows <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. Irrigation fluid is also introduced through ports <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, also indicated by arrows <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. As illustrated, aspiration of fluid as indicated by the arrows <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> may be partially diverted from the port <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> before entering which causes a roiling of the fluid indicated by the arrows <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>. This roiling of fluid causes a &ldquo;milky cloud&rdquo; to appear proximate the needle <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> which interferes with the physician acuity of the needle <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> which interferes with efficient phacoemulsification of lens tissue, not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Although there has been hereinabove described apparatus for the phacoemulsification of lens tissue in accordance with the present invention for the purposes of illustrating in which the manner in which the invention may be used to an advantage, it will be appreciated that the invention is not limited thereto. Accordingly, any and all modifications, variations, or equivalent arrangements which may occur to those skilled in the art should be considered to be within the scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims. </paragraph>
