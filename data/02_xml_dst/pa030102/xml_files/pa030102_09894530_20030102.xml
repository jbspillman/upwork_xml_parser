<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to the field of gem settings in general, and particularly to a securing member that is used to maintain a gem in a secure fashion in a piece of jewelry without obscuring the luster of the gem. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Gem setting normally comprise a number of metal prongs or legs radiating from a base, ends of the prongs to be bent over and hold captive a stone, without unduly concealing the stone&apos;s surface. A conventional method for forming settings for jewels and the like involves soldering to a shank of a ring on opposing sides of the jewel. A faceted gemstone or the like is then forced into the opposing prongs which are then bent over to maintain the gemstone therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The prong settings have several drawbacks. The prongs can be caught on items of clothing and separated from its secure connecting with the gemstone and as a result the gemstone will be loosened or lost. In addition, using the prong system especially with larger gemstones or odd shaped gemstones requires the prongs to have a longer length and results in less force being exerted upon the gemstone. Furthermore, the longer length of the prongs also decreases the leverage thereof and it becomes more susceptible to torsional forces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The prior art does not address the need for using a gemstone setting that is able to securely maintain the gemstone within a piece of jewelry. In addition, the prior art fails to provide an inexpensive way of maintaining the gemstone within the setting. Therefore, there remains a long standing and continuing need for an advance in the art of gemstone settings that is simpler in both design and use, is more economical, efficient in its construction and use, and eliminates the accidental loosening or loss of gemstones. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is a general object of the present invention to overcome the disadvantages of the prior art. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 2</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, therein is illustrated a first member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for receiving a gemstone <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> therein. Gemstone <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may any article that is to be maintained within first member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> such as, but not limited to, a precious, semi-precious, or non-precious stone. For purposes of illustration, but not limitation, gemstone <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be a diamond, ruby, sapphire, emerald, topaz, tanzanite, peridot, citrine, or cubic zirconia. It is also to be understood that the shape and the size of gemstone of <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may vary and are not limited. First member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has an outer surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and an inner surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> whereby a cavity <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is axially defined by inner surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and extending therethrough. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Inner surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and outer surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are joined at a first edge <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a second edge <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> at opposing ends thereof. First edge <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and second edge <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> also define cavity <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. First edge <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is sufficiently smaller in diameter than second edge <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> such that gemstone <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be inserted through second edge <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> yet received and maintained by first edge <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> within cavity <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. At least an extension <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> extends from inner surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and is substantially axially parallel with cavity <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and is preferably more proximal to first edge <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and extends towards second edge <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. In another preferred embodiment, there are at least two extensions <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>; however, there may be a plurality of extensions <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> as required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> After a gemstone <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is received within first edge <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a first element <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is attached to extension <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in a plane that is perpendicular thereto. First element <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is preferably a thin elongated member that is enclosed upon itself to define an opening <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> therein. First element <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is attached to extension <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in any fashion that is known in the art such as, but not limited to, soldering. The size and shape of first element <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may be altered to accommodate any size or shaped gemstone <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> within opening <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> such that gemstone <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> does not pass completely therethrough. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In addition, extensions <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may also be bent such that they are angled inwardly so that the distance between opposing extensions <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is less than the distance between opposing sides of first edge <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In such an arrangement, a bottom end <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> that is distal to a top end <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of gemstone <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be accommodated by an opening <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of first element <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> having a smaller diameter than cavity <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of first member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, first element <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> acts as a securing member to maintain gemstone <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in a setting in a secure fashion such that extensions <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are not easily pried open and their grip on gemstone <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is not defeated. In such an arrangement, gemstone <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> cannot fall out of the setting as a result of the failure of extensions <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, a second member <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is adapted to receive first member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> therein. Second member <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> has a first end <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and a second end <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> interconnected by a middle portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. First end <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and second end <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are bent around middle portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> such that they oppose one another to form a gap <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> therebetween. First member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is adapted to be received within gap <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and to be securely attached to first end <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and second end <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. In such an arrangement, an aperture <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is defined by first end <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, middle portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, second end <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, and first member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Aperture <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> may be of sufficient size to accommodate a finger, a wrist, an ankle, or a neck of a user therein. In other words, first member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be adapted to fit onto any piece of jewelry such as, but not limited to, a ring, a bracelet, an anklet, a necklace, or a brochure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> First member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may also have at least a protrusion <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> extending from outer surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> thereof and being adapted to be received within a corresponding recess <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> on at least first end <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and second end <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> for a more secure attachment. First member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and second member <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may be connected in any fashion that is known in the art such as, but not limited to, soldering or adhesives. The various parts of first member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, second member <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and first element <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may be of any precious, semi-precious or non-precious materials, such as but not limited to, platinum, gold, silver, metals, and various alloys. The type of material used for first member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, second member <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and first element <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are not critical to the invention and are interchangeable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Now referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>, in another preferred embodiment, first member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and second member <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may be one integral unit whereby they may be cast in one unitary piece without the requirement of a connection therebetween. In such an embodiment, cavity <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is again defined by first edge <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and extends through second edge <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. At least an extension <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> extends from inner surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and is adapted to maintain first element <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in the same horizontal plane as first edge <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> such that cavity <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and opening <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are axially aligned. Gemstone <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may now be secured within and partially through cavity <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> as previously described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Now referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, in a rear view it is illustrated that gemstone <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is securely maintained by extensions <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and first element <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. It can be appreciated that cavity <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be adapted to accommodate a gemstone <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that is cut in any shape that is known in the art or yet to be developed. In addition, first element <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may also be adapted to accommodate and securely retain a gemstone <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that is cut in any shape that is known in the art or yet to be developed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Now referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</cross-reference>, illustrates an alternate preferred embodiment for first member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. First edge <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> receives and maintains gemstone <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> within cavity <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. At least an extension <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> extends from second edge <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and is adapted to receive first element <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> thereon to secure bottom end <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of gemstone <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> within opening <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. In addition, an attaching member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is secured to outer surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of first member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> such that a hole is defined by attaching member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. A elongated member (not shown) such as a chain may be passed through hole <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of attaching means <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> such that first member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be worn as a pendant around the neck of a user. In addition, a plurality of first members <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be interconnected to form a loop that may be worn around the finger, wrist, ankle, belly, or neck of a user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> While the above description contains many specificities, these should not be construed as limitations on the scope of the invention, but rather as an exemplification of one preferred embodiment thereof. Many other variations are possible without departing from the essential spirit of this invention. Accordingly, the scope of the invention should be determined not by the embodiment illustrated, but by the appended claims and their legal equivalents. </paragraph>
