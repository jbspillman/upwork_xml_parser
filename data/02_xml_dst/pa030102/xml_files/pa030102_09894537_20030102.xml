<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> There is an immense variety of prepared food products on the market. These food products are often prepared in a batch process, and some products are prepared using extrusion techniques. The food art contains an enormous amount of disclosures pertaining to the preparation of such prepared food products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Due to the intense competition in the prepared food market, any advantage that can be obtained in the preparation of the product can be extremely valuable. These advantages are often manifested in improvements in efficiency as well as improvement in the quality and taste of the product itself. However, improvements in versatility for the systems and elements used in the production of the food product can also be important. Of course, the advantages are most striking if a design change improves all of the above-mentioned elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Multilayer prepared food products have been popular in recent times. These products are often two layers and are often formed by fairly complicated processes. Such products have often been expensive to produce and the processes are generally not amenable to easy modification so the product is not easily changed to accommodate market dynamics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Therefore, there is a need for a process and system that can efficiently produce a multilayer prepared food product. Still further, there is a need for such a process and system that is amenable to efficient change. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> More specifically, the production of a multi-layer prepared food product having two layers has often been complicated and expensive resulting in an expensive product. To the inventor&apos;s knowledge, there is no multi-layer prepared food product having more than two layers that can be efficiently produced in a cost-effective and versatile manner. Therefore, there is a need for a process and system for efficiently producing a multi-layer prepared food product that has more than two layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Most specifically, to the knowledge of the inventor, no multi-layer prepared food product on the market at the present time simulates a cheeseburger. That is, a food product that has a layer of cheese and a layer of meat sandwiched between two layers of bread. Because of the popularity of cheeseburgers, it is believed that the market for a prepared food product that simulates a cheeseburger will be quite large. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Therefore, there is a need for a process and system for producing a prepared food product that simulates a cheeseburger. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The market for animal-consumable food is nearly as large as the market for human-consumable food. The animal food market has numerous forms of pet treats including treats that simulate many food items that are produced for human consumption. However, to the inventor&apos;s knowledge, there is no prepared food product on the market that is intended for animal consumption that simulates a cheeseburger. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Therefore, there is a need for a prepared food product that is intended for animal consumption that simulates a cheeseburger. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The above-discussed disadvantages and drawbacks are overcome by a system that produces a multi-layer product by forming as many different ingredients as is required for the final product in steps that can be separate from each other and then combining these ingredients in an extrusion die that is formed to flow the separate ingredients in side-by-side flow paths and then combine them where necessary for the final product to be formed. The multi-layer product can thus include more than two layers. Specifically, two of the flow paths are sandwiched by a third flow whereby the final product is in the form of a sandwich with two ingredients in layers between two separate layers of a third ingredient for a total of four layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The overall system is quite versatile because as many ingredients and additives can be added to the die as desired and the die can have multiple flow paths defined therethrough whereby the ingredients are added together in layer form and the layers can be treated as necessary before further layers or further process steps are performed. The final product can be cut into lengths as desired so the final product takes a desired form. Modifying the final overall product is also cost effective because adding or deleting ingredients is efficient to achieve. The amount or type of additives can be easily changed as necessary so the desired overall final product is achieved in a cost effective and efficient manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> A specific example of the food product is an animal food treat that resembles a hamburger, specifically, a cheeseburger. However, while this is the best mode for this invention, those skilled in the art will understand that the teaching of the present disclosure can be applied to any food product, including a food product for human consumption without departing from the scope of this disclosure. Accordingly, it is intended that such other food products are also to be included in the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> As required, detailed embodiments of the present invention are disclosed herein; however, it is to be understood that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. Therefore, specific structural and functional details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting, but merely as a basis for the claims and as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to variously employ the present invention in virtually any appropriately detailed structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The present disclosure provides a system and a process for producing a multi-layer food product that includes at least two layers of one ingredient sandwiching at least one layer of another ingredient to form a final product that is multi-layer and in the form of a sandwich food product. The various ingredients can be formed in separate process steps and then are combined in an extrusion die in layers that are combined into the multi-layer product having distinct layers. The final product is formed by performing steps, such as cutting lengths of the final multi-layer product into predetermined lengths of product, cooking as needed, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Specifically, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is shown for forming a multi-layer food product in accordance with the present invention. System <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a supply <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of dry mix material which is commonly used in forming food-like products. Some of these products include grain, palatability enhancers or the like, and those skilled in the art will understand what type of material is included in the dry mix to produce the final product discussed in this disclosure. Supply <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be in a single container or in several separate containers as necessary. The container can include mixing elements as well as appropriate heating or cooling elements. Dry mix from supply <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is moved to a plurality of different process steps. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, dry mix from supply <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is moved to a first preparation unit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which can be a cooker, including a batch cooker or a product densification unit (PDU) via a conduit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which fluidically connects unit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to supply <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A slurry from slurry container <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is formed using liquid or the like and is fluidically connected to unit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by a conduit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. A pump <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and a meter <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are located in conduit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to move slurry from container <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to unit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The pump and meter can be connected to a suitable control console C via electrical connections, such as connection <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and/or connection EC to control movement of slurry to unit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in accordance with formulas associated with the final product being formed using system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The slurry is combined with the dry product in unit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and is and prepared and formed into a slurry type material that is capable of flowing. A suitable pump, such as pump <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is controlled at console C and is used to move dry mix to the various locations in system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> A conduit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> conducts the slurry type material from unit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to a valve <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> that can be controlled by the control console via a suitable electrical connections, such as electrical connection <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to divert some or all of the slurry type material into conduit <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. Another pump <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is located in conduit <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> to move the slurry type material through conduit <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an additive, such as a food color, or taste enhancers, or food product, or the like, is added to the slurry type material flowing through conduit <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> from a container <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> via a meter <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> that can also be controlled from the system control console mentioned above. Pump <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> moves the slurry type material having the additive therein to a die <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> via a conduit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Die <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is an extrusion die in which cooking is done and which is sized and configured to form the multi-layer product of the present invention from the ingredients flowing thereto as will be understood from the ensuing discussion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> As is also shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also includes a second preparation unit <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> which can be a former or cooker if desired. Unit <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is fluidically connected to unit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> via valve <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and a conduit <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and receives prepared slurry from unit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> via that fluid connection. Unit <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> forms the received material into an appropriate slurry that flows to die <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> via conduit <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. A pump can be included in conduit <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> if necessary. It is also noted that appropriate pumps, meters and valves can be included at various locations throughout system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as needed, and can be controlled from console C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> It is noted that unit <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> can be omitted from some forms of system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In such an embodiment, slurry material from unit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> will be routed directly to die <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> via conduit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and valve <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> which will be fluidically connected to conduit <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> As is also shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> further includes another preparation unit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> fluidically connected to dry mix supply <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by a conduit <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Unit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> can be a cooker, a batch cooker, a PDU or the like as required. A pump and/or a meter can be inserted in conduit <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> as necessary to move material from dry mix supply <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to unit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. System <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes an additive container <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> fluidically connected to unit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> by a conduit <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> in which a pump <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and/or a meter <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is located. In the preferred form of system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, additive from container <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is a meat and preservative mixture and will be referred to as a meat like product. Some preservatives include animal fat, while others include gelatinized starches or the like. Those skilled in the art will understand the ingredients of such a product based on the teaching of the present disclosure. As is also shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, further additives, such as food coloring, taste enhancers, or the like can be added to the material being processed in unit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> from a container <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> via a conduit <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> in which a meter <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and a pump <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> are located to move the material from container <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> to unit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in volumes and at flow rates set at the control console C to correspond to the formula being followed to prepare the food product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Once the material in unit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> has achieved the desired condition, it flows from unit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to die <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> via a conduit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. It is noted that unit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, like units <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> as well as any other units that are included in the system, include appropriate sensors, meters and the like which are electrically connected to console C to relay information to that console. The relayed information is used at the console to control the overall process in accordance with the formulas and relationships being used to prepare the final product as well as the characteristics of the final product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> As will be understood from the present disclosure, all materials flowing to die <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> will be in a form that can flow through conduits to die <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In the preferred form of system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the final food product is in the form of a cheeseburger sandwich. For purposes of this disclosure, a &ldquo;cheeseburger&rdquo; is a sandwich-like product having a layer of cheese-like product on a layer of meat-like product with two layers of bread-like product sandwiching the layers of cheese-like product and meat-like product. It is also noted that any of the products used in the cheeseburger can be constituted in a manner that satisfies FDA definitions whereby the product can be termed &ldquo;cheese,&rdquo; &ldquo;meat&rdquo; or &ldquo;bread&rdquo; under FDA definitions of such terms. Therefore, the term &ldquo;cheeseburger, is intended to include such products as well. The terms that include &ldquo;like&rdquo; are intended to be applied to products and ingredients that are used in preparing products that can be sold with products such as those used for animal consumption or which can be sold for human consumption of such &ldquo;like&rdquo; products. Therefore, material from unit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is turned into a cheese-like product and has a food coloring such as yellow or orange added from container <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> so the product entering die <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> via conduit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> has the appearance and taste of a cheese-like product. Still further, product from unit <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> will resemble bread or a bun when it is added to die <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> via conduit <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Therefore, unit <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> will operate on material in conduit <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> as needed to turn the prepared dry mix slurry from unit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> into a bread-like product. If no such unit is needed and the material from unit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be used as a bread-like product in die <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, unit <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> can be omitted from system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Still further, when a cheeseburger-like product is being formed using system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, dry mix from source <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> will be processed in unit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> with meat-like products as well as preservatives and fat from container <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and coloring and/or flavoring from container <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> to form a meat-like product to be added to die <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> via conduit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> As will be understood from the following discussion, these products are combined in die <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to form a multi-layered product that has at least two layers of the same material sandwiching at least one layer, and preferably two layers, of other materials when the final product exits die <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Die <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Die <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is fluidically connected to conduits <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> to receive materials I<highlight><subscript>C</subscript></highlight>, I<highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>and I<highlight><subscript>M </subscript></highlight>respectively therefrom. Accordingly, die <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> includes a body <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> which includes an inlet port <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> which receives conduit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, an inlet port <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> which receives conduit <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and an inlet port <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> which receives conduit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> to establish fluid connections between those conduits and die body <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. It is noted that inlet port <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> and conduit <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> by dotted lines to indicate that they are hidden in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. As can also be understood from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, body <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> includes a flow path <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> defined therethrough and which intersects a chamber <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> defined by body <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and a separator plate <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Separator plate <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is fixed at one end <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> thereof to body <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and has another end <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> spaced from end <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Chamber <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is defined by separator plate <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, wall <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, rear wall <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and front wall <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and extends from adjacent to end <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> of separator plate <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to adjacent to end <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> of separator plate <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. An outlet <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> of chamber <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is located adjacent to end <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> of the separator plate. Material I<highlight><subscript>C </subscript></highlight>flows from conduit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> into chamber <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> via flow path <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and from chamber <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> via outlet <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> as indicated by the arrow in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> As is also shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> flow path <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is defined in body <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> to extend from inlet <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> to a chamber <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> that surrounds chamber <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> adjacent to outlet <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. Because of this relative positioning of chambers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, any material I<highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>flowing in conduit <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> will surround material I<highlight><subscript>C </subscript></highlight>flowing from conduit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> through and from chamber <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The consistency of the materials is maintained so these materials will not mix together, but only abut each other and bond at the abutting surfaces when they are combined in die <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. While these materials are flowing in chambers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> they are flowing essentially side-by-side and in a common output direction toward outlet port <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> of die <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> As is also shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, material I<highlight><subscript>M </subscript></highlight>flowing from conduit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> flows through inlet port <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> into a chamber <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and flows in the output flow direction toward outlet port <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> as indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Chamber <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is defined by separator plate <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> wall <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and front wall <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. An outlet <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> is defined by front wall <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> and end <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> of separator plate <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Chamber <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> surrounds chamber <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> adjacent to outlet <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> whereby any material I<highlight><subscript>M </subscript></highlight>flowing from conduit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> through chamber <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and out outlet <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> will be surrounded by material flowing through chamber <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. As discussed above, the materials I<highlight><subscript>M </subscript></highlight>and I<highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>are formed so that they can flow in the side-by-side manner indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> in the output direction and can abut each other in layers without intermingling whereby layers are formed and retained as the mixture moves toward and through outlet port <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. The layering of the materials is indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> as layers L<highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>, L<highlight><subscript>C </subscript></highlight>and L<highlight><subscript>M</subscript></highlight>, with two layers L<highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>sandwiching layers L<highlight><subscript>C </subscript></highlight>and L<highlight><subscript>M</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> An exit conduit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> extends from outlets <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> of chambers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> respectively into outlet flow path <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> through die <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to ensure that materials I<highlight><subscript>M </subscript></highlight>and I<highlight><subscript>C </subscript></highlight>form distinct layers that are in abutting contact before layer I<highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>contacts such abutting layers. Further distances and heat addition are included in die <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to ensure that the multi-layer product shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> exiting outlet port <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> contains distinct layers. The length and internal dimensions of exit conduit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> are adjusted so the layers L<highlight><subscript>C </subscript></highlight>and L<highlight><subscript>M </subscript></highlight>bond together yet are sufficiently unfinished to accept layer L<highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>. In one form of the die, this distance is 0.50 inches, while the conduit is circular and has an internal diameter of 0.314 inches. The conduits and chambers are sized to produce pressures that achieve the goals of the process, such as a pressure of 400 to 500 psi in chamber <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. However, such pressures and temperatures can be adjusted to accommodate the final product. These state conditions can be monitored at the control console and adjusted as necessary according to feedback from an analysis of the final product being produced by the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Die <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> preferably is an extrusion die, so the final multi-layer product <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is a continuous stream of product. In some instances, it is desirable to have finite lengths of material. Accordingly, a cutter unit <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> is mounted on die <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> adjacent to outlet port <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Cutter unit <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> includes a knife blade <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> and is controlled by the control console for the system to cut predetermined lengths of multi-layer product flowing from outlet port <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. The materials forming the various layers can have different contraction rates during cooling whereby a rectangular element with co-extensive ends for the layers such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> will distort and assume an arcuate peripheral shape with layers L<highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>in some cases shrinking more than layers L<highlight><subscript>C </subscript></highlight>and L<highlight><subscript>M </subscript></highlight>which shrink about the same as each other whereby, layers L<highlight><subscript>C </subscript></highlight>and L<highlight><subscript>M </subscript></highlight>will extend out of layers L<highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>in the manner of a sandwich such as a cheeseburger. A product of this shape is indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> as product <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>&prime; with an overlap being indicated by portion L<highlight><subscript>M</subscript></highlight>&prime;. However, depending on the materials used in the layers, the distortion and shrinkage may vary or be the same for all layers. Those skilled in the food art will understand the factors and the effects of the various factors on the final product based on the teaching of this disclosure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> For the sake of completeness, a machine drawing of die <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, an insert element <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> is located in flow path <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and has properties that permit the heat transfer between the food layers to be adjusted to attain the goal of a plurality of distinct layers. As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, die <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can be assembled and disassembled according to the requirements of the final product. For example, a spacer block <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>S separates die portion <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>D from die final portion <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>F. By selecting the size of spacer block <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>S the distance between die portion <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>D and final portion <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>F can be adjusted. By adjusting this distance, the final cooking of the product can be controlled. Furthermore, by selecting the material for insert element <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> the cooking process can also be controlled. The material for insert element <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> is delron which contributes to the preparation of the final product. The thickness of the various layers can also be adjusted by adjusting the parts of die <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> as well. A bolt <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>B is used to hold the parts of die <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, the final product can contain a multiplicity of layers. While four layers have been disclosed above, more than four layers can be formed. To indicate this situation, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&prime; that has a plurality of units <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>. . . <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>N </subscript></highlight>and a plurality of additive units A<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>. . . A<highlight><subscript>N</subscript></highlight>. Material streams I<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>. . . I<highlight><subscript>N </subscript></highlight>flow into die <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>&Prime; such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, with the dots indicating further elements that are not specifically shown but which can be included. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, die <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>&Prime; includes a plurality of flow paths that are arranged so that one of the flow paths surrounds the others to sandwich the other flow paths therein in the manner discussed above for layer L<highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>. As discussed above, because the die is easily assembled and disassembled, the re-configuration of the die to accommodate further material flows is efficiently achieved. Thus, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> second separator plate <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is included in die <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>&Prime; and a conduit <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>N </subscript></highlight>from unit <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>N </subscript></highlight>fluidically connects unit <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>N </subscript></highlight>to die <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>&Prime; and to a chamber <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> that is similar to chamber <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Material I<highlight><subscript>N </subscript></highlight>flows into chamber <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> and then toward the outlet port <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>&prime; as discussed above in a side-by-side manner with material flowing in chamber <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>&prime; and chamber <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>&prime;. As discussed above in reference to die <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, these materials are combined in die <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>&Prime; to form layers L<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>. . . L<highlight><subscript>N </subscript></highlight>for product <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>&Prime;. A cutter unit <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> having a revolving cutter blade <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> can also be included in the die shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The overall process for forming the multi-layer product of the present invention is indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> for the preferred form of the multi-layer product and in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> for a multi-layer product having more than four layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Thus, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the overall process <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is shown as including steps of: providing a dry mix in step <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>; combining the dry mix with a liquid to form a slurry in step <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>; preparing, as by cooking, the slurry in step <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight>; adding a first additive to the prepared slurry to form a first ingredient in step <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight>; adding at least a second additive to the cooked slurry and forming a second ingredient in step <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>; adding a third additive to the dry mix to form a third ingredient in step <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>; preparing, as by cooking, the third ingredient in step <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight>; flowing the first ingredient and the third ingredient in side-by-side intersecting streams to form a first multi-layer product in step <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> and causing the first multi-layer product to flow in an output direction; and causing the second ingredient to flow in the output direction at two locations adjacent to the first direction; combining the flowing multi-layer product with the flowing second ingredient at the two locations to form a final multi-layer product in step <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight>. The final product can then be formed by cutting the material flowing out of the die and further treating that material as required for the end product. As indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>A, the process shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> can be modified to omit step <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> if unit <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is omitted so that some prepared ingredient flows directly from step <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> to step <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> This process is slightly modified in process <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>&prime; shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> to accommodate any number of materials included in the final multi-layer product. Thus, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the just-described process is repeated, but additional materials indicated by the dots and the unit I<highlight><subscript>N </subscript></highlight>are added to the mix in the forming die at step <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, with the outer layers being added from unit I<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>in step <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. Process <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>&prime; uses system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&prime; and die <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>&Prime; and produces product <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>&Prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> As was the case in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>A, some of the preparation units can be omitted with ingredients flowing directly from step <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> to step <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> without any processing performed on the ingredient between steps <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The preferred form of the multi-layer product as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is formed using the following ingredients: wheat red second clear, soy flour, soy bean meal 47.5% pro, salt, glycerol monosterate, potassium chloride, potassium sorbate, corn syrup, propylene glycol, smoke charsol C-10, phosphoric acid, beef tallow, emulsified beef, caramel and TiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and forms a product that is in the form of a cheeseburger and is suitable for animal treats. Real cheese can be used in the product if desired. The final product can include moisture that is sufficient to make the overall product contain 10%-11% moisture by weight for a dry product and 15% to 25% moisture by weight for a semi-moist product. It is also noted that the other ingredients that can be added in the alternative forms of the system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4, 5</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> include sesame seeds, egg-like products and the like. </paragraph>
