<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to a stabilizer apparatus for a work machine and more particularly to the ability to automatically pivot the stabilizer apparatus about a central pivot in conjunction with leveling a frame of the work machine. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> It is well known to provide work machines, such as excavators, backhoe loaders, telescopic material handlers, and the like, with a pair of stabilizer assemblies which engage the ground at lateral opposite sides of the work machine. The stabilizer assemblies are used to support the weight of the work machine and any loads being manipulated thereon so that a more stable and wider operating platform can be provided by the ground engaging wheels and the suspension system of the work machine. Such stabilizer assemblies are movable from a transport position to a ground engaging position to fix the stabilizer assemblies relative to the work machine in order to provide the wider operating platform. Often, however, ground conditions may be sloped or uneven requiring an operator to level the work machine in a well-known manner. When this occurs, the stabilizer assemblies may no longer contact the ground and will require position adjustment. Because each of the individual stabilizer assemblies are normally moved through independent control, it may be difficult to effectively locate the stabilizer assemblies on the ground in direct relation to the frame leveling that has occurred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Therefore, it is also well known to provide dependent movement of the stabilizer assemblies to adjust for leveling movement of the work machine. Typically, the work machine includes a frame, an axle for supporting the frame and a hydraulic cylinder connected between the frame and the axle. The hydraulic cylinder is actuated in the well known manner to level the work machine in relation to the ground by shifting or pivoting the axle relative to the frame via a pivot pin. In this type of arrangement, the pair of stabilizer assemblies are welded on the axle. Therefore, dependent movement of the stabilizer assemblies in correspondence with the axle is achieved via actuation of the hydraulic cylinder. However, the welding of the stabilizer assemblies to the axle may require complex axle rework when the stabilizer assemblies must be removed for maintenance or repair. Further, retrofitting existing work machines with such welded stabilizer assemblies would be difficult and time-consuming. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to overcome one or more of the problems as set forth above. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In one aspect of the present invention, a stabilizer apparatus is disclosed for a work machine. The work machine has a frame, an axle for supporting the frame and a hydraulic cylinder connected between the frame and the axle for shifting the axle relative to the frame to level the work machine. The stabilizer apparatus comprises a stabilizer assembly removably connectable to the axle of the work machine. A connection device is operable between the stabilizer assembly and the frame of the work machine to allow pivotal movement of the stabilizer assembly in response to the shifting movement of the axle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In another aspect of the invention, a method of automatically moving a stabilizer assembly on a work machine in conjunction with selectable shifting movement of an axle relative to a frame of the work machine is disclosed. The method comprises the steps of removably connecting the stabilizer assembly with the axle. Then, pivotally connecting the stabilizer assembly with the frame at a predetermined distance from the axle. Next, connecting a hydraulic cylinder between the frame and the axle. Then, moving the stabilizer assembly to a ground engaging position from a transport position. Finally, selectively shifting the axle relative to the frame via the hydraulic cylinder to level the frame of the work machine so that the position of the stabilizer assembly is automatically adjusted in response to the shifting of the axle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In yet another aspect of the invention, a method of automatically moving a stabilizer assembly on a work machine in conjunction with selectable shifting movement of an axle relative to a frame of the work machine is disclosed. The method comprises the steps of removably connecting the stabilizer assembly with the axle. Then, pivotally connecting the stabilizer assembly with the frame at a predetermined distance from the axle. Next, connecting a hydraulic cylinder between the frame and the axle. Then, selectively shifting the axle relative to the frame via the hydraulic cylinder to level the frame of the work machine so that the position of the stabilizer assembly is automatically adjusted in response to the shifting of the axle. Finally, moving the stabilizer assembly to a ground engaging position from a transport position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention stabilizer apparatus includes a stabilizer assembly removably connected with the axle and pivotally connected to the frame at a distance from the axle so that the stabilizer assembly may move automatically in response to shifting of the axle during leveling of the frame. The present invention is a simple and efficient means to achieve movement of the stabilizer assembly correspondent with the movement of the axle. Further, the present invention is designed to allow for addition of the stabilizer apparatus to an existing work machine (retrofitting) and for easily removing the stabilizer assembly from the work machine for maintenance or repair. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> While the invention is susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, a specific embodiment thereof has been shown by way of example in the drawings and will herein be described in detail. It should be understood, however, that there is no intent to limit the invention to the particular form disclosed, but on the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> A work machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, such as, a telescopic material handler, is partially shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and incorporates the features of the present stabilizer apparatus <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> thereon. The telescopic material handler <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is meant only to represent a wide variety of different machines that may incorporate the stabilizer apparatus, including, but not limited to, backhoe loaders, excavators and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The work machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a chassis or main frame <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> having a front end portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and a rear end portion (not shown). The work machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is equipped with large front and rear wheels, one of the front wheels being shown at <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, which are rotatably supported on a respective front axle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and a respective rear axle (not shown). The front axle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and the rear axle (not shown) are shiftably connected to the main frame <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in a well-known manner near the respective front end <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and rear end (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Referring more specifically to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the work machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also includes means for leveling the main frame <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. While various means for leveling can be used, in the illustrated arrangement, the means for leveling includes a double-acting, hydraulic leveling cylinder assembly <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> which is pivotally interconnected between the main frame <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the front axle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The leveling cylinder assembly <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> includes a leveling cylinder <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and a reciprocating rod <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> at least partially disposed within the leveling cylinder <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. The leveling cylinder assembly <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is supplied with hydraulic fluid from a fluid source (not shown). Fluid flow to and from the leveling cylinder assembly <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is preferably manually controllable by an operator (not shown), such as by a convention joystick controller (not shown). Thus, the operator (not shown) can selectively extend or retract the rod <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> to level the main frame <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to compensate for uneven terrain. It should be understood that although in the illustrated arrangement the leveling cylinder assembly <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is connected between the main frame <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the front axle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, in other arrangements, the leveling cylinder assembly <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> could be positioned in the rear of the work machine between the main frame <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the rear axle (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Referring again to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the stabilizer apparatus <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes a stabilizer assembly <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> with a substantially enclosed lower box assembly <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> operatively associated with the front axle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The lower box assembly <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> includes a body portion <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and a pair of spaced leg portions <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> extending from the body portion <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> a predetermined distance. The leg portions <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> are each removably connected, such as through a plurality of bolts <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>, to the front axle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. A pair of connector brackets <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, seen best in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, are connected in any suitable manner to an upper surface <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> of the body portion <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Each of the connector brackets <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> extend a predetermined distance from the upper surface <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> and include an opening therethrough. The connector brackets <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> are interconnected via a pin tube <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> extending through each of the openings to define a pin bore <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> A pair of stabilizer legs <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> are pivotally connected on opposite sides, respectively, of the lower box assembly <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> for movement between an upper transport position <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and a lower ground engaging position <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight>, as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The stabilizer legs <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> are movable through the actuation of a respective stabilizer cylinder assembly <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. The stabilizer cylinder assemblies <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> each include a stabilizer cylinder <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> and a reciprocating rod <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> at least partially disposed within the stabilizer cylinder <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>. The stabilizer cylinder assemblies <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> are supplied with hydraulic fluid from the fluid source (not shown). Fluid flow to and from the stabilizer cylinder assemblies <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> is preferably manually controllable by an operator (not shown), such as by a convention joystick controller (not shown) via a control device <highlight><bold>275</bold></highlight>, seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. It should be understood that the control device <highlight><bold>275</bold></highlight> is shown disconnected from the stabilizer cylinder assemblies <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> to provide visual clarity of the surrounding components. However, it should be understood that the control device <highlight><bold>275</bold></highlight> may be a control valve assembly or any other suitable means to provide independent control of fluid flow to the stabilizer cylinder assemblies <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> A connection device <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> is operable between the stabilizer assembly <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the main frame <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to allow pivotal movement of the stabilizer assembly <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> in response to shifting movement of the front axle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The connection device <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> includes a partially open upper box assembly <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> removably connected, such as through a plurality of bolts <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, with the main frame <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The upper box assembly <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> includes two pair of spaced and opposed side walls <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, seen best in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, and an upper cover (not shown) and an intermediate partition <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> that partially enclose the upper box assembly <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> and define an interior space <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> therein. A portion of the two pair of side walls <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and the intermediate partition <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> define an exterior space <highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight>, seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. An opening <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> is defined through one of the pair of side walls <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> to establish a clearance space for hoses (not shown) and the like for connection with the control device <highlight><bold>275</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The connection device <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> further includes a pin <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> with first and second end portions <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> connected to the upper box assembly <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> at a respective side wall <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, seen best in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The connector brackets <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> extend upwardly into the exterior space <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> so that the pin <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> extends through the pin bore <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to pivotally mount the stabilizer assembly <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> with the upper box assembly <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A method <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> of automatically moving the stabilizer assembly <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> in conjunction with the shifting movement of the front axle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is disclosed and described in more detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Industrial Applicability </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> When operating on uneven terrain, the operator (not shown) will independently move the stabilizer legs <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> via the stabilizer cylinders <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> to the ground engaging position <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight> from the transport position <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> to stabilize the work machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The operator (not shown) will then selectively shift the front axle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> relative to the main frame <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> via the leveling cylinder <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to level the main frame <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> with the ground. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Due to bolting the stabilizer assembly <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to the front axle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and pivotally connecting the stabilizer assembly <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> with the main frame <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> through the upper box assembly <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> and pin <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight>, the method <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> of automatically moving the stabilizer assembly <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> in conjunction with the shifting movement of the front axle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is accomplished. It should be understood that movement of the lower box assembly <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the stabilizer legs <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> are coincident in that the movement is simultaneous and dependent on the shifting movement of the front axle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to establish a substantially common angular relationship between the front axle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and the ground and the stabilizer assembly <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the ground. Therefore, independent movement of the stabilizer legs <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> to stabilize the work machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> after the ground engaging position is set is not needed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> It should be understood that the leveling of the main frame <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> with the ground may be performed prior to moving the stabilizer legs <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> to the ground engaging position. When this occurs, the stabilizer assembly <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> moves coincident with the shifting movement of the front axle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> so that the substantially common angular relationship is set prior to moving the stabilizer legs <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. However, in this arrangement, the ability to independently move the stabilizer legs <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> should be prevented once the leveling of the main frame <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> occurs so that the stabilizer legs <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> move dependently to maintain the substantially common angular relationship with the ground as the front axle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> throughout movement to the ground engaging position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The ability to dependently move the stabilizer legs <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> with the front axle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> virtually eliminates the need to independently move the stabilizer legs <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> to different ground engaging positions that correspond with the respective movement of the front axle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to level the main frame <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Further, the stabilizer apparatus <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is removable from the work machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by simply removing the bolts <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> connecting the lower box assembly <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> with the front axle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and the bolts <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> connecting the upper box assembly <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> with the main frame <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. This removability of the stabilizer apparatus <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> allows for its use as an optional feature before or after the sale of the work machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Further, the ability to remove the stabilizer apparatus <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> from the work machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> eases any necessary maintenance and repair of the stabilizer apparatus <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> without totally limiting the ability to operate the work machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
