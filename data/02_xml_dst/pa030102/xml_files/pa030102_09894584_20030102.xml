<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates generally to an inkjet printer; and more generally, to a method and system for reducing banding effects in such printers. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In designing a printer, it is important to provide as economically and simply as possible a relatively high output quality at a relatively high speed. The output quality of the printer is a function of its printhead resolution (i.e., the ability to resolve or separate, often visually, two image elements or details). The finer the resolution, the better the print quality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The resolution of the printhead of an inkjet printer is directly related to its nozzle pitch (i.e., distance between adjacent nozzles on the printhead). This distance is typically designed to be uniform. This generally translates into having a uniform dot pitch (i.e., distance between adjacent dots in a printout). One disadvantage of a uniform dot pitch is the inability to hide printing errors. For example, to print on a print medium, nozzles of the inkjet printer eject tiny droplets of ink, or dots, during each horizontal pass of the printhead over the print medium to form a row of dots. (Each horizontal pass of a printhead over a print medium is called a swath.) After each preceding swath, the print medium is incrementally advanced to allow room for the next row of dots. Through a succession of rows of dots, images or letters are printed on the print medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Each dot has a uniform diameter and is placed at a uniform distance from each other on the print medium and each preceding row of dots is placed at the same distance from the succeeding row of dots. Consequently, any two adjacent rows of dots are at the same distance from each other. Hence, there is a uniform band of white space between any two adjacent rows of dots. It should be noted that dot placement in present day inkjet printers is consistent enough that this uniform band of white space is maintained even in more than one pass print mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In any case, any small dot placement errors and dot shape variations that impinge on this band of white space create a hue or saturation shift. This hue or saturation shift is often referred to as banding since it exhibits itself as a visible band. This phenomenon is more discernible when printing graphic images. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> One way to address banding effects is to eliminate altogether print mechanism errors such as feed errors, nozzle to nozzle dot placement errors, shape variations and the like that foster dot placement errors and dot shape variations. To do so, however, requires the use of very sophisticated programming techniques and precisely engineering mechanical parts. This is an expensive endeavor which is often times reflected in the price of the printer thus built. Therefore, instead of attempting to eliminate these print mechanism errors, a less expensive method is to distribute these errors in such a way as to minimize their conspicuousness (i.e., to hide the errors). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> One method that has been used to distribute these errors is to increase the number of swath passes. That is, since sophisticated programming techniques and precisely engineering mechanical parts are not used, line feed errors, nozzle to nozzle dot placement errors, shape variations etc. do occur, albeit very minimally, at each swath pass. The higher the number of passes, therefore, the more prevalent these errors and; consequently, the less uniform the dot pitch (i.e., more and more of the dots appear to impinge on the band of white space). After a certain number of passes (this number is dependent on a particular style of printer), so much of the band of white space is impinged upon, that it ceases to exist. Banding is thus effectively eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> There are a few disadvantages associated with the above-described method. For example, as is obvious, the higher the number of swath passes that are used in printing a page, the slower the printer. Furthermore, the placement of the dots in the band of white space is unpredictable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it would be beneficial to develop a method that distributes mechanical printing errors in a known and predictable fashion over the band of white space without affecting printer speed and cost. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In the following description of the invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration a specific example in which the invention may be practiced. Other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> I. General Overview: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The present invention reduces print quality and image quality sensitivity to dot placement errors and dot shape variations in an inkjet printer by deliberately introducing low spatial frequency dot placement variations, heretofore referred to as red noise, across the printhead of the system. The red noise is introduced by sinusoidally varying the dot pitch of the printer. The sinusoidal introduction of red noise across the printhead has the effect of distributing dots in the print medium axis (i.e., axis of print medium advance) and thus fills in the band of white space between dot rows. This makes the system more robust to dot placement and shape variations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> II. Detailed Operation of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> With reference now to the figures, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> depicts a block diagram of an inkjet printer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> connected to a workstation <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. This invention may also be implemented in other types of printers, such as thermal printers, bubble jet printers etc. Further, although the invention is described in the context of printers, it may also be used in conjunction with other image reproduction systems such as copiers, scanners and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As is well known in the field, the workstation <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> has at least one processor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> to process data, including printing data. The workstation <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> also has a system memory <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> (e.g., RAM) that holds data that is to be immediately used by the processor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and a storage system <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> (e.g., ROM, hard disk, floppy disk, CD-ROM etc.) to store application programs. One such application program is a printer driver that is used to control the printer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The printer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> itself has a processor <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, a volatile memory <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> (e.g., RAM) and a non-volatile memory <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> (e.g., ROM, flash etc.). The processor <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> is used to control all moving mechanical parts of the printers. Just as in the case of the workstation <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, the volatile memory <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> is used to hold data for the immediate use of the processor <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. The non-volatile memory <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> is used to store, among other programs, the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> However, before delving into the present invention, a brief description of an inkjet printer is needed. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a perspective view of the inkjet printer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The printer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> has an input tray <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> containing sheets of print medium which pass through a printing zone and along a print medium advance direction <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, past an exit <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> into an output tray <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>. Electronics control <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> for commanding the processor <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> to perform various functions are included. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> A movable carriage <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> holds print cartridges <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> which respectively hold yellow (Y), magenta (M), cyan (C) and black (B) inks and dispense these inks upon command from the processor <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. The back of the carriage <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> has multiple bushings (not shown) which ride along a slide rod <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight>, enabling bidirectional movement of the carriage along the rod <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The carriage <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> thus moves along a carriage scanning direction <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, above a sheet of print medium upon which an image is being formed by print cartridges <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The position of the carriage <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight>, as it traverses the print medium back and forth, is determined by an encoder strip <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight>. This very accurate positioning device enables selective firing of the various ink nozzles on each print cartridge at the appropriate times during each carriage scan to form the image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> With each scan or swath pass of the carriage <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight>, the print medium is advanced incrementally in the direction <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> along the print medium axis. These incremental advances allow for the distribution of dots in the band of white space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> depicts a thermal inkjet printhead <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and a printhead controller <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>. The printhead <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of nozzles <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> and is part of an inkjet pen (not shown) used for printing ink onto a media sheet. Although two columns of nozzles are displayed, more columns of nozzles may be used. Along with the nozzles, a temperature sensor <highlight><bold>428</bold></highlight> is shown. The temperature sensor is used to measure the temperature of the printhead <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. The printhead controller <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> is connected to printhead <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and monitors the temperature sensor <highlight><bold>428</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates one of a plurality of nozzles used in the present invention. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, each nozzle includes a nozzle chamber <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight> for holding ink <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight> and a heating resistor <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight>. In operation, the heating resistor <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight> receives a firing pulse from drive transistor <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> causing the heating resistor <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight> to heat up the ink <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight> in the chamber <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight> to ejection temperature in order to eject the ink through orifice <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight>. For each nozzle, there is a corresponding nozzle chamber <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight>, heating resistor <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight>, drive transistor <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> and heating transistor <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight>. Although two transistors are used (one to pre-heat and one to drive resistor <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight>), the use of one transistor is perfectly within the scope of the present invention. In that case, the one transistor can fire less pulse current to pre-heat resistor <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight> and more pulse current to drive resistor <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a schematic diagram of the nozzle circuitry associated with a given nozzle <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>. The heating resistor <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight> is coupled to a nozzle voltage source <highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight> at one contact point and to the drains of the drive transistor <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> and warming transistor <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight> at another contact point. The drive transistor <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> is formed by one or more power field effect transistor (FET) devices <highlight><bold>642</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment illustrated six FETs <highlight><bold>642</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>642</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>formed the drive transistor <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>. The warming transistor <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight> is formed by a smaller FET device <highlight><bold>644</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The drains of the FET devices <highlight><bold>642</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>644</bold></highlight> are coupled in common to the heating resistor <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight> via an interconnect <highlight><bold>643</bold></highlight>. The sources of the devices <highlight><bold>642</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>644</bold></highlight> are coupled in common to ground <highlight><bold>646</bold></highlight>. The gates M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-M<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the FET devices <highlight><bold>642</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>642</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>are coupled to a power control circuit <highlight><bold>648</bold></highlight>, which receives the firing control signal <highlight><bold>532</bold></highlight>. The gate M<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the warming transistor device <highlight><bold>644</bold></highlight> is coupled to the printhead controller <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> for receiving the warming control signal <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a schematic diagram of the power control circuit <highlight><bold>648</bold></highlight>. The power control circuit <highlight><bold>648</bold></highlight> is formed by a set of current booster circuits. A firing control signal is received from the printhead controller <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>. The signal is boosted to generate a signal <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight> input to the gates M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-M<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the drive transistor devices <highlight><bold>642</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated embodiment, the power control circuit includes eight FET devices <highlight><bold>752</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>766</bold></highlight> and an inverter <highlight><bold>768</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The firing control signal <highlight><bold>532</bold></highlight> is active when a logic low is received at the power control circuit <highlight><bold>648</bold></highlight>. The logic low is inverted at inverter <highlight><bold>768</bold></highlight> resulting in a logic high signal <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight> output from the power control circuit <highlight><bold>648</bold></highlight> into the gates M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-M<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the drive transistor devices <highlight><bold>642</bold></highlight>. Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the gates M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-M<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> allow current flow through the devices <highlight><bold>642</bold></highlight>. Specifically, current flows from the nozzle voltage source <highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight> through the heating resistor <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight> into the drains <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>to ground <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. When an inactive signal (e.g., a logic high) is received at power control circuit <highlight><bold>648</bold></highlight>, signal <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight> is a logic low. Thus, the junction from drain to source at drive transistor devices <highlight><bold>642</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>642</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>is closed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> When an active signal level is received at the warming transistor device <highlight><bold>644</bold></highlight>, gate M<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> enables current flow through the device <highlight><bold>644</bold></highlight>. Specifically, current floes from the nozzle voltage source <highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight> through the heating resistor <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight> into the drain <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and out through the source <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> of the warming transistor <highlight><bold>644</bold></highlight> to ground <highlight><bold>646</bold></highlight>. When an inactive signal level is received at the gate M<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the warming transistor device <highlight><bold>644</bold></highlight>, the junction from drain <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> to source <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is closed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The warming control signal <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> and the firing control signal <highlight><bold>532</bold></highlight> are separate signals having separate signal paths. To generate a warming pulse, the firing control signal <highlight><bold>532</bold></highlight> is inactive and the warming control signal is active. Thus, a small current flows from the nozzle voltage source <highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight> through the heating resistor <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight> into the drain <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and out the source <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> of the warming transistor <highlight><bold>644</bold></highlight> to ground <highlight><bold>646</bold></highlight>. The current flowing through the heating resistor <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight> is based upon the size of the transistor device <highlight><bold>644</bold></highlight>. Such current is insufficient to cause the nozzle <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> to fire. Warming transistor device <highlight><bold>644</bold></highlight> is used as a switching device turning the current flow through the device <highlight><bold>644</bold></highlight> on or off. The current magnitude for a warming pulse may be between 2.0 and 3.5 mA; and the nozzle voltage around 21 volts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> To generate a firing pulse, the warming control signal <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> is inactive and the firing control signal is active. Thus, current flows from the nozzle voltage source <highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight> through the heating resistor <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight> into the drains <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>and out of the source <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>to ground <highlight><bold>646</bold></highlight>. The current flowing through the heating resistor <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight> is based upon the number and size of the transistor devices <highlight><bold>642</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>642</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>. Such current is enough to cause a nozzle <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> to fire. The current magnitude for a firing pulse may be around 300 mA and the nozzle voltage source around 21 volts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Obviously, other voltage and current levels may be used in alternative embodiments. Furthermore, to fire a nozzle <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> both a firing signal <highlight><bold>532</bold></highlight> and a warming signal <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> may be active so that current flows from the nozzle voltage source <highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight> through the heating resistor <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight> and through all the devices <highlight><bold>642</bold></highlight> and device <highlight><bold>644</bold></highlight> to ground <highlight><bold>646</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> When both the firing control signal <highlight><bold>532</bold></highlight> and the warming control signal <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> are inactive, current does not flow through the devices <highlight><bold>642</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>644</bold></highlight>. Consequently, current does not flow through the heating resistor <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, the invention includes sinusoidally varying the dot pitch of the inkjet printer. This sinusoidal variation of the dot pitch introduces a low frequency of dot placement variations. The sinusoidal introduction of the red noise is achieved by altering the location of each ink drop on the media from each nozzle. This can be accomplished, for example, by a constant nozzle pitch and varying trajectory, with constant trajectory and varying nozzle pitch or some combination thereof. Ink drops from one nozzle can be retarded (i.e., trajectory is altered such that the ink drop falls on the print media at a location lower than where they would have normally fallen on the print media) or advanced (i.e., trajectory is altered such that the ink drop falls on the print media at a location higher than where they would have normally fallen on the print media). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> There are many ways of altering the trajectory of the ink drops. For example, the nozzle pitch itself may be altered (e.g., each nozzle may be placed at a non-uniform location to ensure that ink droplets from the nozzle are placed at the desired location on the print media). The alteration of the trajectory may be further accomplished by systematically varying bore concentricity, resistor orifice misalignment (i.e., distance between resistor and nozzle orifice), counterbore misalignment (e.g., locating each nozzle not concentric with the bore exit) etc., or by any combination thereof. In the present invention, the trajectory of the ink drops is altered by using a non-uniform nozzle pitch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the term concentricity as used above refers to a geometrically relative location of the centroids of the entrance and the exit of the bore. Also, the term counterbore misalignment as used above refers to locating the counterbore (usually a circular feature) such that it is not concentric with the bore exit. The counterbore misalignment does not relate to the depth of the counterbore. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, a 3 um amplitude sine wave is superimposed over a uniform dot pitch of 42 um. A 42 um dot pitch translates into a 600 dots per inch (dpi) pitch. The period of the sine wave is chosen to be 256 to match the number of nozzles used in the print mode of interest. However, the period need not match the number of nozzles. When the period of deviation is matched with the number of nozzles used, each dot row is printed using nozzles with a variety of deviations from the average dot pitch. This ensures uniformity of tone and maximizes the benefit of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> As the deviation from the average dot pitch varies continuously, the distance between adjacent nozzles varies only slightly across the printhead. This is highly desirable since it will not create defects in print modes that use only a small number of passes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> III. Advantages of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The advantages of the present invention are many. First, it introduces visual noise into an image in a known and predictable fashion, allowing for the signature of that noise to be engineered along with the printing system. Second, the invention does not require additional passes to eliminate banding effects. For example, it has been shown that relying on line feed errors, nozzle to nozzle dot placement errors, shape variations etc. requires a twelve-pass print mode to achieve an equivalent white space saturation of the eight-pass print mode of the present invention. Hence, the present invention, in some instances, enhances the speed of printers that have decreased or eliminated banding effects. Third, since the use of the invention covers the white space creating the banding sensitivity without increasing dot size, grain is not increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> IV. Conclusion </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The description of the present invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description, but is not intended to be exhaustive or limited to the invention in the form disclosed.
