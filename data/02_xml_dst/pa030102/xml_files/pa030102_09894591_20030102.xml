<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">An apparatus is provided to automatically cover and uncover crucibles according to a predetermined procedure in a proximate analyzer. A series of crucibles mounted in a first carousel is heated in a furnace. A second carousel mounted above the first carousel holds crucible covers. A mechanism synchronizes the movements of the carousels so that the heated crucibles are automatically covered and uncovered at the appropriate times during the analysis with a corresponding cover by lowering or raising the second carousel. The movements of both carousels are automatically controlled so that at appropriate points in the testing cycle they rotate simultaneously about a common central axis and a crucible is deposited on a weighing platform by controlling the vertical motion of the entire carousel apparatus. The crucible is weighed either with or without a crucible cover depending on the stage of the analysis without the need of manual intervention. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to the automation of proximate analyzers and the like, and more particularly, to apparatus and a method for opening and closing crucibles during such analysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Systems for proximate analysis of fossil fuels such as coal and coke through the use of heat are well known. The samples are subject to a heating and cooling cycle in a furnace chamber. The samples are in crucibles. The crucibles are in turn seated on a platter or carousel positioned within the chamber. At various times during the cycle the crucibles are covered or uncovered through the placing or removal of crucible covers. A weighing platform is positioned within the furnace chamber. The carousel continuously deposits the crucibles in a predetermined sequence on the weighing platform and the weights of the crucibles monitored to calculate the contained volatiles based on weight loss during heating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,522,788, to Sitek et al., issued on Jun. 11, 1985, is directed to such a system. In this patent, the crucibles are placed manually on a carousel and covered and uncovered manually during the analysis. The crucibles are uncovered for initial weighing and then heated in nitrogen atmosphere to remove moisture content from the samples in them, the covers are then remounted by hand and the crucibles are heated to a higher temperature also in a nitrogen atmosphere to obtain volatiles, cooled, removed by hand in the presence of nitrogen atmosphere and heated again in oxygen atmosphere to obtain ash. In order to make such analyses more efficient and safer there is a need for a proximate analysis system that can automatically cover and uncover a series of crucibles at the appropriate stages of the analysis without requiring manual intervention. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The present invention meets the foregoing needs by use of a second upper carousel sharing a common axis with the original lower carousel. The crucibles are mounted in openings on the lower carousel and the crucible covers are mounted in openings on the upper carousel. The lower carousel is used solely for the manipulation of the crucibles and the upper carousel for the manipulation of the crucible covers. The carousels both rotate and move up and down along their central axis. The movements of both carousels are coupled so as to simultaneously move around their central axis but move independently along their common vertical axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> At appropriate points in the testing cycle, individual crucible are automatically deposited on a weighing platform through vertical motion of the entire dual carousel apparatus. The presence or absence of a crucible cover during weighing is determined by the vertical motion along the common axis of the upper carousel. Two pneumatic cylinders control the vertical movement of the carousels. The first pneumatic cylinder acts to raise and lower the dual carousel mechanism so that a crucible is deposited on the weighing platform and a second pneumatic cylinder act to raise and lower the upper carousel in relation to the lower carousel. When the vertical movement of the upper carousel is such as to bring the upper and lower carousel together, the crucible covers rest on, and seals the crucibles, during heating, or weighing. When the upper carousels are separated, the crucible is uncovered and open to the atmosphere during heating and weighing. Thus, in the cycle, the carousels will automatically act to remove the covers during heating to remove moisture, remount the covers to obtain volatiles and remove the covers to obtain ash.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a schematic partial cut away view of a prior art proximate detector <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> showing the interior of the furnace chamber. As can be seen in the drawing, there is one carousel <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> which is capable of holding multiple crucibles. The carousel is capable of moving up and down to positions <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>B to heat a crucible and place a crucible on a weigh platform <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> for weighing. At different stages in the heating process, it may be necessary to place a cover on certain crucibles. According to the prior art scheme, such placement of covers is performed manually on each crucible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> shows improved proximate analyzer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of the present invention in the same view as prior art analyzer shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The present invention differs in that there are two carousels in the furnace chamber <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. Upper carousel <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> carries and transports crucible covers exemplified by crucible cover <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> while lower carousel <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> carries and transports crucibles exemplified by crucible <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. When carousel <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and carousel <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> are brought together a cover <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is placed on a crucible <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference> shows the position of carousels <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> at a point in the analytical cycle where a crucible <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is weighed uncovered. Lower carousel <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is in its lowered position allowing a crucible <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> to be placed on the balance platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> while crucible cover <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is retained above and separated from a crucible <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> by upper carousel <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> during weighing on a balance <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</cross-reference> shows both the lower carousel <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and upper carousel <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> lowered allowing a crucible <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> to have a cover <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> on it while being weighed on the balance <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The detailed mechanism of the present invention may be understood by reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> which is a tilted front perspective top view, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> which is a tilted back perspective top view of the present invention with both the upper carousel <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and lower carousel <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> in the closed position and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> which is a view of the dual carousel system without a support structure tilted on its side to show its components. The furnace chamber which forms a part of the proximate analyzer is not shown in these drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The mechanism is supported by a base <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> which, in the present embodiment, is comprised of two beams <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>that hold the system components including balance <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. Arm <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> attached to base <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> and supported by a brace <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> is connected to component <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of a slide joint <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight>, and component <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of slide joint <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> is connected to body <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> which supports the dual carousel mechanism and which moves up and down along slide joint <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight>, better seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, to place crucibles <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> on balance platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> connected to balance <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> by means of shaft <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>. The space between the two beams of base <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> allows room for the upper carousel pneumatic cylinder <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> to move up and down between the beams when both the carousels are lowered onto the balance platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The body <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> is connected to an elevation block <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The connection between the elevation block <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> and the main support arm <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is accomplished through a slide joint <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> which allows the dual carousel system to move up and down along the main support arm <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. The combination of body <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> which is connected to elevation block <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> which is in turn connected to elevation shaft <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> projecting from pneumatic cylinder <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> supports the weight of the entire dual carousel mechanism. Pneumatic elevation cylinder <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> mounted on base beam <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>raises and lowers the entire dual carousel mechanism. Although pneumatic means are preferred, any other means known in the art to raise or lower a structure such as worm gears or pulley arrangements may be used to control the vertical movement of the entire dual carousel mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The carousels themselves can be made from any rigid material that can withstand elevated temperatures without substantial deterioration or distortion, preferably metallic sheet materials such as stainless steels, and any other such materials used in the art. As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> upper carousel <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> has openings <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight> to accommodate crucible covers <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and lower carousel <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> has openings <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> to accommodate crucibles <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> As seen most clearly in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5 a</cross-reference> retainer <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> is connected to shaft <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> which fixes the position of hollow shaft <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> between two bearings (not shown) one on each side within body <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> so that when moving upper carousel shaft <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> up for removal of crucible covers shaft <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> will not be shifted or dragged up relative to body <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> around the upper carousel shaft <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>. In addition, in the present embodiment, a screw <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight> protrudes from retainer <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> that serves to activate a magnetic sensor producing a signal indicating the horizontal rotational position of the carousels thereby enabling the position of each crucible to be tracked by a computer program that monitors the analysis and calculates weight loss at each stage. As will be apparent to those skilled in the art, other means of tracking the position of the carousels may be used such as reflective tape affixed to shaft <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> which in conjunction with a light source sends a signal to an appropriate sensor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> As most clearly seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the lower carousel <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is attached to a hollow shaft <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> by means of small disk <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> which is attached to the bottom of lower carousel <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> by attaching means known in the art such as riveting welding and the like. Hollow shaft <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> is connected to a gear <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> at the end distal to small disk <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>. An opening (not shown) at the center of small disk <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> and lower carousel <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> allows passage of shaft <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> which is connected to upper carousel <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. The lower carousel <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is turned using a step motor <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> which has a pulley <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> connected to the drive shaft of step motor <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>. The pulley <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> is connected to the gear <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> with a belt <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. The step motor <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> is connected to the main body <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> using a motor support <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> most clearly seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. While the step motor <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> directly controls the rotation of the lower carousel <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, there is no motor which independently turns the upper carousel <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. Any other suitable means known in the art may be used to drive the rotation of lower carousel <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. Movement of upper carousel <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is achieved via a synchronization pin <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> which is screwed into the upper face of lower carousel <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and protrudes through the upper face of upper carousel <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> via keyhole <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> thereby synchronizing the rotation of the carousels. Synchronization pin <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> is sufficiently long so that it remains within keyhole <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> when upper carousel <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is raised during normal operation of the analyzer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Upper carousel <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is connected to a solid shaft <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> which then passes through the hollow shaft <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> of the lower carousel <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and is then connected to the piston shaft (unseen) from upper carousel pneumatic cylinder <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> via a rotational coupling <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> to accommodate the rotational motion imparted by gear <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>. The connection of the upper carousel <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> to the end of shaft <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> distal from pneumatic cylinder <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is made by using a central screw <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> although other fastening means known in the art may be used. As is known in the art, a screw connects the rotational coupling <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> and the piston shaft of pneumatic cylinder <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> to allow the rotational coupling <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> to rotate freely while the screw is fixed to the pneumatic cylinder <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. The shaft <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> for upper carousel <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is fixed to the rotational coupling <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> thereby allowing carousel <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> to rotate while being raised or lowered by pneumatic cylinder <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. Pneumatic cylinder <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is connected to the main body <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> using support columns <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The vertical movement of upper carousel <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is controlled by pneumatic cylinder <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> via carousel shaft <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The carousels of the present invention are designed to operate within a furnace as schematically depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A, 2B</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>C. When the mechanism is operated with the covers off or in an open position, the processes that occur to raise carrousel <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> are as follows: the piston of pneumatic cylinder <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> pushes rotational coupling <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> up, pushing shaft <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> up through hollow shaft <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>. This, in turn, pushes upper carousel <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> up, thereby separating it from lower carousel <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and carrying crucible covers <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> away from crucibles <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. When pneumatic cylinder <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> lowers the dual carrousel mechanism so that crucible <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> touches balance platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. The distance between the carousels is adjusted so that it is great enough to keep crucible <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> out of contact with either the upper carousel <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> or crucible cover <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> When the mechanism is operated with the covers on or in a closed position, the processes that occur to lower carrousel <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> are as follows: the piston of pneumatic cylinder <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> pulls rotational coupling <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> down pulling shaft <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> down through hollow shaft <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> and pulls upper carousel <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, to which shaft <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> is connected, down to bring it together with lower carousel <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> so that covers <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> on carousel <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> are placed on crucibles <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> on carousel <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. When pneumatic elevation cylinder <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> goes down, crucible <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, covered with cover <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> will be deposited on balance platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The advantages of the improvement of the present invention may be understood by comparison with the prior art. A proximate analysis including a cycle for moisture, volatiles and ash using the prior art analyzer of U. S. Pat. No. 4,522,788 requires the following steps: obtaining the tare weight of the crucibles, introducing sample to all crucibles, reweighing to obtain sample weight, heating the furnace, reweighing to obtain moisture content, opening the furnace door and manually covering the crucibles, closing the furnace and ramping the temperature higher to obtain volatiles, cooling the furnace down, opening the furnace door half way (to avoid too much heat loss) to allow manual removal of the crucible covers with tools in order to go to the ash cycle. Removal of the covers is necessary in order to burn the coal and then determine the weight of residual ash. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Normally the interior of the furnace is flushed with nitrogen during the moisture and volatiles cycles to avoid oxidation, while the ash cycle is conducted in an oxygen atmosphere to facilitate oxidation of the sample remaining in the crucible after the previous cycles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In the system of the present invention, after the tare weight of the crucibles have been obtained and the samples introduced and their weight obtained, with the upper and lower carousels in the closed position, the operator places the crucible covers on top of the crucibles, thereby covering the crucibles, and the weight of the covers is obtained by reweighing and the cycle starts by raising the covers automatically and increasing the temperature. The crucibles are reweighed to obtain moisture and the covers are automatically placed on top of the crucibles for volatile analysis and the furnace temperature is again increased and the crucibles are weighed with covers on to obtain volatiles. The covers are then removed automatically to start the ash analysis cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The system of the present invention provides the following advantages over the prior art: safety, no danger of an operator being burned due to manual handling of crucible covers at high temperatures; the convenience of unattended operation; and better reproducibility of the analytical results mostly volatiles because the furnace door never opens during analysis, therefore no air gets inside the furnace that may affect volatile results by oxidation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The system of the present invention may be applied to any process where the automated covering and uncovering of a series of containers is necessary or useful. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> It is understood that the present embodiments described above are to be considered as illustrative and not restrictive. It will be obvious to those skilled in the art to make various changes, alterations and modifications to the invention described herein. To the extent that these variations, modifications and alterations depart from the scope and spirit of the appended claims, they are intended to be encompassed therein. </paragraph>
