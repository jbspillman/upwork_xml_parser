<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to taking orders for goods and services over telephone or a computer network, and in particular, for taking such orders automatically while building a relationship data base. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,915,246 (Patterson et al.) shows an ATM type service &ldquo;which operates in a predictive manner, in that when a user enters their card, the machine identifies the user, predicts the transaction most likely to be requested by that user, and presents one or more relevant messages, such as &lsquo;Do you require &pound;20&quest;&rsquo; or &lsquo;Do you require a mini statement&quest;&rsquo;, in accordance with that user&apos;s habitual transaction request or requests.&rdquo; It is a fully automated system for a customer who is present at the machine, with only customer intervention, and it is designed to work only with existing customers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Both U.S. Pat. No. 5,737,726 (Cameron et al.) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,832,451 (Flake et al.) show systems where the customer communicates directly with an agent. The computer system retains customer preferences and other information, but it works through a human agent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The Internet has numerous web sites with automatic ordering, but such sites for ordering books or music are not adapted for repeat orders of the same or similar products and do not allow for product specification, such as is common in ordering pizza, where a customer will specify size, toppings and crust type. In addition, the systems to do appear to be equally adaptable for network or telephone access. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In a preferred arrangement, the present invention, a relationship building method for automated services includes the steps of receiving a contact from a client such as by telephone or over the Internet or other computer network, looking for the client in a client data base, and if the client is in the client data base, then welcoming the client by name. If the client is calling by telephone and does not like auto attendant, then the client is transferred to a customer service representative. If the goods are delivered or the services are rendered from many different locations, then the client is transferred to a customer representative located near the client. Otherwise, the client is presented with an option of one or more services or goods that are usual for the client as determined by the client data base. If the client selects one of the usual services or goods, then the client request is processed, but if the client does not select one of the usual services or goods, then the client is presented with a list of services or goods from which to select, the new request is entered into the client data base, and the client request is processed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> If, however, the client is not in the client data base, then the client is welcomed and asked for billing and delivery information. The client billing and delivery information is then entered into the client data base. The client is then presented with a list of services or goods from which to select and the new request is also entered into the client data base, and the client request is processed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In another preferred arrangement of a relationship building method for automated services according to the present invention, processing the client request further includes the steps of, if the client is in the client data base, presenting the client with an option of one or more methods for delivery of services or goods that are usual for the client as determined by the client data base, and if the client selects one of the usual methods of delivery, then further processing the client request. If the client does not select one of the usual methods of delivery, then the client is presented with a list of delivery methods from which to select, entering the new method into the client data base and the client request is further processed. If, on the other hand, the client is not in the client data base, then the client is presented with a list of delivery methods from which to select and the new method selected by the client is entered into the client data base, and the client request is further processed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In yet another arrangement of a relationship building method for automated services according to the present invention in which the services are rendered or the goods are distributed from a plurality of locations, further processing the client request includes creating a plurality of web pages on a computer network, corresponding to the plurality of locations, and posting the client information and the client request information on a web page of the plurality of web pages corresponding to a location which is close to the client. In a preferred form, presenting the client with a list of services or goods from which to select includes the step of presenting a series of options regarding services or goods. For contact by telephone call from the client, the relationship building method further includes using telephone caller identification, and looking for the client in a client data base includes determining what client or clients normally call from the identified telephone number. One preferred form of the relationship building method further includes communicating with the client is by means of interactive voice response. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> If, after initial contact be telephone, the client is in the client data base and dials a predetermined speed dial number corresponding to predetermined services or goods, then an order is processed that corresponds to the speed dial number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> These and other objects, advantages and features of this invention will be apparent from the following description taken with reference to the accompanying drawing, wherein is shown a preferred embodiment of the invention.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the drawing, and in particular to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, in a preferred arrangement of the present invention, a relationship building method for automated services includes the steps of receiving a contact <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> from a client such as by telephone or over the Internet or other computer network and looking <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for the client in a client data base. Client is used here to include what is typically termed a &ldquo;customer,&rdquo; and includes the potential purchaser of both goods and services. If the client is calling by telephone and does not like auto attendant, then the client is transferred <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to a customer service representative. If the goods are delivered or the services are rendered from many different locations, then the client is transferred to a customer representative located near the client. If the client is in the client data base, then the client is welcomed <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, in a preferred form, by name. Referring also to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the client is presented <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with an option of one or more services or goods that are usual for the client as determined by the client data base. If the client selects one of the usual services or goods, then the client request is processed, but if the client does not select one of the usual services or goods, then the client is presented <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> with a list of services or goods from which to select, the new request is entered into the client data base, as described further on, and the client request is processed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> If, however, the client is not in the client data base, then the client is welcomed <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and asked <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> for billing and delivery information. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the client billing and delivery information is then entered into the client data base, in the embodiment illustrated: name <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, confirmation of name <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, zip code <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, confirmation of zip code <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, live in an apartment <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, apartment number <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, confirmation of apartment number <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, number of other telephone numbers <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, next number <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, confirmation of next number <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, pay by credit card <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, type of credit card <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, credit card number <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, expiration date <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and confirmation of credit card number and expiration date <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The client is then presented <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> with a list of services or goods from which to select and the new request is also entered into the client data base, in the embodiment illustrated, number of pizzas <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, type of pizza <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, type of crust <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, what size pizza <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, confirmation of size, type (topping) and crust <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, and make usual order <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, and the client request is processed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Referring also to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, in another preferred arrangement of a relationship building method for automated services according to the present invention, processing the client request further includes the steps of, if the client is in the client data base, presenting the client with an option of one or more methods for delivery of services or goods, which might be those that are usual for the client as determined by the client data base, and if the client selects one of the usual methods of delivery, then further processing the client request. If the client does not select one of the usual methods of delivery, then the client is presented <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> with a list of delivery methods from which to select, entering the new method into the client data base and the client request is further processed. If, on the other hand, the client is not in the client data base, then the client is presented <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> with a list of delivery methods from which to select and the new method selected by the client is entered into the client data base, and the client request is further processed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In yet another arrangement of a relationship building method for automated services according to the present invention in which the services are rendered or the goods are distributed from a plurality of locations, further processing the client request includes creating <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> a plurality of web pages on a computer network, corresponding to the plurality of locations, and posting the client information and the client request information on a web page of the plurality of web pages corresponding to a location which is close to the client. In a preferred form, presenting the client with a list of services or goods from which to select includes the step of presenting a series of options regarding services or goods. For contact by telephone call from the client, the relationship building method further includes using telephone caller identification, and looking for the client in a client data base includes determining <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> what client or clients normally call from the identified telephone number. One preferred form of the relationship building method further includes communicating with the client is by means of interactive voice response (IVR). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, if, after initial contact be telephone, the client is in the client data base and dials <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> a predetermined speed dial number corresponding to predetermined services or goods, then an order is processed that corresponds to the speed dial number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The essence of the systemic relationship building model/engine is that on each contact the system expands its knowledge about the habits and likes of the company&apos;s clients, and re-enforces the corporate knowledge by repeating it or offering it to the client on subsequent contacts and thereby reaffirm the relationship. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> For example, a spouse knows their mate&apos;s menu likes and dislikes as a matter of repetition and memory. Likewise, an existing customer calls in and a customer service representative or an operator asks them to pronounce their full name. The full name is recorded in their pronunciation and on all future calls, the name is whisper announced to the operator so that the operator knows the exact pronunciation from the clients own mouth. If a customer makes a variation on their standard order&mdash;that variation is held in the data base and presented to the operator along with the primary preference on future client call ins. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Method of Telephone Processing on a Regional or National Number </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Currently the customer has the burden of finding the correct store and number. Under the systemic relationship system the customer&apos;s caller ID (ANI) would be captured and added to their preference profile. After the ANI preference profile is built, then by using a nation/regional wide number (800 or otherwise) the call will be automatically routed to the correct service location, often times before the customer hears the first ring on the telephone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Current processing systems are incapable of advertising a national 800 number and processing the orders to the appropriate store. As a result, sale poaching is a problem in the current ordering systems, and would be eliminated with the relationship building system of this invention. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Method of Order Taking </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> A key aspect of a great relationship is the ability to get it right the first time, which is actually a derivative of knowing their preferences and double checking. The systemic relationship model will achieve this by recording the order and using a dual entry quality control&mdash;when a call is received that flows into a live order processing operator the call would be recorded and reentered by a second operator. If a discrepancy is noted it would trigger a call back to ask for clarification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The delivery address is confirmed via ANI look up from the client history data base, and subsequent customer input and if needed modified by a customer service representative interview with the client. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Also, based upon previous orders the system will learn the customer&apos;s preferred payment method (Cash or credit card). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Further, based upon the history of regular orders the preferred customer ANI would be identified and routed for preferred handling versus the current first come first served and being abruptly placed on hold&mdash;creating a less than favorable ordering experience&mdash;and no records of kept of the abandoned sales lost as a result of this process. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Method of Order Delivery </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> There are three keys: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Announcement telephone call <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> of next to be delivered </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> A unique horn honk <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> or other audible announcing the arrival </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Confirmation <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of the correct order being delivered </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> To enhance a relationship, a customer is provided a pre-delivery announcement telephone call. After each delivery the driver will notify the center of a correct delivery. That notification will in turn trigger an announcement call (could be enhanced by a 2 way paging system or cellular internet connection where the driver logs each delivery as completed back to the center&mdash;also enhances safety by regularly identifying the driver&apos;s location) the center would make a computer generated call to announce to the next customer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The call would announce to the customer that their pizza is next for delivery, the amount of the charge, the method of payment, and should arrive in the next few minutes, please listen for delivery signal &ldquo;honk honk.&rdquo; The incorporation of a unique honk code that matches the company advertising (&ldquo;haircut and a shave&mdash;two bits&rdquo; level of brand recognition also similar to a party line unique ring) is a relationship issue by establishing the next step and expectation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Further the call should confirm the correctness of the order by restating the order (via the recording) and allow for an IVR to make any corrections or adjustments. For example: &ldquo;This is Pizza Company calling to let you know that your 2 large thin crust pepperoni pizzas are next for delivery, the total charge being applied to your visa card is $14.95. If this is correct please press any key. Thank you, for ordering&mdash;Now, please listen for the delivery signal &lsquo;honk honk&rsquo; within the next few minutes&rdquo; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Note: the horn honk or other unique audible has a secondary benefit besides relationship uniqueness&mdash;it is also, a time tested and proven method to increase dietary demand and reward recognition (e.g. Pavlov&apos;s dog experiments, and the age old dinner bell). </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">What About a Second Call in a Short Time from the Last Order </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Second call from same ANT within predetermined time frames (e.g. 10 minutes of post scheduled delivery indicates an order problem and goes to live Customer service representative operator). The Customer service representative for disputes or order following should have their screen popped by ANT with the most recent order the deliver route map of that order a conference call link of the producing store and the next closest store. Also, the client&apos;s name pronunciation should be whispered to the Customer service representative prior to the call being connected. The Customer service representative screen is enabled to place a priority order (next in oven) if required to correct an order. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
