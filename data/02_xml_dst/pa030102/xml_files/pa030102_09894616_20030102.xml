<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to stethoscopes and other auscultation devices, and more particularly to the field of electronic stethoscopes. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Historically, a physician might have placed his ear against a patient&apos;s chest in an effort to detect suspicious sounds. The practice of listening to sounds emanating from a patient and drawing diagnoses or making a health assessment therefrom is called auscultation, the verb form being to auscultate. Unaided auscultation was an effective enough practice that the acoustic stethoscope was invented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A conventional acoustic stethoscope conveys sound from inside a patient to the ears of a physician or other health-care provider via acoustic tubes that isolate the signal. The acoustic tubes are coupled to the patient&apos;s body through a bell that may optionally be covered by an acoustic diaphragm. Stethoscopes are useful in that they both spatially isolate sounds and, through the use of an enlarged bell or parabola-shaped sound collecting area, may help to amplify sounds to a level high enough to distinguish over the ambient noise. Frequently, modern acoustic stethoscopes have two bells, each having a different diameter. The larger, diaphragm-covered bell is often used for general practice while the smaller diameter bell, frequently not covered by a diaphragm, is often used to distinguish more subtle sounds such as heart sounds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In the medical and health care arts, auscultation is combined with other practices to determine the health of a patient. In the case of a general or family practice, the stethoscope user must train for many hours to identify a plethora of possible pathological or pre-pathological conditions. Frequently, the identification by auscultation of obscure conditions or conditions that are accompanied by relatively obscure audio signs or signals is beyond the competence of general practice physicians and nursing personnel. In these cases, specialists may be able to readily identify the sound of a pathology that is in their field. Unfortunately, it is not practical, for a patient not having a known pathology, to consult specialists to auscultate for every possible condition in the hope of early discovery of any possible disease condition. Because of the need to control health care costs, it is often necessary for a disease process to mature sufficiently to exhibit itself in an overt manner prior to consulting with a specialist who otherwise may have been able to detect the incipient condition earlier through practiced auscultation, and/or detailed testing, for instance by echocardiogram. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In the field of stethoscope design, there has recently been an emergence of a variety of electronic stethoscopes. Examples are described in issued U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,844,995; 5,852,263; 5,932,849; 6,002,777; 6,005,951; 6,026,170 and 6,028,942, all hereby incorporated by reference. The electronic stethoscopes disclosed in the prior art share a common ability to amplify a detected signal. Additionally, some of these stethoscopes are equipped with audio equalizers to increase the relative volume of a pre-determined portion of the audio spectrum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Many current electronic stethoscopes are susceptible to failure in the event of electronic or battery failure. This can pose a significant inconvenience to the user or even render the instrument useless. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> As indicated above, certain attributes of the present invention relate to an electronic stethoscope or an electronic auscultation enhancement module that may be used to convert a conventional acoustic stethoscope to electronic operation. In some embodiments, some or all of the electronics module may be removably mounted to the bell of an acoustic stethoscope. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Turning now to the accompanying figures, we will examine some particular aspects of various embodiments of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> A numbering convention to facilitate easy understanding by the reader is used herein. Figures are numbered in conventional consecutive order. Specific features are generally indexed consecutively using three or four digit numbers in the order described. The first one or two digits correspond to the figure number in which the feature is first described. Features having similar functionality generally retain their originally assigned number throughout, even though their physical or logical appearance may vary considerably from figure to figure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A, a</cross-reference> cross-sectional view of one embodiment, shows several functional elements including a mechanism for removably mounting the electronics module <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> on the bell of a conventional acoustic stethoscope <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the specific instance of which is denoted as <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The electronics module <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is shown comprising housing halves <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>enclosing electronic components. A bell mount <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> includes receiving bore wall<highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, compressible member <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and sealing gasket <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. A receiving bore wall <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> extends downward from lower housing half <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and is shaped to receive stethoscope bell <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. A toroidic compressible member <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> contacts and fits the inserted stethoscope bell <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> inside the receiving bore wall <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. The specific instance of compressible member <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is denoted <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Compressible member <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may be held inside receiving bore wall <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> by compression fit, may optionally gain additional retention by means of retention lip <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> or may optionally be held in place by adhesive layer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Sealing gasket <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> may optionally be used to provide enhanced acoustic isolation and provide more positive seating of stethoscope bell <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Toroidic compressible member <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and gasket <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> may be comprised of a variety of materials such as polystyrene foam, natural or synthetic rubber, polybutadiene, closed-cell polyurethane foam, or other compressible material. In certain cases, it may be preferable to form gasket <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> with a higher modulus of elasticity than toroidic compression member <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to facilitate positive tactile response during insertion of stethoscope bell <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> To use bell mount <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> with a particular stethoscope having bell <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the user axially inserts the bell <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>into the passage of receiving bore <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and toroidic compression member <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> until seated against gasket <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. This may require some amount of force to overcome the elastic strength of toroid <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and friction between the surface of stethoscope bell <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and toroid <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. To overcome the latter, the user may be well served to exert a slight twisting motion while axially inserting the bell. To remove the auscultation aid from the acoustic stethoscope, the user reverses the insertion motion; pulling the bell mount <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and stethoscope bell apart axially while optionally applying a slight twisting motion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> also depicts cross-sections of other physical components of the electronic auscultation aid including microphone or detector <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>, electronics <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, battery pack <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, and speaker or emitter <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The interactivity of these portions of the unit will be described in greater detail later. For now, the reader&apos;s attention is drawn in part to a preferred position of microphone <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> approximately axial to and opposite stethoscope bell <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, behind a protective grill formed in the upper housing <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Speaker <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is also situated axially with respect to the bell centerline but in the bottom housing <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and facing bell <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The relative positions of these components should be governed by ergonomic, environmental, size, cost, weight, physical robustness, and sound fidelity considerations. Not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> are user controls or indicators, nor optional input/output (I/O) ports for external signal processing and/or distribution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view of bell mount <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> adapted to mount a bell <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>having substantially different geometry than bell <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>B, elastic toroid <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>has been substituted for elastic toroid <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the difference being in the inside diameters of the toroids. Toroid <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>has a smaller and more variable inside diameter than <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>for the purpose of receiving and retaining the substantially smaller outer diameter of stethoscope bell <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The elastic nature of receiving toroids of the present embodiment may allow them to accept and retain stethoscope bells having moderate differences in diameter and geometry without the necessity of changing toroids to fit. Indeed, features such as radially or rotationally variable elastic modulus, and/or the inclusion of radial ridges in the foam surface may tend to increase the range of bell diameters easily accommodated by a particular receiving toroid. However, the use of interchangeable receiving toroids may serve to increase the range of compatible stethoscope bell geometries and may help the user to obtain an optimum mechanical coupling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Receiving toroid <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>further includes optional adhesive for improving the retention of the elastic member in receiving bore <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. Adhesive layer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, which may be a pressure-sensitive adhesive, is coated in one or more places around the outer diameter of toroid <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Release liner <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> may be optionally used to protect adhesive layer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> during shipping and prior to installation of toroid <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>into receiving bore <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. For cases where a pressure sensitive adhesive is used, it may be preferable for such adhesive to be of a type having moderately low initial tack but relatively high ultimate peel strength relative to the material of receiving bore <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. This combination may help to facilitate easy installation and repositioning for a period of time while maintaining good mechanical robustness during subsequent usage. Pressure sensitive adhesives having suitable properties may be formulated from a natural or synthetic rubber base, acrylic emulsion base, acrylic solution base, block copolymer base, silicone base, or other suitable formulation known to the art. Release liner <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> may be formed from Kraft paper having a silicone release layer, polypropylene, or other material known to the art. In one embodiment, pressure sensitive adhesive <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and release layer <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> may be formed as transfer adhesive tape where a double-sided release liner and adhesive are self-wound. To apply to the retention toroid, a low release strength side of the release liner releases during unwinding of the tape, the tape is cut to a length corresponding to the outer diameter of the toroid, and the adhesive side is applied to the outer diameter of the toroid. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view of an alternative stethoscope bell receiving assembly <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. Boss <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, which may be formed integrally with housing <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, extends therefrom. Optionally, boss <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> may be formed as a continuous receiving bore wall as shown in antecedent figures, or may be formed as one or more non-continuous protuberances from housing <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. Lever <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> is rotatably coupled to boss <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> on shaft <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, and urged to rotate medially by spring <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> To install auscultation aid on stethoscope bell <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the user presses the actuation end of lever <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, denoted feature <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, laterally, thus rotating engagement end of lever <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, denoted feature <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, up and out of the path of the bell. After inserting bell <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to a point approximately corresponding to or closer than shaft <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, the user releases actuation end <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, thereby allowing engagement end <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to rotate against the underside of bell <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. This urges the face of bell <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> against the surface of housing <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and temporarily mounts the auscultation aid to the stethoscope. Optionally an acoustic gasket <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> may be formed on the surface of housing <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to aid in isolation of the air column inside the stethoscope. In the embodiment shown, two lever assemblies are shown for holding the stethoscope bell against the coupling surface of the auscultation aid. In practice, one lever, three levers, or more may be used effectively. Especially if two or fewer lever assemblies are used, it may be advantageous to bifurcate the engagement end of the lever <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to help keep the stethoscope bell centered or tangent relative to boss <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. If only one lever is used, an indexing feature such as that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference> below can be placed opposite boss <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> to locate the stethoscope bell relative to housing <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and provide positive engagement for lever <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> against the lower surface of bell <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view of another alternative mounting assembly. Indexing feature <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> is formed to one side of the emitter aperture in housing <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. A first end of strap <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is affixed to the medial surface of the indexing feature and wrapped circumferentially around stethoscope bell <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> such that, when tightened, the bell is held against both the indexing surface and against the coupling surface of housing <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. A buckle <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> may be used to secure the second end of strap <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is an isometric view of the bell mount shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> showing the first end of strap <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> affixed to indexing feature <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> by rivets <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, strap <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> by be affixed to indexing feature <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> by any number of known means including gluing, integral formation, clamping, heat staking, interference fitting, or any other means known to the art. The second end of strap <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> has a bale <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> fitted thereto for engaging buckle <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments, strap <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> may be formed from an elastic material such as natural or synthetic rubber, polyurethane, silicone, leather, or other material known to the art. This is useful in that it allows strap <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> to conform to the lower surface of mounted bell <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> (as shown more clearly on the right-hand cross-section of the strap in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) which, in turn, helps to urge the bell against the mating surface of housing <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> or optional gasket <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> (not shown). If strap <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is from a flexible but inelastic material, then elasticity may be gained by means of a bale <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> having integral springs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows an alternative embodiment of bell mount <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> using set screws <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> passing through bosses <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. The set-screws may be conveniently adjusted to press against the underside of bell <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, thus urging it against the mating surface of housing <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> or optional acoustic gasket <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, as shown. As in other embodiments, bosses <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> may be formed as portions of a continuous cylindrical wall or, alternatively, as individual protuberances from housing <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. In a preferred embodiment, setscrews <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> are formed from a relatively soft material such nylon, Noryl, brass, or other material to avoid their tips from scratching the underside of bell <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, soft tips may be installed on setscrews formed from harder materials. In principle, any number of setscrews may be used but a preferred number is three. If only one or two setscrews are used, then an indexing feature <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> should be used opposed the set-screw(s) to create a positive location limit for the stethoscope bell <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view of an alternative embodiment for bell mount <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment a pliable cup <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> is used to receive stethoscope bell <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The pliable elastic cup may be formed, for instance, by injection molding silicone, polyurethane, latex, or other suitable material. This one-piece cup may be affixed to housing <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> via an interference-fit circumferential channel <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> such as shown, or alternatively may use other suitable known means such as gluing, riveting, heat-staking, etc. Pliable cup <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> may additionally be formed monolithically or may be formed from two or more substances by, for instance, co-molding. Mounting cup <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> may include a perforated region <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight> to bridge the emitter aperture. While many flexible materials are inherently unstable, this region can help stabilize the cup by providing elasticity across the bell diameter, thus reducing stress load on circumferential channel <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>. Insertion and removal of the stethoscope bell may be aided by applying silicone, talc, Teflon powder, or other lubricant to the inside of the cup. Alternatively, the surface of the material may be impregnated with one or more of such materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The bell mount <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is typically mounted on the stethoscope by applying a twisting motion between the bell <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and housing <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> while applying axial force to seat the stethoscope bell. In some instances, it may be useful to fully seat one edge of the bell in the cup and twist the opposite edge in. Removal of the auscultation aid from the stethoscope may be similarly accomplished by applying a twisting motion while applying axial tension between the cup and the stethoscope bell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view of another alternative embodiment that makes use of a semi-permanent bracket attached to the bell of an acoustic stethoscope, the bracket in turn having provision for mating to features in the housing <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> of the auscultation aid. Bracket <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> is semi-permanently attached to the user&apos;s stethoscope bell, optionally using gasket <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> therebetween to obtain a mechanically and acoustically tight fit. Such attachment may be made by a number of known approaches including the use of one or more screws between halves of the bracket, by gluing, or by using heat softening or positive coefficient of thermal expansion characteristics of the material to seat while hot. Once installed on the stethoscope bell, bracket <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> has a known geometry and may be removably attached to housing <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> using a number of known processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In the example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the outer surface of bracket <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> has a threaded coupling and the inner surface of receiving bore <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> has corresponding threads for easy screw-on attachment of the auscultation device. Also evident is optional gasket <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> which may help form a tight acoustic seal and provide a known coefficient of friction against the corresponding surface of bracket <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight>, gasket <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight>, and/or the face of stethoscope bell <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, mating surfaces of bracket <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> and receiving bore <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> may be reversed such that bracket <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> is affixed to the inside of bell <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, threads of bracket <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> are on its inside diameter, and mating threads of receiving bore <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> are on its outside diameter. In still another approach, bracket <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> and receiving bore <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> may be formed to create a bayonet-mount or other coupling in place of the screw coupling shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> As another alternative to the approach described above with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, bracket <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> may be formed integrally with stethoscope bell <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> as a single circumferential feature or as discrete features formed at points around the circumference of stethoscope bell <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. In this instance, such features may be formed for instance by casting, machining, molding, or other means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the fit between housing <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and stethoscope bell <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may be magnetic in nature as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9, a</cross-reference> cross-sectional depiction, housing <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> contains one or more magnets, shown as <highlight><bold>901</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>901</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. For the case of a stethoscope bell comprised of a ferrous material such as chrome-plated steel, these magnets alone may be sufficient to securely but temporarily attach the housing <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to bell <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. For the case of a non-ferrous stethoscope bell such as one comprised of aluminum or stainless steel, auxiliary coupler <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> may be attached to the bell to provide a material responsive to the magnetic field of magnets <highlight><bold>901</bold></highlight>. In one case, auxiliary coupler <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> may be comprised of a one-piece magnetic strip attached to the bell by means of pressure sensitive adhesive. In another case auxiliary coupler <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> may be comprised of discrete magnets or even of a ferrous material having no magnetic field of its own. Alternatively, auxiliary coupler <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> may be formed integrally with stethoscope bell <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Turning now to the electronics, the block diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> shows the main components of one embodiment. Housing <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> contains a microphone <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> carried by housing <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and positioned to detect sounds for auscultation. Amplifier <highlight><bold>1001</bold></highlight> amplifies signals from microphone <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. Amplified signals may then be output by speaker <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, positioned so as to emit sounds into an acoustic stethoscope to which housing <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> may be coupled. Speaker <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> may be disposed so as to emit amplified audio power into one or more air columns of a conventional acoustic stethoscope to which auscultation aid <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> may be attached. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments, additional features may be added as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. Microphone <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> may be positioned to detect sounds from an auscultation subject. Signals from microphone <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> may be amplified to a usable level by pre-amplifier <highlight><bold>1101</bold></highlight> which may be a simple pre-amplifier known to the art and may also contain additional functionality such as non-linear amplification, output level limit circuitry, input level detection circuitry, etc. Output from pre-amplifier <highlight><bold>1101</bold></highlight> may be passed to optional signal processor <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> which may, for instance, provide functionality such as bandpass filtering, non-linear filtering, output level limiting, power saving circuitry, audio compression, signal augmentation, etc. In addition, signal processor <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> may include analog-to-digital (A/D) conversion. In certain embodiments, a digital representation of a signal detected by microphone <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> may be passed to a micro-controller <highlight><bold>1103</bold></highlight>. Output from optional signal processor <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> may be passed to main amplifier <highlight><bold>1001</bold></highlight>, which in turn powers output speaker <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Signal processor <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> may comprise, for instance, a digital switch for routing signals between pre-amplifier <highlight><bold>1101</bold></highlight>, controller <highlight><bold>1103</bold></highlight>, and amplifier <highlight><bold>1001</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Controller <highlight><bold>1103</bold></highlight> may control the operation of pre-amplifier <highlight><bold>1101</bold></highlight>, optional signal processor <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>, and amplifier <highlight><bold>1001</bold></highlight>. Input-output (I/O) block <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight> may receive control input by the user, display feedback to the user, transmit a signal to a remote device, or receive a signal from a remote device. Control input available to the user may include some or all of power on/off, volume, passband characteristics, signal processor in/out, power saving mode, audio compression on/off, audio compression magnitude, signal capture trigger, signal transmit, signal receive, channel select, sample residual analysis on/off, sample residual play, sample residual/library residual toggle, library residual increment, residual play/residual superimpose toggle, and residual/sample balance. Controller <highlight><bold>1103</bold></highlight> may also by controlled by computer input/ouput using a mouse, voice recognition, etc. Additionally, control circuitry <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> may include provision for indicator signals including display, LED, and audio. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Signals transmitted between pre-amplifier <highlight><bold>1101</bold></highlight> and controller <highlight><bold>1103</bold></highlight>, between signal processor <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> and controller <highlight><bold>1103</bold></highlight>, between amplifier <highlight><bold>1001</bold></highlight> and controller <highlight><bold>1103</bold></highlight>, and between I/O block <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight> and controller <highlight><bold>1103</bold></highlight> may comprise, for instance digital control signals such as enable lines and control bytes, analog signals representing audio signals, digital signals representing audio signals, and power lines. Power supply <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> may comprise batteries or other conventional power sources for powering the auscultation aid. Such power may be selectively switched by controller <highlight><bold>1103</bold></highlight> upon user or automatic input to controller <highlight><bold>1103</bold></highlight> via I/O block <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight>, pre-amplifier <highlight><bold>1101</bold></highlight>, or signal processor <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments, such input may comprise manual turn-on by a user activating a power button. Power may be automatically shut off to conserve battery life after a pre-determined period of time. Additionally, logic may switch between power-saving and operation modes. In the latter case, automatic detection of the operational condition of the auscultation aid may determine when to toggle these modes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments, the functions of some of the components shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference> may be combined. For example, microphone <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> may be combined with an integrated pre-amplifier <highlight><bold>1101</bold></highlight>. Speaker <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> may be combined with an integrated amplifier <highlight><bold>1001</bold></highlight>. Components such as these are available, for instance, in the hearing aid trade and may be especially useful for minimizing the size of an auscultation aid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> illustrates the operation of one automatic power-saving approach. I/O block <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight> includes a signal emitter <highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight> such as a light-emitting diode (LED) or ultrasonic emitter (for &ldquo;active sonar&rdquo;) and a signal detector <highlight><bold>1205</bold></highlight> corresponding to the signal emitted by signal emitter <highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight>. In the case where signal emitter <highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight> is an infrared (IR) LED, signal detector <highlight><bold>1205</bold></highlight> could be a photo-diode with sensitivity comprising the IR wavelength emitted by signal emitter <highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight>. In operation, signal emitter <highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight> can emit interrogation signal <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight>. In the case where target surface <highlight><bold>1203</bold></highlight>, for instance the surface of an auscultation subject, is present in a position for listening, the surface <highlight><bold>1203</bold></highlight> reflects interrogation signal <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight> as detection signal <highlight><bold>1204</bold></highlight>. Signal detector <highlight><bold>1205</bold></highlight> identifies the reflected interrogation signal and provides a corresponding output signal to controller <highlight><bold>1103</bold></highlight>. Controller <highlight><bold>1103</bold></highlight> detects a ready condition and switches the auscultation aid into an &ldquo;on&rdquo; condition by powering-up all necessary circuitry. On the other hand, in the absence of surface <highlight><bold>1203</bold></highlight>, interrogation signal <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight> emits beyond the detection range of detector <highlight><bold>1205</bold></highlight> as indicated by signal <highlight><bold>1206</bold></highlight>. This situation corresponds to a not ready condition and causes controller <highlight><bold>1103</bold></highlight> to switch the auscultation aid into a &ldquo;standby&rdquo; condition, thus reducing power consumption. Accordingly, the auscultation aid can conserve power through what is effectively a proximity detector. Other types of proximity detectors, such as pressure switches or position sensors may similarly activate the auscultation aid. In addition to saving power, a proximity detector may reduce interference with EKG, ultrasound, or other equipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> While in standby, the detection apparatus of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> may be pulsed intermittently, and thus itself operate in a manner that conserves power. To improve immunity to ambient conditions, emitter <highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight> may by cycled relatively rapidly to eliminate &ldquo;zero drift&rdquo;. </paragraph>

This, for instance, may reduce the incidence of rapid cycling between stand-by and on conditions while changing auscultation locations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> In another power-saving embodiment (&ldquo;passive sonar&rdquo;), controller <highlight><bold>1103</bold></highlight> may sample a signal via microphone <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> illustrates a characteristic audio signal corresponding to a standby condition <highlight><bold>1301</bold></highlight> and a characteristic audio signal corresponding to an on condition <highlight><bold>1302</bold></highlight>. Signals <highlight><bold>1301</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1302</bold></highlight> illustrate RMS received audio signal versus frequency. Note that when the auscultation aid is positioned in the open air, corresponding to signal <highlight><bold>1301</bold></highlight>, audio power is relatively high and the power is received over a relatively broad frequency range. Conversely, when the microphone is positioned against the auscultation subject and the air column therebetween is sealed, the received audio power is both reduced and high frequency components are reduced as illustrated by curve <highlight><bold>1302</bold></highlight>. The signal level, its spectrum, or both may be used to detect the condition of the auscultation aid and control toggling between stand-by and on conditions. Furthermore, this apparatus and method may be used in conjunction with the apparatus and method illustrated by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> is a flow chart that illustrates an implementation of power-saving logic for use in conjunction with the aforementioned detection methods and apparatuses. After the auscultation aid is powered-up, for instance in response to the user pushing an &ldquo;ON&rdquo; button, by external command via I/O block <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight>, or by installing batteries <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, status test <highlight><bold>1402</bold></highlight> is performed. In the case where an IR emitter-detector pair is used, this test may involve monitoring of signal level received by photo-detector <highlight><bold>1205</bold></highlight>. If emitter light is substantially reflected, then the apparatus is deemed ready for auscultation as shown by decision step <highlight><bold>1403</bold></highlight>, and the controller enters active mode as per block <highlight><bold>1404</bold></highlight> wherein the auscultation aid is powered to provide operation as selected by the user. In many cases, this means that signal processor <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> is powered to provide signal processing as selected by the user and power amplifier <highlight><bold>1001</bold></highlight> is powered to provide output through speaker <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> at a level determined by the user. While in active mode, status test <highlight><bold>1402</bold></highlight> may be repeated, either constantly or intermittently to determine if the device should continue in the ON condition. Such testing may take place over a number of instances, to allow for brief periods out of auscultation range, before decision block <highlight><bold>1403</bold></highlight> determines the device is no longer ready for auscultation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Upon determining that the auscultation aid is not in auscultation position, for instance by determining that a low level of IR signal has be detected by detector <highlight><bold>1205</bold></highlight>, the device may, depending upon user preferences, enter sleep or stand-by mode. In stand-by mode, portions of the circuit may be shut down to reduce power consumption and/or portions may be operated in a mode that reduces power consumption. Intermittently or continuously thereafter, status testing may be repeated to determine if the device has entered a position associated with active mode. Optionally, a timer may be activated to determine an amount of time, number of clock cycles, number of system ticks, number of tests, or the like that has elapsed since entering sleep mode. If optional test <highlight><bold>1406</bold></highlight> determines that a sufficient number of events have occurred, the auscultation aid may optionally be completely powered down as indicated by process <highlight><bold>1407</bold></highlight>. In the case where a power-down condition is entered, processes shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> are suspended and an external event indicated by block <highlight><bold>1401</bold></highlight> may be necessary to restart the process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> is a block diagram of an embodiment that allows for remote control, remote signal processing, or input of remotely generated audio signals. Switch block <highlight><bold>1501</bold></highlight> may be positioned to receive a pre-amplified output signal from pre-amplifier <highlight><bold>1101</bold></highlight>. In one mode, the input signal may be connected directly to power amplifier <highlight><bold>1001</bold></highlight> for reproduction by speaker <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. In another mode, the input signal may be routed through signal processor <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> for signal conditioning prior to being sent back to the power amplifier <highlight><bold>1001</bold></highlight> by switch block <highlight><bold>1501</bold></highlight>. In another mode, the input signal may split, a first portion being sent to mixer <highlight><bold>1512</bold></highlight>, and a second portion being routed through signal processor <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> prior to being remixed with the input signal in mixer <highlight><bold>1512</bold></highlight>. Mixer <highlight><bold>1512</bold></highlight> may include a synchronization apparatus to account for propagation and/or processing delay differences between the signal paths. In another mode, all or a portion of output from pre-amplifier <highlight><bold>1501</bold></highlight> may be routed through a transmitter <highlight><bold>1502</bold></highlight> and antenna <highlight><bold>1503</bold></highlight> to a remote antenna <highlight><bold>1505</bold></highlight> and remote receiver <highlight><bold>1506</bold></highlight>. This may be performed, for instance, by converting the auscultation signal to a streaming format such as MPS. Remote receiver <highlight><bold>1506</bold></highlight> may optionally be coupled to a computer network <highlight><bold>1507</bold></highlight> to one or more remote computers <highlight><bold>1508</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> In one mode, the signal received by remote device <highlight><bold>1508</bold></highlight> may be used to select operational modes for the auscultation device. In this mode, control signals for selecting operating characteristics of the auscultation aid may be passed to signal processor <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> via remote link <highlight><bold>1509</bold></highlight>, through receiving antenna <highlight><bold>1510</bold></highlight> and through receiver <highlight><bold>1511</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> In another mode, remote device <highlight><bold>1508</bold></highlight> may perform remote signal processing and pass a processed signal back to local signal processor <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> for mixing at mixer <highlight><bold>1512</bold></highlight> via link <highlight><bold>1509</bold></highlight>. One use for this mode is for comparison to and presentation of library images of stored auscultation profiles. This can enable the user of the auscultation aid to compare the detected signal against known pathologies, for instance alternately listening to the subject signal and switching through one or more reference signals. Alternatively, information from the reference signal can be used to boost a portion of the live signal to draw attention to that portion that may be associated with a pathology. Alternatively, the user may elect to play a live residual signal alone as a way of eliminating signals associated with normal body functions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Trigger <highlight><bold>1513</bold></highlight> may be used to conveniently enable transmit/receive or to select auscultation profiles or toggle between modes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Mixer <highlight><bold>1512</bold></highlight> may be used to synchronize signals passed through the top circuit of switch <highlight><bold>1501</bold></highlight> and those that pass through signal processor <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>. Mixer <highlight><bold>1512</bold></highlight> may be further used to select balance between the two signals. In some embodiments, a direct signal from the pre-amplifier may be played through a first speaker <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> into a first binaural and a second signal from signal processor <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> into a second binaural through a second speaker. This arrangement allows the user to hear a live signal through one ear and a processed or reference signal through the other ear. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> is a flow chart illustrating a method for comparing a sample auscultation signal against a library of signals characteristic of pathological and pre-pathological conditions for the purpose of aiding diagnosis. An input signal is received via microphone <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> (not shown) in block <highlight><bold>1601</bold></highlight>. The sampling period may be selected to contain at least a full cycle of the sounds of interest. For example, depending upon the nature of the auscultation, a full cycle may comprise a full heartbeat cycle, a full respiration cycle, or some other period. In some applications, the sample auscultation signal may be a portion of the detected signal as split, for instance, using the apparatus of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. Next, the input signal is transformed to a set of standard conditions in block <highlight><bold>1602</bold></highlight>. This may include changing the period or frequency of the input signal to match one or more of a set of standard conditions stored in profile library <highlight><bold>1604</bold></highlight>. For instance, if library <highlight><bold>1604</bold></highlight> contains a full set of conditions at heart rates of 60, 65, 70, etc. beats per minute and the input signal is determined to correspond to 67 beats per minute; then the input signal may be electronically altered to raise its apparent heart rate to 70 beats per minute. This results in matching the input signal to a library standard condition. In general, it is preferable to raise the frequency (reduce the period) of the input signal to allow for later recombination without losing information. The input signal may also differ in relative volume or equalization from library standards. These differences may similarly be compensated for by transforming the input standard using equalization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> After compensation, the input signal is compared, for instance sequentially, against profile signals stored in library <highlight><bold>1604</bold></highlight>. Selection logic <highlight><bold>1605</bold></highlight> may serve to select most likely matches first and may ultimately select the best fit from an array of choices. A best-fit library profile is played in block <highlight><bold>1606</bold></highlight>, which assembles one or a few periods of the library profile into a substantially continuously repeating pattern. The selected library signal is transformed and synchronized to a best match with the input signal using an inverse of the transformation performed in block <highlight><bold>1602</bold></highlight>. Thus, according to the example described above, the 70 beat-per-minute library signal may be slowed down to match the 67 beat-per-minute input signal with each successive period being synchronized to the input signal. Similarly, any equalization performed in block <highlight><bold>1602</bold></highlight> may be inverted to produce a transformation of a library signal that is matched to the input signal. The matched output signal may then be played through speaker <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Such a signal allows the user to compare known pathological or pre-pathological conditions against the auscultation subject. In practice, the user may toggle between the live signal and playback signal for rapid comparison and may increment through a series of best-fit library signals, each optionally dynamically matched to the present conditions of the input signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> illustrates a method of transforming a sample auscultation signal to emphasize non-nominal components and optionally for comparing the non-nominal components to a library of pathological and pre-pathological components. In step <highlight><bold>1601</bold></highlight>, a sample signal is received. This may be, for instance, a continuously streaming signal received from pre-amplifier <highlight><bold>1101</bold></highlight> and optionally converted into a digital format. Next, as shown by step <highlight><bold>1701</bold></highlight>, a nominal signal representing a best-fit baseline pattern is determined. This may be done, for instance, by selecting from a plurality of possible nominal signals stored in library <highlight><bold>1604</bold></highlight>. Such possible matches may be stored in uncompressed or in compressed form in library <highlight><bold>1604</bold></highlight> so as allow direct selection of a nominal signal. Alternatively or in combination, one or more nominal signals stored in library <highlight><bold>1604</bold></highlight> may be transformed to match amplitude, equalization, and period of the received sample signal. Alternatively, a nominal signal may be generated algorithmically, optionally as a function of the sample signal itself. A nominal signal represents a healthy signal for an individual matching the characteristics of the auscultation subject, for instance matching the auscultation location, the age, gender, and body weight of the subject. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The nominal signal is synchronized to the input signal in step <highlight><bold>1702</bold></highlight> to match a repeating nominal signal to the phase of the input signal and optionally to track any changes in input signal period or other characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Next, the nominal signal may be mathematically combined with the input signal as indicated in step <highlight><bold>1704</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the nominal signal may be inverted and added to the input signal to produce a sample residual signal <highlight><bold>1705</bold></highlight>. Sample residual signal <highlight><bold>1705</bold></highlight> thus represents non-nominal characteristics of the sample signal. These may include, for instance heart murmurs, implanted heart valve sounds, bronchial wheezing, high frequency whistling caused by air movement past an obstruction, or other pathological and pre-pathological conditions. Similarly, the input signal can be signal processed by identifying the spectral content of the non-nominal characteristics and filtering or otherwise reducing the nominal components relative to the non-nominal characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment, sample residual <highlight><bold>1705</bold></highlight> is sequentially compared against library residual signals in step <highlight><bold>1706</bold></highlight>. As with the sample residual <highlight><bold>1705</bold></highlight>, library residuals represent differences from nominal. These may include a wide array of known pathological and pre-pathological conditions to which the sample residual is compared. Library residuals that most closely match the sample residual signals are selected using one or more fitting algorithms in step <highlight><bold>1707</bold></highlight>. Such fitting algorithms may, for instance, include least-squares fit, analysis of variance, or other known techniques. A best-fit library residual <highlight><bold>1708</bold></highlight> is selected by step <highlight><bold>1707</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Having a sample residual <highlight><bold>1705</bold></highlight> and a library residual <highlight><bold>1708</bold></highlight> available, the user may toggle between the residuals. The selected residual may be superimposed over the sample signal or may be played alone as shown by step <highlight><bold>1710</bold></highlight>. In the case where the sample residual is selected, the superposition of signals has the effect of emphasizing those aspects of the sample signal that are non-nominal or abnormal. For instance, mechanical heart valve clicking could be made somewhat louder than in the original input signal so as to draw attention to such sounds. Similarly, other abnormalities could also be emphasized. For the case where the residual signal is selected to be played alone, the effect is one of active noise cancellation wherein the sounds of normal body functions are attenuated relative to the sounds associated with a selected pathology or pre-pathology. In this mode, the act of comparing the sample residuals to library residuals is optional. Simply the act of attenuating normal sounds with a stored or synthesized nominal signal has the effect of drawing the practitioner&apos;s attention to unusual auscultation features. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> For the case where the library residual is selected, non-nominal or abnormal sounds characteristics of a known pathological or pre-pathological condition may be superimposed over the input signal. By toggling back and forth between the sample residual and library residual, the user may rapidly and conveniently compare the auscultation subject&apos;s heart, lung, or other sounds to those of a known pathology. The known pathology may be displayed to the user, shown in step <highlight><bold>1711</bold></highlight>, using a local or remote display, for instance an LCD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> The user may also increment and decrement between best-fit library residuals as shown in step <highlight><bold>1712</bold></highlight>. Thus, the user may compare the auscultation subject&apos;s sounds against a plurality of most likely pathological and pre-pathological conditions and, in effect, receive expert consultation even for obscure conditions that might otherwise be missed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> is a block diagram of an embodiment of the present invention having record and playback functionality. As with earlier block diagrams, low-level signals from microphone <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> are amplified to usable levels by pre-amplifier <highlight><bold>1101</bold></highlight>. Pre-amplifier <highlight><bold>1101</bold></highlight> outputs to band pass filter <highlight><bold>1801</bold></highlight>. Band pass filter <highlight><bold>1801</bold></highlight> may optionally be programmable via equalizer control lines from programmable controller <highlight><bold>1103</bold></highlight>. During normal operation, output from band pass filter <highlight><bold>1801</bold></highlight> is sent to power amplifier <highlight><bold>1001</bold></highlight> and on to output speaker <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> which may be placed to as to emit into one or more air columns of a stethoscope. Optionally, line-out jack <highlight><bold>1805</bold></highlight> may be used to connect the output signal to one or more external devices, either in place of outputting through output speaker <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> or in parallel to output speaker <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Volume control <highlight><bold>1802</bold></highlight> may be used to control the gain of power amplifier <highlight><bold>1001</bold></highlight>, and hence adjust for a comfortable listening level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Programmable controller <highlight><bold>1103</bold></highlight>, upon activation by record or playback controls <highlight><bold>1803</bold></highlight>, may optionally enable record and playback apparatus <highlight><bold>1804</bold></highlight> to capture an auscultation signal from band pass filter <highlight><bold>1801</bold></highlight>. In some embodiments, record and playback apparatus <highlight><bold>1804</bold></highlight> may provisionally store an auscultation signal on, for instance, a first-in, first-out basis. Upon receipt of a record trigger from the user or upon signal matching to a library profile, a non-volatile recording may then be made including a portion of signal from before receipt of the trigger. This feature can be useful for capturing signals that include events leading up to triggering events as well as post-trigger signals. Upon receipt of a record command or trigger, record and playback apparatus may capture a period of auscultation signal. Subsequently, a playback command may cause the recorded signal to be played back through output speaker <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and/or through line out jack <highlight><bold>1805</bold></highlight> for distribution to one or more external devices. Playback through line out jack <highlight><bold>1805</bold></highlight> may be useful, for instance, for consultation purposes, for teaching purposes, and for medical record-keeping purposes. In some embodiments record and play apparatus <highlight><bold>1804</bold></highlight> may record images of auscultation signals in a streaming data format or a standard streaming data format. In some embodiments, record and play apparatus <highlight><bold>1804</bold></highlight> may record in an MP3 digital audio format. Optionally, programmable controller <highlight><bold>1103</bold></highlight> may transmit a digital recording such as an MP3 recording directly to one or more external devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> During playback, pre-amplifier <highlight><bold>1101</bold></highlight> and band pass filter <highlight><bold>1801</bold></highlight> may be shut off to avoid injection of a spurious auscultation signal and for power saving. Powering of various components of the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> may be controlled via switch <highlight><bold>1806</bold></highlight> under command from programmable controller <highlight><bold>1103</bold></highlight> and optionally directly from power button <highlight><bold>1803</bold></highlight> and optionally by low battery sensing circuit <highlight><bold>1807</bold></highlight>. When low battery sensing circuit senses low voltage in battery <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, it may optionally shut off power via solid state switch <highlight><bold>1806</bold></highlight> to avoid placing components in ambiguous logic states. Subsequent connection to external power, replacement of batteries, or recharging of batteries may optionally cause low battery sensing circuit <highlight><bold>1807</bold></highlight> to re-enable switch <highlight><bold>1806</bold></highlight> to provide power to selected components. </paragraph>
