<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">Provided is a method for increasing an etching selectivity of photoresist material. The method initiates with providing a substrate with a developed photoresist layer. The developed photoresist layer on the substrate is formulated to contain a hardening agent. Next, the substrate is exposed to a gas, where the gas is formulated to interact with the hardening agent. A portion of the developed photoresist layer is then converted to a hardened layer where the hardened layer is created by an interaction of the hardening agent with the gas. Some notable advantages of the discussed methods of increasing the selectivity of a photoresist include improved etch profile control. Additionally, by combining fabrication steps such as the hardening of the photoresist in an etch chamber, downstream etching processes may be performed without having to transfer the wafer to an additional chamber, thereby improving wafer throughput while minimizing handling. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to lithography and more particularly to a method and apparatus for increasing the selectivity of a silicon containing photoresist layer to improve profile control of etched features without decreasing wafer throughput. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The ability to work selectively on small well defined areas of a substrate is paramount in the manufacture of semiconductor devices. In the continuing quest to achieve higher levels of performance and higher functional density of the semiconductor devices, the microelectronics industry is committed to applying new processes to further reduce the minimum feature sizes of the semiconductor devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> As the feature sizes are reduced, the devices can become smaller or remain the same size but become more densely packed. As such, advances in lithographic technologies used to pattern the semiconductor devices must keep pace with the progress to reduce feature sizes, in order to allow for smaller and more dense. For example, one of the main ways to reduce the device critical dimensions (CD) through lithographic technologies has been to continually reduce the wavelength of the radiation used to expose the photoresist. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Sharp lithographic transmission becomes more of a challenge as wafers progress to higher density chips with shrinking geometries. Furthermore, as metallization transitions to dual damascene processes, lithography techniques to pattern holes or trenches in the dielectric become more critical. In particular, the photoresists employed in the lithographic techniques must provide for proper selectivity so that downstream etching processes yield sharp profiles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Photoresists are typically polymeric materials consisting of multi-component formulations. Additionally, a photoresist may be applied as a single layer or as multiple layers where one of the layers contains silicon. Multi-layered photoresists tend to offer superior formation of a pattern, therefore, the multi-layered photoresists are desirable as semiconductor devices become smaller. However, resist compositions containing silicon have either failed to deliver adequate improvement in etch resistance or have had poor processing performance due to the unacceptable selectivity past the silicon containing layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> As a result, there is a need to solve the problems of the prior art to improve the selectivity past the developed photoresist layer containing silicon, without simultaneously decreasing wafer throughput, so that during etching there is improved ability to distinguish between silicon containing photoresists and non silicon containing photoresists or the dielectric. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Broadly speaking, the present invention fills these needs by providing a photoresist layer that has been hardened to increase the selectivity of the hardened photoresist layer relative to an underlying photoresist or underlying dielectric. In addition, the hardening process may take place in an etch chamber so that the fabrication, e.g., etching steps, may be combined with treating processes to improve wafer throughput. It should be appreciated that the present invention can be implemented in numerous ways, including as an apparatus, a system, a device, or a method. Several inventive embodiments of the present invention are described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, an apparatus for exposing a photoresist-developed substrate is provided. In this embodiment, a chamber is included where the chamber has at least one gas inlet adapted to introduce a gas into the chamber. Also included is a support within the chamber. A substrate on the support where the substrate has at least one developed photoresist layer is included. The substrate is exposed to a curing environment within the chamber where the curing environment is defined through the introduction of the gas through the gas inlet and causing at least a portion of the developed photoresist layer to convert to a hardened layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the invention an apparatus for curing a photoresist is provided. In this embodiment, a chamber having at least one gas inlet adapted for introducing a gas into the chamber and a support within the chamber are included. A substrate on the support where the substrate has a first photoresist layer and a second photoresist layer is included. The first photoresist layer is formulated to contain a hardening agent where the hardening agent interacts with the gas to form a hardened layer from a top region of the first photoresist layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In yet another embodiment of the invention, a method for increasing a selectivity of a photoresist is provided. The method initiates with providing a substrate with a developed photoresist layer, the developed photoresist layer being formulated to contain a hardening agent. Next, the substrate is exposed to a gas, where the gas is formulated to interact with the hardening agent. Finally, a portion of the developed photoresist layer is converted to a hardened layer where the hardened layer is created by an interaction of the hardening agent with the gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the invention, a method for curing a photoresist is provided. The method initiates with providing a substrate with a first photoresist layer and a second photoresist layer. The first photoresist layer is developed and disposed over the second photoresist layer and the first photoresist layer is formulated to contain a hardening agent. Next, the first photoresist layer is exposed to a curing environment where the curing environment includes a gas for interacting with the hardening agent. The method terminates after converting a portion of the first photoresist layer to a hardened layer where the hardened layer is configured to increase a selectivity ratio. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In still yet another embodiment a method for curing a photoresist disposed on a wafer within an etch chamber is provided. The method initiates with the introduction of a gas into the chamber through a process gas inlet, where the gas in the etch chamber defines a curing environment. Next, a wafer having a developed photoresist is exposed to the curing environment. Here, the photoresist is formulated so as to contain a hardening agent. Then, the hardening agent interacts with the curing environment, thereby converting a portion of the developed photoresist layer to a hardened layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The advantages of the present invention are numerous. Most notably, the formation of the hardened layer increases the selectivity ratio of the underlying photoresist layer or interlayer dielectric relative to the hardened layer of the top photoresist layer. Accordingly, any etch processes performed on the substrate with the hardened layer will etch through the underlying photoresist layer or interlayer dielectric at an increased rate relative to the etch rate of the hardened layer. Furthermore, the etch profile control will be improved as a result of the increased selectivity, thereby allowing for more accurate etch profiles as semiconductor device features continue to shrink. Additionally, an etch chamber may be utilized for curing the hardened layer. As a result, after the curing process, the substrate may be etched in the same chamber. Hence, throughput is increased and handling of the substrate is minimized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Other aspects and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, illustrating by way of example the principles of the invention. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> An invention is described for an apparatus and a method for enhancing the selectivity of a silicon-containing photoresist thereby improving etch profile control. It will be obvious, however, to one skilled in the art, that the present invention may be practiced without some or all of these specific details. In other instances, well known process operations have not been described in detail in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The embodiments of the present invention provide an apparatus and method for an improved selectivity of a silicon-containing photoresist which in turn, allows for amelioration of a subsequent etch profile. In one embodiment, a hardened layer is formed in a silicon-containing photoresist in the presence of an oxygen-containing or nitrogen containing curing environment. The hardened layer has an increased selectivity relative to an underlying photoresist layer or an underlying interlayer dielectric ILD. Accordingly, the increased selectivity allows for tighter control of future etching processes, particularly with respect to dual damascene processing. For instance, as device features continue to decrease in size, the aspect ratio of many of the features increases, which in turn makes etching more of a challenge. Just as significant, the formation of the hardened layer can take place in an etch chamber. The etch chamber can be configured to control various process parameters as discussed below. In addition, once the silicon-containing photoresist has been hardened, downstream etching processes may occur in the etch chamber without the need to remove the wafer. Consequently, wafer throughput is increased by combining fabrication steps into a single system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates a block diagram <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, displaying a substrate in which the top photoresist layer is being exposed in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, light <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> from a light source (not shown) passes through a glass reticle <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The light <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> will not pass through the reticle in the opaque areas <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, the light <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is ultraviolet light. It should be appreciated that a mask pattern is applied to the glass reticle <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> in which certain areas allow light <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to pass through, while others prevent light <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> from passing through, thereby exposing a pattern on the substrate <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. For example, the mask pattern may be formed in emulsion, chrome, iron oxide, silicon and the like. In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, the reticle is a mask containing the full die array needed to define one process layer for the entire wafer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Continuing with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the light <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> passes through the unblocked areas <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> of the reticle <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to the substrate <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. The substrate <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> contains a top layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of silicon-containing photoresist over a second layer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> of a non silicon-containing photoresist. An example of the silicon-containing photoresist is Fuji-film TIS-200-IL-7 and an example of the non silicon-photoresist is Fuji film TIS-200-IL-5, both of which may be purchased from Arch Chemicals, Inc. of Norwalk, Conn. As depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the second layer of non silicon-containing oxide resides over an interlayer dielectric (ILD) <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. In accordance with one embodiment of the invention the ILD <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is silicon dioxide. In a dual-damascene structure, metal lines <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> are formed in another ILD <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>&prime;. The metal lines <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> are copper in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. Although, the underlying features can be any features, so long as access is made to them by etching. The etching performance, however, is significantly improved due to the robust selectivity provided by the treating environment, which is disclosed below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates block diagram <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> depicting a developed substrate <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. The top layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of silicon-containing photoresist has been developed to remove the silicon-containing photoresist from regions <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, which were exposed to light <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Regions <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of the silicon-containing photoresist remain on the top layer of substrate <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. The bottom layer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> of non silicon-containing photoresist remains intact. As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the development process removed the silicon-containing photoresist to the border <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> between the top layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of photoresist and the bottom layer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> of photoresist. In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, the development method may be continuous spray development, puddle development, etc. It should be appreciated that the photoresist <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> exposed to light in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, becomes more soluble, so that during development the exposed photoresist <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is removed, as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2 </cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> While the above exposure and development of the photoresist has been described for a positive resist, it is understood that the apparatus and method is equally applicable for a negative resist. For example, with a negative resist, the reticle or mask <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> would be modified so as to expose regions <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and not expose regions <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> of the silicon-containing photoresist layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. For this embodiment, the exposed regions <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> become less soluble than unexposed region <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. The negative resist is then developed by a solvent wash of the photoresist layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to remove regions <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates block diagram <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> depicting a developed photoresist being subjected to an oxygen or nitrogen-containing atmosphere in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. Substrate <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> of diagram <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> contains a top layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of developed silicon-containing photoresist. The substrate <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is placed into an oxygen (O<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) containing or nitrogen (N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) containing atmosphere <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the oxygen or nitrogen-containing atmosphere is a plasma. The top photoresist layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of silicon-containing photoresist is exposed to the oxygen or nitrogen-containing atmosphere or plasma <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. For illustration purposes, the oxygen or nitrogen enriched atmosphere or plasma is depicted as arrows <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, the substrate <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is placed in a plasma enhanced oxygen or nitrogen enriched atmosphere. The flow rate of the oxygen or nitrogen-containing gases may be controlled through the etch chamber controls as will be described in reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. In still another embodiment of the invention, the nitrogen-containing atmosphere is maintained in the chamber through ammonia gas (NH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>) flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Continuing with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the oxygen or nitrogen atmosphere interacts with the top layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of the silicon-containing photoresist to form a hardened layer <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. It should be appreciated in the nitrogen atmosphere, the silicon of the silicon-containing atmosphere reacts with the nitrogen to form a layer <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> of silicon nitride (Si<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>N<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>or Si<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>N<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>). Similarly, while under an oxygen atmosphere, the silicon of the silicon-containing photoresist reacts with the oxygen to form a layer <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> of silicon dioxide (SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>). Accordingly, the silicon of the silicon-containing photoresist acts as a hardening agent and interacts with the oxygen or nitrogen-containing gas of the curing environment. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the top layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of silicon-containing photoresist has a thickness of about 2000 &angst; while the bottom layer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> of non silicon-containing photoresist has a thickness of about 6000 &angst;. In a general embodiment, the silicon-containing photoresist has a thickness that ranges between 1000 &angst; and about 3000 &angst;, while the bottom layer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> of non silicon-containing photoresist has a thickness that ranges between about 3000 &angst; and about 8000 &angst;. In another embodiment of the invention, the converted layer <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> has a thickness between about 5% to about 75% of the thickness of the original layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, where the hardened layer is silicon dioxide, the converted layer <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> is about 50% of the thickness of the original layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> As can be seen in diagram <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> the remainder of the top layer of the silicon-containing photoresist is unchanged as depicted by unconverted regions <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. In addition, regions <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> of the lower photoresist layer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> of non silicon-containing photoresist are exposed to the nitrogen or oxygen containing environment but are not converted because of the lack of silicon in the lower photoresist layer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. It should be appreciated that the conversion process may take place inside a chamber, such as an etch chamber which has a plurality of gas inlets. In such an embodiment the chamber is configured to control parameters, such as a flow rate of the oxygen or nitrogen containing gases and an inert gas such as argon, helium and xenon etc., a pressure inside the chamber, a temperature inside the chamber and the power of a top and bottom electrode. The preferred ranges for these parameters are discussed in reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. Just as significant, the use of an etch chamber allows for combining the different fabrication steps i.e., hardening the photoresist layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and downstream etching, in a single system, thereby increasing wafer throughput. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates block diagram <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> depicting an etched substrate having a post-etched hardened top layer <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> of a silicon-containing photoresist. Block diagram <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> displays etch profiles <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> which have been etched into substrate <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. It should be appreciated that either dry etch or wet etch processes can be used to create etch profile for via <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. As depicted by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the hardened layer <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> of the top layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of silicon-containing photoresist shows the effects of the etching process, where the thickness of the hardened layer <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> has been decreased through the etching process. In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, the etching process is part of a dual damascene process where the interlayer dielectric <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is etched down to copper metallization line <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. It should be appreciated that for a dual damascene process the etch may proceed through multiple dielectrics so that copper interconnect wiring may be formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> displays a via <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> etched through the dielectric to the copper metallization line <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. It can be appreciated that as devices further decrease in size, the aspect ratio of the vias, i.e., the ratio of the via depth to its width, increases. The higher aspect ratios require highly accurate etching to ensure device performance. As the aspect ratio increases the etching selectivity of the photoresists need to increase to adequately protect the underlying dielectric. While <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> demonstrates a portion of the hardened layer <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> remaining on the substrate <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, if the selectivity of the hardened layer of the was not increased through the invention described herein, then the etching process may etch through photoresist layers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> into the dielectric <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the further miniaturization of device features will continue to increase aspect ratios of the same features. As such, increasing the etching selectivity, as described herein, will ensure underlying layers are adequately protected during the etching process. While <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> depicts an etch of a via to the copper interconnects, it should be understood that hardened photoresist layer <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> is applicable for any type of dual damascene process including via first, trench first and self aligned processes </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Still referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, in accordance with one embodiment of the invention, the etch rate of the hardened layer <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> of the top layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of the silicon-containing photoresist relative to the etch rate of the non silicon-containing photoresist layer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> decreases. Likewise, the etch rate of the hardened layer <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> relative to the etch rate of the ILD <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> decreases. Accordingly, the selectivity ratio (S<highlight><subscript>r</subscript></highlight>), defined by the etch rate of the film undergoing the etch (E<highlight><subscript>f</subscript></highlight>) divided by the etch rate of the photoresist (E<highlight><subscript>r</subscript></highlight>), increases. The higher selectivity translates to the etching occurring on the desired layers, i.e., the material under the hardened layer <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> is shielded during etching as the etch rate of the hardened layer is smaller than the etch rate of the non silicon-containing photoresist <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> or the ILD <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, the selectivity ratio (S<highlight><subscript>r</subscript></highlight>) of a silicon dioxide hardened layer and the non silicon-containing photoresist is between about 8 and about 15. In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, the selectivity ratio (S<highlight><subscript>r</subscript></highlight>) of a silicon nitride hardened layer and the non silicon-containing photoresist is between about 6 and about 10. As further illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the hardened layer <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> effectively shields the layers below it. It should be appreciated that in this embodiment, even if the hardened layer is etched away completely during the etching process, the non silicon-containing layer is still available to shield the appropriate areas of the substrate from the etching process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates flowchart <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> depicting a method for increasing a silicon-containing photoresist selectivity in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. Flowchart <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> initializes with operation <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> where a substrate with a developed photoresist is provided. Here, the substrate may include one or more photoresists with the top photoresist being developed as discussed in reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, the developed photoresist is a silicon-containing photoresist. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Flowchart <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> then proceeds to operation <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> where the top photoresist layer is exposed to a curing environment. Here, the curing environment may be inside an etch chamber. Accordingly, the substrate will rest on a support within the chamber such as a chuck. In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, the curing environment is a oxygen or nitrogen-containing plasma. For example, an oxygen or nitrogen containing gas is introduced into the etch chamber through process gas inlets, thereby creating the curing environment when the plasma is struck. In a preferred embodiment, oxygen (O<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) is provided to the etch chamber to create the oxygen containing curing environment. Other oxygen containing gases that may be used include carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>), nitrous oxide (N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O) and nitrogen dioxide (NO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>). In another embodiment of the invention, the nitrogen containing gas is ammonia gas (NH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>). Other nitrogen containing gases that may be used include nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide (N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O) and nitrogen dioxide (NO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>). It should be further appreciated that the creation of the hardening layer may be initiated by striking a plasma within the etch chamber and controlling certain parameters inside the etch chamber as discussed below. In this embodiment, the gases would be introduced into the etch chamber along with an inert carrier gas such as argon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> As is well known in the art, etch chambers are capable of controlling various parameters. In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, the flow rate of the process gases, the pressure and temperature within the chamber, and the power to the top and bottom electrodes are controlled within the ranges that follow. It should be appreciated that the following ranges are provided for illustration purposes only. The flow rate for an oxygen containing gas, such as O<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, is between about 50 standard cubic centimeters per minute (sccm) and 500 sccm with a preferred flow rate of about 100 sccm. The flow rate for a nitrogen containing gas, such as ammonia gas NH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, is between about 100 sccm to 2000 sccm with a preferred flow rate of about 1000 sccm. The pressure within the chamber is controlled between about 50 millitorr (mT) and about 300 mT with a preferred pressure of about 150 mT. The temperature within the chamber is controlled between about &minus;30&deg; Celsius (C.) and about 70&deg; C. with a preferred temperature of about 0&deg; C. The power to the top electrode is between about 100 watts (W) and about 1500 W with a preferred power of 500 W. The power to the bottom electrode is between about 0 W to about 1000 W with a preferred power of 0 W. Finally, the flow rate of an inert gas, such as argon, is between about 300 sccm to about 1000 sccm with a preferred flow rate of 500 sccm. It should be appreciated that the above ranges may vary in different etch chambers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Returning back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, following operation <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> the method advances to operation <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, where a portion of the first photoresist layer is converted to a hardened layer. In a preferred embodiment of the invention when the curing environment is an oxygen-containing gas, the hardened layer is silicon dioxide (SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>). In another embodiment of the invention, where the curing environment is a nitrogen-containing gas, the hardened layer is silicon nitride (Si<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>N<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>or Si<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>N<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>). As mentioned previously, the oxygen or nitrogen-containing gas of the curing environment interacts with the hardening agent of the top photoresist layer to form a silicon dioxide or silicon nitride layer. In one embodiment of the invention the hardening agent of the top photoresist is silicon. Finally the method terminates with operation <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>, where an etch is performed using the hardened layer. Here, a via may be etched as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Alternatively, a trench may be etched and silicon containing photoresist applied and hardened, as described above, to define a region for etching a via. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> As described above in reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the hardened layer <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> has a thickness of about 50% of the original thickness of the silicon-containing photoresist layer. It should be appreciated that the hardened layer <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> of the substrate will improve the selectivity for future etching of the substrate <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. In other words, the selectivity of the hardened layer relative to the bottom photoresist layer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and the ILD <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is increased, thereby ensuring optimal critical dimension and profile control. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, where the hardened layer is silicon dioxide, the selectivity ratio between the hardened layer and the non silicon-containing photoresist or the ILD is between about 8 to about 15. In another embodiment of the invention, where the hardened layer is silicon nitride, the selectivity ratio between the hardened layer and the non silicon-containing photoresist or the ILD is between about 6 to about 10. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> It should be appreciated that the above described invention may be employed with a single silicon-containing photoresist layer is used without an underlying photoresist layer being applied to the substrate. Also, as mentioned above the invention may be utilized as part of a dual damascene process or traditional metallization processes where aluminum alloy forms the metal lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Although the foregoing invention has been described in some detail for purposes of clarity of understanding, it will be apparent that certain changes and modifications may be practiced within the scope of the appended claims. Accordingly, the present embodiments are to be considered as illustrative and not restrictive, and the invention is not to be limited to the details given herein, but may be modified within the scope and equivalents of the appended claims.</paragraph>
