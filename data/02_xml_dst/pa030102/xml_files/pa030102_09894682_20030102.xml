<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Technical Field </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates generally to wheeled carts and more particularly to a wheeled cart for transporting and storing horse saddles and other equipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Background of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Horse saddles are heavy, cumbersome pieces of equipment. The weight and shape of the saddles make it difficult to move them around with ease. When horse owners are involved with horse shows, they have a problem moving the saddles, bridles and other supplies from their trailers to the provided stalls. Space is at a premium at horse shows and consequently there is a problem storing the saddles and other tack in a place and manner which makes them conveniently available, yet out of the way </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Problems may also be experienced at an owner&apos;s stables where the area where tack is stored is some distance from the horse stall. A rider would therefore have to carry the saddles and bridles from the storage area to the stall&mdash;a tedious and tiring task. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A number of wheeled tack carts have been proposed in the prior art to assist horse owners in transporting their tack Some of the U.S. patent which have been granted for tack carts include U.S. Pat. No. 3,930,663 (Scripter); U.S. Pat. No. 5,338,049 (Goring), U.S. Pat. No. 5,474,312 (Starita et al) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,362,078 (Paton). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Scripter (U.S. Pat. No. 3,930,663) discloses a wheeled cart which is designed to transport one saddle at a time. When the user reaches their destination, a ground support is pivoted outwardly from the main frame to allow the cart to stand independently. The saddle is removed and the cart may be folded up for storage. This cart does not provide a way for transporting bridles or any other supplies unless they are draped over the saddle. Additionally, if the cart is used to transport a saddle to a stall where space is at a premium, such as at a horse show, the cart cannot be used to store the saddle efficiently as it takes up additional floor space in the stall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Goring (U.S. Pat. No. 5,338,049), discloses a tack cart which may be used to transport one saddle. The cart includes a storage box which can be used to transport bridles and other supplies. As with the cart proposed by Scripter, the Goring cart becomes a problem for temporarily storing tack in an area where space is tight. In fact the cart is more problematic in that it cannot be folded for storage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The cart proposed by Starita et al (U.S. Pat. No. 5,747,312), is also designed for the transportation of one saddle and it may be collapsed for storage. The cart is designed to carry a wide array of supplies. This device is however problematic when space is tight&mdash;it may be used to hold a saddle and supplies but takes up valuable floor space; or it can be folded away for storage - leaving nothing to hold the saddle and bridles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Finally, the cart proposed by Paton U.S. Pat. No. 95,362,078, is adapted to carry more than one saddle at a time and can be separated to form a saddle holding rack and a separate cart for transporting other supplies. This cart does not, however, address the problem with taking up valuable stall space while still providing a device for holding saddles and bridles. If the saddle holding rack is separated from the cart it still occupies floor space in the stall. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The tack cart, shown generally at <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, includes a base <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a first frame <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> attached to base <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a second frame <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> releasably attachable to first frame <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and at least one saddle support <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which is detachably receivable on either the first or second frame <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, base <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of tack cart <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is substantially rectangular having two parallel side bars <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and first and second end bars <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Wheels <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may be mounted to second end bar <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> so that cart <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be easily rolled from place to place. Leg <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> mounted on first end bar <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> prevents cart <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from accidentally rolling away when the cart is not in motion. The top of the leg <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is joined to function like a handle. Struts <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are provided between first and second end bars <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to strengthen base <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and to provide an additional support surface to hold articles carried on tack cart <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. While struts <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are shown as extending between first and second end bars <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, it is to be understood that they can also extend between side bars <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>or can take any other position or configuration which will either strengthen base <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or add support surface for carrying articles. The number and placement of both wheels <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and legs <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> may also be changed without departing from the scope of this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> First frame <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is substantially rectangular, having side rails <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and first and second end rails <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. First end rail <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> forms a handle for tack cart <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and may be slightly rounded. First ribs <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> extend between side rails <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. First ribs <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> may be of any suitable cross section to enable them to engage saddle supports <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. First frame <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is attached to base <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with brackets <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> which are secured to either struts <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> or side rails <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. A first nut <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and bolt <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are provided to releasably secure the second end rail <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to the second end bar. First nut <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> may be provided with an enlarged head so as to be easily handled by the user. When first nut <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is removed, first frame <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be pivoted into contact with base <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> so that cart <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be stored in a collapsed position (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Second frame <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is similar to first frame <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in appearance, having side posts <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and first and second end posts <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Second ribs <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> extend between side posts <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and are configured to receive saddle supports <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. At least one hook <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is provided to engage first frame <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. While hooks <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are shown engaged with second end post <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, they may be located in any other suitable position on second frame <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> so as to releasably hold first and second frames <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> together. Second nut <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and bolt <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> secure second frame <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to first frame <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. However, any other suitable securement mechanism may be employed such as a strap with a buckle, a strap with velcro, bungee cords, clips, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> At least one saddle support <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is receivable on either first ribs <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of first frame <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> or second ribs <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of second frame <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Any suitable mechanism may be used to engage the saddle supports on braces <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> or ribs <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, pairs of hooks <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may be provided to engage ribs <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> or ribs <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. A bridle support <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is also receivable over first ribs <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> or second ribs <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> for transporting bridles and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Tack cart <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention is used in the following manner: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> First frame <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and engaged second frame <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, are rotated away from base <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and are locked into the upright position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> by screwing nut <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> onto bolt <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. (Nut <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is provided with an enlarged handle so as to be easily manipulated by the user.) As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, without saddle supports <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> installed on first frame <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the tack cart <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be used to transport bales of hay and other articles (not shown). The bales are placed on base <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, resting on struts <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and against first frame <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> When it is desired to transport saddles and bridles, saddle supports <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are positioned on first ribs <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, bridle support <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is placed over first ribs <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Saddles <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> may then be placed onto saddle supports <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. When the user reaches the stall, second frame <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is detached from first frame <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by unscrewing the second nut <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and bolt <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. Hooks <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are disengaged from second end bar <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> so that second frame <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is independent of tack cart <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment shown (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>), second frame <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is rotated upside down through <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> degrees. In embodiments where hooks <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are not positioned in the manner shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, there may be no need to rotate second frame <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> once it is detached from first frame <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Hooks <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are used to releasably secure second frame <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to a suitable support such as a stall door or wall <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). Saddle supports <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are then attached to second frame <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> by engaging hooks <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> over second ribs <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 through 8</cross-reference>). Saddles <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> may then be positioned on the saddle supports <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Bridle support <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> may be positioned on either second frame <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> or directly onto stall wall <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. The saddles and other tack are therefore supported above the ground in a manner that allows for maximum utilization of space within the stall. The first frame <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be collapsed onto base <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> so that frame <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and base <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be stored away easily in a small space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> When it is time to leave the show, saddles <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> are removed from saddle supports <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, saddle supports <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are removed from second frame <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and are re-engaged with the first ribs <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>; second frame <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is rotated through 180 degrees (in the case of the embodiment shown) and is re-engaged with first frame <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The saddles are re-positioned on saddle supports <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the cart may be wheeled to the next desired location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In the foregoing description, certain terms have been used for brevity, clearness, and understanding; but no unnecessary limitations are to be implied therefrom beyond the requirement of the prior art, because such terms are used for descriptive purposes and are intended to be broadly construed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the description and illustration of the invention are by way of example, and the scope of the invention is not limited to the exact details shown or described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Having now described the features, discoveries, and principles of the invention, the manner in which the horse tack cart is constructed and used, the characteristics of the construction, and the advantageous new and useful results obtained; the new and useful structures, devices, elements, arrangements, parts, and combinations are set forth in the appended claims. </paragraph>
