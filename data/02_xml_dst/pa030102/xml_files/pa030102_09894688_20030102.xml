<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to the reduction of image defects in image processing and more specifically to a method for reducing image defects in a processed image attributable to the effect of backside image bleed through in two-sided documents. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Optical scanning and copying devices employ a method wherein data representative of a scanned object is produced by projecting an image of the scanned object onto an optical sensor. An image of the scanned object is projected onto an optical sensor by linear increment employing a moving scan line. The moving scan line is produced either by moving an image bearing media with respect to the scanner optical assembly or by moving the scanner optical assembly relative to an image bearing media. The optical sensor produces data representative of the intensity of the light projected thereon, i.e. data representative of the scanned image. Such stored data may be processed by a processing device to produce an image output or display. When photographic media is scanned to produce data representative of an image formed on that photographic media, the data may be further processed for output by an processing device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Scanning devices may include a media input, a media transport assembly and a media feed path for transporting documents to a scan position, such as a flatbed platen, or across a scanline. Optical scanning devices also include an imaging assembly including an array of photosensitive sensors, operable in successive sampling intervals for generating a plurality of linear samplings producing image data representative of the object being scanned. Scanning devices are known that include both one or two imaging assemblies. In the case of a scanning device including a single imaging assembly, a single side of an object may be scanned at a time. In the case of a scanning device including a pair of imaging assemblies, both sides of an object may be scanned simultaneously. A document including images on both the first and second sides may be scanned simultaneously while being advanced through a scan position by the media transport. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A scanning device may be configured as a duplex scanning device which permits the substantially simultaneous scanning of first and second sides of an image bearing media for first and second side image data. One problem encountered in duplex scanning is an effect referred to as &ldquo;bleed through&rdquo;. Second side imagery may be captured or acquired when scanning the first side of the image bearing media and similarly, first side imagery may be captured or acquired when scanning the second side of the image bearing media. Upon output, for example as a printed document, bleed through data may be evidenced as a loss or degradation of output quality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> One method for reducing the effect of bleed through is to reduce the opacity of the image bearing media. Another method for reducing the effect of bleed through in duplex scanning has been to offset the first and second or upper and lower imaging assemblies, particularly the illumination and photo sensing elements of the first and second imaging assemblies, to reduce the capture or acquisition of bleed through image data. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to an image processing method for enhancing scanned image output quality including the steps of scanning a first side of an image bearing media to acquire first side image data representative of a first side image. The second side of the image bearing media is scanned to acquire second side image data which is representative of a second side image. The method of the present invention employs the second side image data to enhance image output quality of the first side image data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Second side image data is mapped and utilized to reduce or eliminate first side bleed through data and distinguish first side bleed through data from first side image data. First side image data is compared to second side image data and first side bleed through data which coordinates with second side image data is subtracted from the image output data thereby enhancing image output quality of the first side image data and reducing image defects in a processed image attributable to the effect of image bleed through in two-sided documents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Similarly, first side image data is mapped and utilized to reduce or eliminate second side bleed through data and distinguish second side bleed through data from second side image data. Second side image data is compared to first side image data and second side bleed through data which coordinates with first side image data is subtracted from the image output data thereby enhancing image output quality of the second side image data and reducing image defects in a processed image attributable to the effect of image bleed through in two-sided documents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Mapping bleed through image data includes acquisition of opposing side image data and acquisition of data relating to the relative location of the opposing side image data. Once the bleed through image data is mapped, it is compared to primary image data. Data contained in the primary image data that corresponds to bleed through image data is removed from primary image data thereby enhancing image output data attributable to bleed through, image output data can be enhanced and the effects of bleed through minimized or eliminated.</paragraph>
