<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> When playing a conventional drum, such as a snare drum, it is desirable to make other sounds beside just the drumming sound caused by hitting the drum head. To achieve these other sounds, drummers hit the rim of the drums with the drum stick (a rim shot). This produces a different sound than the sound of the drum stick contacting the head of the drum, but the sound is relatively limited and somewhat metallic. Accordingly, it is desired that the drum be capable of producing a wider range of sounds. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>)-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>), shown therein is a first embodiment of the sounding block of the present invention. The sounding block of the present invention comprises a block <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which is generally rectangular when viewed from the front side and curved when viewed from the top side. The curvature <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the block <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is substantially the same as the curvature of the periphery of a drum to which the block <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is to be attached. Still further, the block <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may be made from solid woods, plywoods, resins, etc. The type of material from which the block <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is made and the size of the block will affect the sound produced when the block <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is struck by the drum stick. Particularly, the larger the block, the lower the sound. The block ranges in size from a height of approximately 57 mm to 114 mm, a thickness of 10 to 20 mm and the length of the block along the curvature <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is approximately 236 to 250 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The block <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is attached to a drum by means of attachment means. A typical attachment means would comprise elongated slots <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> formed in the block <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. A screw <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is provided which extends through an L-shaped bracket <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a washer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> made from a sound deadening materials such as rubber or felt, a metal washer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the slotted hole <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, a metal washer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and a wing nut <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> screwed onto the end of the screw <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The L-shaped bracket <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is further provided with a hole <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for attaching to a drum head tensioning screw of the drum. The sound deadening washer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is provided for the purpose of reducing the effects of vibration of the drum upon the sound of the block <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and vice-versa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> As is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the block <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is attached to the drum by means of inserting the drum head tensioning screw <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> through the hole <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with the rim <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the drum in between. Still further, depending upon the size and curvature of the drum <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and/or spacing of the drum head tensioning screws <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the wing nuts <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can be loosened and the screws <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> moved within the elongated holes <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> in the block <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Also, the block <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is mounted to the drum so that the top portion thereof projects above the top of the rim <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Typically, it projects above approximately 3 inch above the rim <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> After attachment to the drum <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a person playing the drum <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can either strike the rim <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the block <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or the rim <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the block <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> at the same time with the drum stick <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in addition to merely hitting the drum head <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> with the stick <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> all by itself. Such various hits will produce a variety of different sounds for the amusement of the drummer and his audience. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Referring to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>)-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>), shown therein is a second embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, those elements which are substantially the same as in the first embodiment are given a like reference numerals and perform the same function. However, this second embodiment is for the purpose of providing an additional sound for the sounding block which can be likened to a tambourine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> To provide the tambourine-like sound, a plurality of slots <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are provided in the block <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime;. Bells <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> such as one would find in a tambourine are provided in the slots <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and shaft <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are provided in the block <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; extending through the slots <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the bells <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Except for the addition of the bells <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> in the slots <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the sounding block of the block <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime;, the invention of the second embodiment performs substantially the same as the first embodiment. However, by striking the block with the drum stick <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> when the block <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; is attached to the drum <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a tambourine-like sound can be further produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, shown therein is the block <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the present invention attached to the outer circumference of the rim <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of a drum so as to be arranged at a cross-stick position so that the player <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is able to also produce cross-stick sounds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In order to produce cross-stick sounds, the player <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> holds the stick <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> with his thumb and point finger with the other fingers spread out on the drum head <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, thus forming a bridge. Then, player <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> raises the stick <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> with the butt end of the stick <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> that is positioned closest to the player <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> kept in touch with the drum head <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The player <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> then downs the stick <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> towards the rim <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The stick <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> as a result hits against the rim <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the block <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the present invention, producing the sounds of the rim <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and block <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> at the same time. With a metal rim <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and a wooden block <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, it is possible to produce a &ldquo;metallic&rdquo; and a &ldquo;woody&rdquo; sound simultaneously with the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In addition, it should be clear that by providing a drum with multiple blocks such as the first and second embodiments, additional options for a variety of sounds to be produced can be provided for the drummer and for the enjoyment of the audience. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> It should be apparent to those skilled in the art that the above-described embodiments are but a few of the many possible preferred embodiments which fall within the scope and content of the present invention. Numerous and various other arrangements can be readily devised by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. </paragraph>
