<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an implantable hernia repair prosthesis for reinforcing and repairing damaged tissue or muscle walls and methods for making same. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Various prosthetic mesh materials have been proposed to reinforce the abdominal wall and to close abdominal wall defects utilizing different repair prostheses and methods of installation. The methods of executing a surgical repair can be segregated into two main approaches. The repair can be made exclusively from the anterior side (closest to the surgeon) of the defect by dissecting the sac free of the fascia and pressing it back into the pre-peritoneal space and providing permanent closure of the defect. The closure can be provided through the application of space filling prostheses and overlay patches (tension-free techniques) or can be accomplished through the use of sutures (tension techniques). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> An example of a tension free anterior repair is to fold a sheet of surgical mesh fabric into a multi-layer cone configuration and then to insert the mesh plug into a hernia defect to occlude the void. Such a multi-layer prosthesis is inherently stiff, may not fully conform to variations in the contour of the defect, and is subject to shrinkage that potentially could lead to recurrent herniation. The stiff, multi-layered mesh plug also may be susceptible to kinking and buckling during placement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,356,432, discloses an implantable prosthesis that is a conical plug formed of a knitted polypropylene monofilament mesh fabric. Longitudinal pleats are hot molded into the mesh body to enhance the flexibility of the conical implant, ideally allowing the implant to closely match the contour of the herniated opening when compressed within the defect. When the device is installed into a fascial defect, the tip of the conical shaped plug presses into and against the visceral sac, potentially enabling long-term erosion of the peritoneum and underlying viscera. The device, in one embodiment, has filler material incorporated into the interior of the formed mesh cone in an attempt to minimize contraction of the device during healing. As collagen scar tissue grows into the prosthetic material, the cross linking of the maturing collagen fibers causes the scar tissue (and encapsulated plug device) to contract. This contraction of scar tissue within the defect and plug causes the surrounding diseased tissue to be subjected to tension, thus enabling re-occurrence of the hernia along the edge of the conical plug. The use of the device requires the passage of a pre-expanded plug through the hernia defect and relies upon the radial expansion force of the single layer mesh cone and filler leaves to occlude the defect. Additionally, since the plug is secured in position by anchoring to the surrounding diseased tissue, the device may dislodge and migrate within the pre-peritoneal space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, a defect may be repaired through the use of posterior approaches that provide various prosthetic devices in the pre-peritoneal space to prevent the peritoneum from entering the fascial defect. These devices, in some cases, require the use of laparoscopic techniques and, in other cases, require the application of the prosthesis from a remote location under the defect to be repaired. Examples of posterior approaches are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,116,357, 5,254,133 and 5,916,225. However, in many cases, procedures utilizing such devices are complicated, in addition to requiring the use of general anesthesia and costly disposable instrumentation to support the laparoscopic surgery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the prior art lacks an implantable hernia repair prosthesis for occluding and repairing damaged muscle and tissuewall ruptures, that is adaptable to irregularities in the shape of the defect, is simple to install, does not require the use of general anesthesia during installation and resists radial collapse due to tissue incorporation. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The limitations of prior art hernia prostheses are overcome by the present invention which includes a hernia repair prosthesis having an occlusive member for aiding in the occlusion of a defect in fascia tissue. The occlusive member is convertible from a first configuration with a first axial length and a first major radial extent to a second configuration with a second axial length and a second major radial extent. The second axial length is less than the first axial length and the second major radial extent is larger than the first major radial extent. The occlusive member has a pair of subsections, each having an apex and each flaring outwardly therefrom towards a terminal end. The apexes are disposed at opposite ends of the occlusive member with the terminal ends overlapping. The pair of subsections are conjoined proximate the overlapping terminal ends. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a method for forming the subsections, a surgical fabric is thermoset on a male die and may be stretched or heat shrunk to aid in conforming the surgical fabric to the contours of the male die.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides implantable prostheses for reinforcing and repairing weakened abdominal walls and methods for making such prostheses. The prostheses are formed of a biologically compatible, flexible and porous medical textile suitable for reinforcing tissue and occluding tissue defects. The implantable prostheses are indicated particularly for the repair of hernias in the abdominal cavity, including inguinal (direct and indirect), femoral, incisional and recurrent, and provide at least a partial posterior repair. The prostheses are able to be inserted easily in a stress-free condition into a fascia defect from an anterior approach and are capable of expanding radially, at least partially into the pre-peritoneal space, to substantially occlude and conform to the fascia wall of a fascia defect. Alternatively, a posterior approach may be used, if the surgeon prefers. The prostheses are suitable for the repair of varying sizes and shapes of hernias and can be anchored to the surrounding healthy tissue to prevent migration, thus extending beyond the edge of the defect on the anterior side of the defect. Other features of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description when taken in connection with the accompanying drawings that disclose multiple embodiments of the invention. The drawings are for the purpose of illustration only and are not intended as a definition of the limits of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The prostheses of the present invention comprise a hollow, radially-expandable member for placement within and occlusion of a fascia defect. By radially-expandable, it is meant that the cross sectional area of the member expands from an initial, non-expanded configuration having an initial cross sectional area, sized such that the member may be placed within a fascia defect in a stress-free condition, to a final, expanded configuration having a final cross sectional area greater than the initial cross sectional area and effective to occlude all of, or at least a substantial portion of, the fascia defect. This member can be manufactured out of biocompatible absorbable or non-absorbable surgical mesh material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> An exploded view of a prosthesis of the present invention is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Prosthesis <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises radially-expandable member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, having first and second conical members <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Each conical member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>has longitudinal pleats <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> terminating at apex <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and base <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of each conical member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, respectively. The number and spacial relationship of longitudinal pleats <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are effective to enhance the axial rigidity of the prosthesis <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> while being placed within the defect. Preferably, the pleats <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are thermoformed into the mesh body of each conical member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Conical member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>has a flange portion <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> that facilitates the relative alignment and attachment of conical members <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, as more fully described below in reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>. Looped suture <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, with a non-reversing knot <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, is passed through opposing conical members, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Overlay sheet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, e.g., formed from polypropylene surgical mesh, is fixedly attached to apex <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of one of opposing conical members <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>through the use of looped suture <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Overlay sheet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is utilized to attach and secure the prosthesis to the surrounding healthy tissue. Optionally, prosthesis <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may comprise one or more tubular structures <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, e.g., made from polypropylene surgical mesh and contained within cavity <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> within conical members <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Tubular structure <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> provides additional axial rigidity to the prosthesis during handling and insertion of the device into the defect. Tubular structure, as used herein, is meant to include those structures where the cross sectional configuration is tubular in nature. Tubular structure specifically includes cylindrical rolls of materials, e.g. meshes, where the cross section configuration is circular, as well as structures where the cross sectional configuration may be elliptical, triangular, rectangular, etc. The tubular structure <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> also improves the radial expandability of the prosthesis when it is compressed axially and the cylinder collapses, ensuring a solid expansion of the prosthesis against and below the tissue or wall structure defining the defect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Suture <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is passed through the opposing conical members <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, passing from the apex of one through the apex of the other. Suture <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> then is looped and returned back through the inner conical members <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in the opposite direction. Looped suture <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be passed through the tubular structure <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> axially (or through the ends of the tubular structure <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, perpendicular to the axis thereof, as shown by dotted line <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>&prime;) causing it to buckle, or collapse, when looped suture <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is constricted during use. In the particular embodiment illustrated, both ends of looped suture <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are passed through flat overlay sheet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Non-reversing knot <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is tied in looped suture <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and flat overlay sheet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is held in proximity to apex <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the upper one of the conical members <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The dead tail of the knot <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is trimmed to length. The finished prosthesis is subjected to sterilization prior to use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The assembled prosthesis of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Prosthesis <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be fabricated from any biocompatible medical woven, knitted or non-woven textile. In preferred embodiments, the prosthesis is fabricated from medical grade polypropylene mesh including knitted polypropylene monofilament mesh fabrics such as those available from Ethicon, Inc. under the Prolene trademark, as well as meshes available from Ethicon, Inc. under the Vicryl trademark. Other mesh materials useful in the invention include those available under the Marlex, Dacron, Teflon and Merselene trademarks. Alternatively, the desired effect of forcing tissue re-generation under the overlay patch can be accomplished through the selection of biocompatible absorbable materials for use in the fabrication of the expandable member. Examples of suitable materials are Vicryl and Panacryl sutures, available from Ethicon, Inc, and Polysorb suture, available from United States Surgical Corporation. Radially-expandable member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> comprises conical members <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>fixedly attached one to the other proximate respective bases <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Conical members <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are configured to have an initial, non-expanded, major diameter that is substantially the same size or less than the diameter of the defect to be repaired. While the conical members <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are (with the exception of flange <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>) shown in the figure to be identical in structure, embodiments in which one is taller than the other are contemplated by the invention. The conical members <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are positioned in opposition one to the other and bases <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are aligned by flange <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Once bases <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are aligned, conical members <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are fixedly attached to each other proximate the respective bases <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, e.g., in and around flange <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, as more fully described below. Bonding of the conical members <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>may be accomplished by stitching, gluing, welding or any other known form of attachment. Prosthesis <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes at least one flat sheet of mesh rolled into a tubular structure <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) and permanently located within cavity <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) formed by fixedly attached conical members <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Tubular structure <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> may be fabricated from a flat sheet of polypropylene mesh that, once rolled into cylindrical shape, can been secured about its circumference with suture. Alternatively, tubular structure <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> may be formed by rolling a flat sheet of mesh into the cylindrical configuration and welding, stitching or otherwise bonding the rolled sheet at the ends. Tubular structure <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) is disposed inside cavity <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) formed by fixedly attached opposing conical members <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and extends axially from the internal apex <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of one to the internal apex <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the other. Tubular structure <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> aids in providing axial rigidity to the prosthesis when it is inserted into the defect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, after hernia sac <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> has been dissected and/or ligated, prosthesis <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is inserted into fascia defect <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. Once hernia sac <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is free from walls <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of defect <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> in fascia <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, hernia sac <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is pressed back into the abdominal cavity. Apex <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the lower one of the conical members <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is inserted into defect <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, causing peritoneum <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to invert inwards into the abdominal cavity. Prosthesis <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is inserted until overlay sheet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is flush with anterior side <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of fascia <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Free end <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of suture <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is pulled while prosthesis <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is held in a forward position, i.e., flush with anterior side <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of fascia <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The tightening of suture <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> causes the opposing conical members <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to be drawn together. The compression of the conical members <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>causes them to collapse axially onto themselves, thus causing the diameter of conical members <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to expand radially and pleats <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to open up or expand into a relatively flattened position, i.e., with a greater major diameter and a lesser axial length. This same action causes tubular structure <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, located within cavity <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, to buckle, collapse and expand radially outward. Knot <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is pulled until it is fully tightened. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Free end <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of suture <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be provided with a needle to enable attachment of the prosthesis <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the surrounding healthy tissue by sewing overlay sheet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> into place. Alternatively, free end <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of suture <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be trimmed off after final deployment and the overlay patch can be attached in place through the use of additional sutures, or may remain in a flattened condition in the anterior space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The prosthesis <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is able to accommodate the spermatic cord structures since it is pleated. When it is expanded, it relies only on the radial expansion force generated from the compression of the opposing textile conical members <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to enlarge their diameters, as opposed to the use of additional semi-rigid rings or other rigid or semi-rigid members. Preferably, prostheses of the present invention do not comprise such rigid or semi-rigid devices. This ensures that the device is fully compliant to the natural anatomical structures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The final configuration of expanded prosthesis <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, both occludes fascia defect <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> on posterior side <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> and is expanded to fill the inner diameter of defect <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> in wall <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The expansion of radially expandable member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on posterior side <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> of defect <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> prevents peritoneum <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> from entering defect <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. Additionally, this posterior expansion ensures that the repair is secure from re-herniation through the defect, since the conical mesh is forced into a relatively flat condition. As the scar tissue grows into the flattened conical layers, it is compressed further in the axial direction by scar tissue contraction. With the inclusion of overlay patch <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, located on anterior side <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of defect <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, it is virtually impossible for the device to migrate either anteriorly or posteriorly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> While radial expansion of the member may be effected by means for radially-expanding the member as discussed and depicted herein, prostheses that are self-expanding, i.e. self-collapsing, when placed in position within the fascia defect are included within the scope of the present invention. Such devices may be constructed such that they will deploy, i.e. collapse axially and radially-expand to occlude the defect, when positioned within a defect in response to conditions of the body surrounding the defect </paragraph>

After the surgical mesh (<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) has been placed over the outer surface of the male die element <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, a mating female die (clamp) element <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is urged against the male die element <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to press the surgical mesh (<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) into the surface features of the male die element, i.e., the longitudinal valleys <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>&prime; and intervening land surfaces <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>&prime;, to impart the desired three dimensional shape to the mesh and to form the conical member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The female die element <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> may be formed from a plurality of individual blade elements <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, preferably removably or hingedly attached to a common hub or pivot point and having an open configuration (shown in dotted lines) and which fold together to a closed configuration to press into the longitudinal valleys <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>&prime;. The conical member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>clamped by blade elements <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may then be heated to impose a set on the surgical mesh <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>such that it will retain the die shape after cooling and removal from the die set <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>.

In contrast to the preceding expandable member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, wherein two substantially identical conical members <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> were held in alignment and then secured together in opposition at the bases <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the cone shape, i.e., by gluing, stitching or welding at the flange <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, conical member <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is attenuated such that it does not extend all the way to base line <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. As before, the conical members <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are self aligning for the purpose of assembly. Conical member <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>has a conical portion <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> extending from the apex <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to a base line <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Base line <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> represents a redirection of the surgical mesh and a great diameter of the conical member <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the expandable member <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> as a whole. A flange portion <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> of the conical member <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>extends from the base line <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and converges toward apex <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, mimicking the shape of the conical portion <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> in reverse or mirror image.

The extent of conical members <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>can be varied to provide greater or lesser overlap.

Alternatively, conical member <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>can have a lesser extent than conical member <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, as shown, such that there is a single layer of material present at the base line <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, which promotes bending at the baseline <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and radial expansion of the expandable member <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The manufacture of the radially expandable member <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> calls for the formation of the conical members <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and their subsequent assemblage. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> diagrammatically shows a die system that can be employed to form the conical member <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, which includes a male die element <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> with conical portion <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and conical flange portion <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. A female die element <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> has a plurality of moveable blade elements <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, each having a conical portion <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a conical flange portion <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>for engaging the conical portion <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and conical flange portion <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, respectively, of the male die element <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>.

The blade elements <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> may be pivotally secured to the base <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> or, as shown, are removably retained in complementary shaped slots <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight> and clamped in a closed position by flange <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>.

An orientation pin <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> may be utilized to position the mesh material in the forming station to achieve a selected orientation of the wales, warps, wefts, etc, promoting distortion-free forming of the material as the blade elements <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> are urged into position clamping the material against the male die <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. Optimal forming may require a particular sequential order of clamping the blade elements <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, depending upon the material, e.g., <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> While the surgical mesh used to form the conical member <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may be cut or otherwise formed in any selected two dimensional shape, a disk shape may be used to illustrate the relationship between the respective surface areas of the surgical mesh material <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the male die element <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. More specifically, for a male die element <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> having a conical portion <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>with a given altitude A and base B, the surface area thereof has two components, viz., that attributable to the surface area of the lands <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>&prime; and that attributable to the surface area of the longitudinal valleys <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>&prime;. Since the width of the valleys <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>&prime; of the die <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> directly decreases the land <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>&prime; area of the die <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, the total surface area may be controlled by varying the depth and shape of the longitudinal valleys <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>&prime;, which can be selected to &ldquo;use&rdquo; a desired amount of the surface area of the surgical mesh <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Similarly, the longitudinal valleys <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>&Prime; in the conical flange portion <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the male die element <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> may have a selected depth, shape etc. such that the surface area of the flange portion <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>may be altered by varying these dimensions. The valley <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>&prime; dimensions for the conical portion <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may be different than the valley <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>&Prime; dimensions of the conical flange portion <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Alternatively, the valley <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>&Prime; dimensions may be consistent and symmetrical. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The foregoing observations concerning the surface areas of the conical portion <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and conical flange portion <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are noteworthy in that a given disk-shaped sample of surgical mesh has a surface area that increases radially in accordance with the relationship (&pgr;r<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>). The surface of a cone increases from the apex <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> to the base <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> in accordance with the relationship &pgr;rs; where s&equals;(r<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&plus;b<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>)<highlight><superscript>&frac12;</superscript></highlight>. As a consequence, the area of the material disk increases along its radius, as does the area of the conic portion <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>from the apex to the base. Any mismatch of surface areas must be accounted for by stretching the mesh. The flange portion <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the male die element <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> exhibits a departure from the surface area of the material disk, in that while the converging flange portion <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the die <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> increases the total surface area, it does so at a decreasing rate (due to its convergence) at the same time that surface area of the mesh <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>increases by the square of the radius. Accordingly, after the surgical mesh material extends beyond the great diameter of the male die <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> (at base B) and starts to cover the converging conical flange portion <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the die <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, an excess of mesh material must be accounted for in order to bring the mesh into conformance with the die <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a first approach, the die <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is formed with a valley <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>&Prime; number (frequency) and depth (magnitude) such that the surface area of the mesh material <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>matches that of the flange <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>but is less than that required to cover the surface area of the conical portion <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>(including the surface area of the valleys <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>&prime;) proximate to the great diameter at base B without stretching. In accordance with this method, the surgical mesh material <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is wrapped over the male die element <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> covering both the conical portion <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the conical flange portion <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the die <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. The female die element <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> is then clamped over the male die element <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> forcing the mesh material <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>into the valleys <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>&Prime; provided in the male die element <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. Because the surface area of the material <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is less than that of the die <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, the material <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>will be stretched thinner in the areas where the surface areas of the material <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the die <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> do not match. This results in the mesh <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>being thinner and more porous in those areas where it is stretched, primarily in the area of the great diameter proximate base B. This thinning in the area of the base B of the conical portion <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>enhances the hinge effect present at baseline <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of the expandable member <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, promoting the expansion of the expandable member <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Once the mesh has been conformed to the surfaces of the complementary die elements <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>, the mesh is heated, e.g., by convection, radiation and/or conduction through the die elements <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>. Heating relieves the stress in the highly oriented, drawn fibers of the surgical mesh <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>allowing the mesh to permanently set in the shape imposed upon it by the dies <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>. The female die <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> can then be removed and the mesh cooled prior to removal from the male die <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. In using the foregoing technique, the mesh <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>must be securely held against the male die element <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> to prevent it from creeping along the surface of die <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> prior to its being clamped tightly by the female die element <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>. The same process may be undertaken to form conical member <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. If the extent of <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is chosen such that no flange <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> is present (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>) the foregoing considerations concerning matching the respective surface areas of the mesh <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the male die <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> are simplified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> An alternative approach for forming conical member <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is to use a male die <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> with a surface area less than that of the surgical mesh <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, in particular, in the area of the flange portion <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the die <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. The mesh <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is clamped to the male die element <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> such that there is an excess of mesh material <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>distributed in the valleys <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>&Prime; of the die <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. The mesh <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is then heated by convection to an elevated temperature, causing the fibers of the mesh <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to stress relieve and to shrink. The shrinkage of the mesh <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>causes the surface area of the mesh to be reduced through a localized reduction in porosity in the conical flange portion <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>. This method does not involve the same forces that induce the slippage of mesh on the face of the male die <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and eliminates the excess mesh material that might otherwise result in irregularities in the finished conical element <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, such as everted pleats. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> As can be appreciated from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>, the finished conical elements <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>nest together in natural alignment due to the alignment of the pleats <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and lands <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>. Having thus been aligned, the overlap between <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>can be joined by a variety of conventional means including adhesives or welding. One advantageous method includes utilizing a plurality of metal pins <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) to form a backing cage for the overlap area of <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>during exposure to ultrasonic welding. While only one pin <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> is shown, it should be appreciated that a series of pins <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> would be used to provide multiple ultrasonic welds around the circumference of the expandable element <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> As yet another approach to forming the expandible element <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, internal stiffening ribs can be formed within the pleats <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> through the controlled application of heat and clamping the mesh in the dies <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>, viz., by differential shrinkage of the mesh to form stiffening ribs. More specifically, a mesh disk is provided having a greater surface area than that of the male die <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, i.e., if the mesh <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>were pressed against the surface of the male die <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> (including the lands <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>&Prime; and valleys <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>&Prime;) there would be excess mesh <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, particularly in the flange area <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the die <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. The mesh <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is applied over a cold male die element <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. A female die <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> having independently moveable blade elements <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> for abutting against the land areas <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>&prime;. <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>&Prime; of the male die <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and independently moveable portions for abutting against the valleys <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>&Prime; in the male die <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is applied over the mesh <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to clamp the land areas <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> only. This leaves the pleats <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> free to assume any position relative to the valley areas <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>&Prime; of the male die <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. In practice, the unclamped pleats <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> tend to bulge out from the surface of the male die <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. The unclamped pleats <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> are subject to heating to a point that the exposed mesh undergoes shrinkage. The die itself is cool and the lands <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> of the mesh that are clamped in the die are shielded from heating. The heating may be done by convection, radiation (heat lamp) or other conventional methods. While the mesh <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is still hot, the moveable portions of the female die <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> that correspond to the pleats <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, i.e., that insert into the valleys <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>&Prime; of the male die <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, are applied to the mesh <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to clamp the exposed hot pleats <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> into the valleys <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>&Prime; of the male die <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. The female die <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> is dimensioned relative to the male die <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> to produce a selected thickness for the mesh material in each area, i.e., in the land areas <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> and the pleat areas <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. The heat source is removed and the mesh <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is allowed to cool while clamped in the die to retain its set shape. Because the pleats <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> were exposed to heating and experienced shrinkage, the density of the pleats <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is greater (lower porosity) than the lands <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>. When conical elements <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>formed in this manner are mounted together in opposition, as explained above, the high density regions of the mesh, i.e., the pleats <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, act as stiffening ribs. When the radially expandable member <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is axially collapsed, the higher density and more rigid pleats <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> resist bending and force the lands <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> apart to deploy the radially expandable member <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The same concept for forming stiffened, higher density regions in the conical members <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>described above can be generally applied to surgical mesh to form mesh products with selected stiffened regions. More particularly, by clamping certain regions of the mesh in a cold die with other slack portions subject to heating and shrinkage, zones of higher density/greater rigidity of any devised shape or distribution can be formed. </paragraph>

The radially expandable element <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> has conical portion <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>with a flange (shown by dotted line <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight>) that is covered by conical portion <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, which extends to baseline <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. As in the previous embodiment, the filament <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> is joined to the overlay patch <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> at two spaced points <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight>, e.g., by tying, plastic welding or by being restrained from pulling through the overlay patch <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> material by knots or enlarged ends that exceed the size of the pores of the material of the overlay patch <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Because the expandable member <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is slidable on the filament <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, the expandable member <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> may be positioned relative to the overlay patch <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> to maximally conform to the anatomy of the patient and the surgical repair encountered, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. More particularly, the expandable member <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> may be inserted into the facia void and then the position of the overlay patch <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> may be adjusted to coincide with the position of maximally effective surgical attachment, viz., to be amenable to attaching the overlay patch <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> to healthy tissue, to bridge over weak, unhealthy tissue, and also to conform to the patients&apos; local anatomical shape.
