(U.S.) if the coupon is valid $54. (U.S.) if coupon has expired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Preliminary Appraisal free if coupon is still valid, $45. if coupon has expored. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> &num;1 He is the catcher he goes to the pitcher&apos;s position, &num;2 he is the pitcher he goes to the batter&apos;s position, &num;3 he is the batter he goes to the catcher&apos;s position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The purpose of the game is to knock down the cans with the ball only, not with the bat or with your hands. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The game COON CANS need 3 players, 6 cans, 2 bases, one bat, and one ball. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The pitcher or the catcher knocks down the cans with the ball, and when he knock down the cans with the ball he must say coon cans, because if he don&apos;t say coon cans the batter gets the point (One Point). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Lets call the player &num;1 Tom, player &num;2 Dick, and player &num;3 Larry.

<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Tom and Dick stands behind their cans with their feet on their bases.

<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Dick the pitcher have the ball in his hand, he rolls the ball very, very hard to try to known down Toms cans, but Larry hits the ball and stop dick fromknocking down Toms cans, the ball knock down Dicks cans instead. When Larry hit the ball and knock down Dick&apos;s cans Larry must say coon cans.

<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> If Larry, instead of hitting Dick&apos;s cans with the ball, hit the ball 25 or 30 feet away (accidently, because the purpose of the game is to k nock down the cans) from Dick&apos;s cans to the left or the right, Larry then runs to step on Dick&apos;s base while Dick is getting the ball, then he runs back to Toms base and stop on it, that&apos;s one point for Larry. If Larry can go and step on Dick&apos;s base again and back to Tome&apos;s base that&apos;s two points. 10 points game is over. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> But, if Larry only makes on epoint, and while he&apos;s running back to Tom&apos;s base from trying to make 2 points, and Dick pitches the ball to Tom, and Tom catches, the ball and knowck the cans down with the ball Larry is out with one point. (Rotate). </paragraph>

If Larry does this 3 times in a row he&apos;s out. (Rotate). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> If Dick pitches the ball while Larry is running and knock down Tom&apos;s cans or his cans, and say coon cans, the game is over. (Rotate). </paragraph>
