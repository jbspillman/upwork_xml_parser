<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a process for semiconductor devices and more particularly to a process for integrating light energy transmit and/or receive functions with existing semiconductor devices, such as GaAs or InP devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Various semiconductors are known, such as high-electron mobility transistor (HEMT) and heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) active devices as well as light-emitting devices, such as laser diodes, in which it is necessary to monitor performance of the device during operation. For example, for light-emitting devices, such as lasers, performance is normally monitored by way of a photodetector. The photodetector is used to monitor the intensity of the light indicating device. Such photodetectors are known to be fabricated separately and epoxied directly to the light-emitting device. However, such a process is relatively inefficient since it requires separate processing of the photodetector and also requires attaching of the photodetector to the semiconductor device. Such an inefficient process thus increases the cost of devices which require monitoring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> As such, processes have been developed for integrating photodetectors into a light emitting device, such as a laser, for example, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,757,837 and 6,023,485. However, the integration of the photodetectors into the light-emitting devices as disclosed in these patents involves relatively complicated processes and only provides limited performance. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,757,834 discloses a vertical cavity surface emitting laser with an integrally formed photodetector. The photodetector is formed as an intracavity quantum well photodetector, disposed at the optical intensity peak at the Fabry-Perot wavelength. In particular, the laser is formed on a GaN substrate and includes an n-doped distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) mirror stack. An active gain region is formed on top of the n-doped DBR mirror stack and includes a one wavelength spacer and a quantum well stack. A p-doped DBR mirror stack is formed on top of the active gain region. The intracavity quantum well photodetector is formed on top of the p-doped DBR mirror stack and includes a 5&lgr;/4 spacer with an In<highlight><subscript>0.2 </subscript></highlight>Ga<highlight><subscript>0.8</subscript></highlight>As quantum well. On top of the photodetector another n-doped DBR mirror stack is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The laser emits light from the underside of the GaAn substrate. Reflected light is sensed by the photodetector to provide an indication of the intensity of the laser light. Although the system disclosed in the &apos;837 patent discloses an integrally-formed photodetector, the processing steps are rather complicated and include the formation of a quantum well sandwiched between two DBRs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 6,023,485 also discloses a vertical cavity surface emitting laser diode with an integrated PIN photo diode. In this embodiment, the PIN diode is formed on top of a vertical cavity surface emitting laser. The PIN diode is formed as a lower stack of n-doped DBRs, which are shared with the laser. An intrinsic region and p-doped upper stack of DBRs are formed on top of the PIN diode. Ion implantation is used to damage a portion of the upper stack of DBRs in order to define high resistivity damaged areas to confine the light paths in the region of the upper stack of DBRs. As such, the device is relatively complicated to fabricate. Thus, there is a need for a monitoring device that can be integrated with various active devices that is relatively simpler to fabricate than known devices. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a relatively uncomplicated process for forming one or more monitoring device, such as amorphorous silicon transmit and receive structures on top of active devices, such GaAs, GaN, and InP or related devices, as well as light-emitting devices, such as lasers. An important aspect of the invention is that the light transmit and receive functions can be implemented by way of a relatively simple low-temperature, of amorphous silicon composition deposition process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, the light energy transmit and receive functions can be integrated on top of active devices, such as GaAs, GaN and InP active, devices, for example, as disclosed in commonly-owned U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,838,031; 5,710,523; 5,550,520; 5,398,004; 5,389,896 and 5,355,096. In particular, the light energy transmit function may be integrally incorporated into a GaAs, GaN or InP active device, such as an amplifier, which would allow visual inspection of the operation of the amplifier connected to the light emitting diode. On the other hand, the light energy receive function may be used to detect light, for example, from light-emitting devices, such as lasers and laser diodes, for example as disclosed in commonly-owned U.S. Pat. No. 5,038,356, to monitor the light intensity of the light-emitting device to provide an indication of the performance light-emitting device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The present invention is shown and illustrated as being integrated on top of a semiconductor laser diode and more particularly to a vertical cavity surface emitting diode laser (VCSEL), as described in detail in commonly-owned U.S. Pat. No. 5,038,356, hereby incorporated by reference. It is to be understood, however, that the integration process in accordance with the present invention may be utilized with virtually any GaAs or InP active devices, as well as various types of light-emitting devices, to provide additional functionality on a single GaAs, or InP substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Turning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the silicon process for forming a light transmitting or light receiving device is shown being formed on top of a vertical cavity surface emitting diode laser described in detail in commonly-owned U.S. Pat. No. 5,038,356, hereby incorporated by reference. Briefly, the VCSEL, generally identified with the reference numeral <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, may be formed by a two-step metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) crystal growth process or by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). As shown, the VCSEL includes a substrate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, for example, a p-doped InP, GaAs or other substrate. A p-doped semiconductor reflector or distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is formed on top of the substrate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. A p-cladding layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is next formed on top of the semiconductor reflector layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The p-cladding layer may be formed of Al<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>As<highlight><subscript>1-x</subscript></highlight>. An active layer, formed, for example, from multiple quantum wells, may be disposed between the p-cladding layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and an n-cladding layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. A back reflector layer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may be formed on top of the n-cladding layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The front reflector <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may be distributive Bragg reflector formed from 5 to 10 high/low index pairs for example, or a certain number of pair depending on the light wavelength. The back reflector <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may be formed from 70 to 100 high/low index pairs for example, or a certain number of pair depending on the light wavelength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Unlike the VCSEL disclosed in commonly-owned U.S. Pat. No. 5,038,356, the back reflector layer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is not formed as a mesa. Rather the back reflector layer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is allowed to extend across the surface of the entire device, as generally shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The balance of the details for forming the vertical cavity surface emitting diode laser are as generally disclosed in commonly-owned U.S. Pat. No. 5,038,356. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In accordance with an important aspect of the invention, a relatively low temperature, i.e. 250&deg; C.-550&deg; C., silicon dioxide or silicon nitride passivation layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is formed on top of the VCSEL <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD). A window <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) is etched through passivation layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to enable the photodetector to detect reflected light, as will be discussed in more detail below. The window <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may be formed by masking the window <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> by standard photolithographic techniques and dry etching to remove that portion of the passivation layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to form the window <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The dry etching may be followed up by a wet etch process to clean passivation material residue from the upper reflector layer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> After the window <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is formed in the passivation layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, the photodetector is formed thereupon. The photodetector may be implemented as a standard solar cell growth process. In particular, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> p-type conductive transparency oxide <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> (CTO) formed from, for example, ZnO having a thickness of, for example, 150 nm is formed on top of the passivation layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and window <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Another silicon dioxide layer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be formed on top of the CTO layer <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The silicon dioxide layer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be formed with a thickness of thousand angstroms. A second CTO layer (SnO) Tin Oxide with fluor doped <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is formed on top of the silicon dioxide layer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> from ZnO having a thickness of 150 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> A p-doped amorphorous silicon material composition layer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is formed on top of the second CTO layer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The p-doped amorphorous silicon material composition may be formed with a thickness of 10-20 nm. An un-doped amorphorous silicon absorbent layer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is sandwiched between the p-doped amorphorous silicon material composition layer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and an n-doped amorphorous silicon composition layer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The un-doped amorphorous silicon absorbent layer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> may be formed with a thickness between 200 nm-300 nm. The n-doped amorphorous silicon composition layer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> may be formed with a thickness of 100 nm-150 nm. Finally, a third CTO layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may be formed on top of the n-doped amorphorous silicon composition layer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The third CTO layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is formed from ZnO having a thickness of, for example, 150 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Turning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the next processing level relates to depositing an n-contact metal <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> for the photodetector contact on top of the third CTO layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The n-contact metal <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is deposited and lifted off by standard photolithography and metal deposition techniques to form an n-contact for the photodetector. After the n contact <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is formed, the photodetector is formed as a mesa using standard semiconductor processing techniques, for example, and etching through layer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> up to layer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. After the mesa <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is formed, a photodetector p-type contact <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is formed by conventional semiconductor processing techniques to form the metallization pattern <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. Subsequently, a p-metal is deposited and lifted off to form the metallization pattern <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> for the photodetector p-contact. Subsequently, an n-VCSEL metallization pattern <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is formed. The metallization pattern <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is formed by etching through the layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and depositing and lifting of an n-type metal TiPtAu by conventional techniques, forming an integrated device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The device may then be mounted upside down to a carrier <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, for example, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,038,356. Subsequently, the substrate layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be lapped and polished to the desired thickness, for example, 75-100 microns. A window <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> may be formed in the bottom of the substrate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> by standard photolithography and etching techniques. After the window <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is formed, a p-type VCSEL contact (not shown) may be formed within the window to contact the layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> by standard lithography techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> An exemplar integrated device is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> and identified with the reference numeral <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. As indicated in U.S. Pat. No. 5,038,356, the laser emits light in a direction generally perpendicular to the planar layers of the device out the window <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, as generally indicated by the arrow <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. The photodetector, generally identified with the reference numeral <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, receives leakage light back through the top reflective stack <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and window <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, which, in turn, is absorbed into the detector <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> to provide an indication of the operation of the VCSEL integrally formed therewith. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Obviously, many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. For example, various known photodetectors and photodiodes may be formed on top of the active or light emitting device to provide an integrated device with additional functionality in accordance with present invention. Thus, it is to be understood that, within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described above. </paragraph>
