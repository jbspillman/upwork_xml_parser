<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to image data processing and more specifically to a method for enhancing image output quality by scanning a second side of an image bearing media to acquire data relating to the manufacture of the image bearing media. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Optical scanning and copying devices employ a method wherein data representative of a scanned object is produced by projecting an image of the scanned object onto an optical sensor. An image of the scanned object is projected onto an optical sensor by linear increment employing a moving scan line. The moving scan line is produced either by moving an image bearing media with respect to the scanner optical assembly or by moving the scanner optical assembly relative to an image bearing media. The optical sensor produces data representative of the intensity of the light projected thereon, i.e. data representative of the scanned image. Such stored data may be processed by a processing device to produce an image output or display. When photographic media is scanned to produce data representative of an image formed on that photographic media, the data may be further processed for output by an processing device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Scanning devices may include a media input, a media transport and a media feed path for transporting documents to a scan position, such as a flatbed platen, or across a scanline. Optical scanning devices also include an imaging assembly including an array of photosensitive sensors, operable in successive sampling intervals for generating a plurality of linear samplings producing image data representative of the object being scanned. Scanning devices are known that include both one or two imaging assemblies. In the case of a scanning device including a single imaging assembly, a single side of an object may be scanned at a time. In the case of a scanning device including a pair of imaging assemblies, both sides of an object may be scanned simultaneously. A document including images on both the first and second sides may be scanned simultaneously while being advanced through a scan position by the media transport. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Manufacturers of various image bearing media or media for image reproduction may include product data, that is information that relates to the identity of the manufacturer of the media, the source of the media or properties of the media itself including the manufacturer&apos;s dye set. There may be advantage in providing a method for scanning an image bearing media to acquire product data, the product data being utilized by a processing device to enhance image data for output. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to a method for enhancing image output quality including the steps of scanning a first side of an image bearing media for acquiring data representative of a first side image and scanning a second side of the image bearing media to acquire specified or product data, that is data relating to manufacture of the image bearing media. Particularly, product data may include any information relating to manufacture of the image bearing media identity including the identity of the manufacturer of the media, the source of the media or properties of the media itself including the dye set employed by any given manufacturer. Product information may include any information that directly or indirectly relates to the media that may be utilized to affect processing of image data. For instance, information may indirectly relate to the dye set employed by any given manufacturer to the extent that a manufacturer places any identifying information on the second side of the image bearing media. A processing device may reference a library of manufacturer product data to determine media properties and characteristics including the dye set employed by any given manufacturer. Alternately, information may be obtained that directly relates to the dye set employed by any given manufacturer to the extent that a manufacturer may include such information on the second side of the image bearing media. Regardless of the manner in which product data is obtained, the information, once obtained is utilized by a processing device to provide image enhancement and to optimize output image quality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In one preferred embodiment of the invention, a document including images on both the first and second sides is scanned, both sides in a substantially simultaneous scanning interval while being advanced through a scan position by the media transport. A pair of imaging assemblies are arranged adjacent to and on either side of the document path. The pair of imaging assemblies are arranged such that documents bearing an image on one or both sides may be transported along a sheet path permitting scanning and data acquisition from both sides of the document in a substantially simultaneous time frame or interval. The first imaging assembly produces data representative of the media first side scanned image and the second imaging assembly produces data representative of the media second side scanned image, including any product data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The scanning device and method of the present invention provides image data processing which may enhance the quality of a reproduction of an image by obtaining product data and employing such information, including the dye set employed by any given manufacturer, to enhance image data. The scanning device and method of the present invention may also provide an image processing which may enhance the accuracy of color reproduction of a film image by obtaining product data and employing such information, including the dye set employed by any given manufacturer, to enhance image data.</paragraph>
