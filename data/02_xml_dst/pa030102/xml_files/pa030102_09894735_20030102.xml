<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention concerns a novel method and apparatus for placing a medical agent into a vessel of the body, and in particular concerns a novel method for placing embolic coils within an aneurysm of the brain. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The use of embolic coils placed within an aneurysm for treating the aneurysm within the brain is well known. Various devices are known for delivering embolic coils through the patient&apos;s vessel to the aneurysm. Typically these embolic coils, which generally take the form of helically wound coils, or random wound coils, are carried by a coil deployment device which serves to introduce the coils into the aneurysm. The coils are then released by the coil deployment device using one of various types of release mechanisms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> An example of such a coil deployment device is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,113,622 entitled, &ldquo;Embolic Coil Hydraulic Deployment System&rdquo;, issued Sept. 5, 2000 and assigned to the same assignee as the present patent application. The disclosure of this patent is incorporated herein and made a part of this application. It has been found to be difficult to place these coils in the exact desired position because of the relative lack of stability of the deployment device within the vessel during the introduction of the embolic coil to an aneurysm. An example of a delivery system used to stabilize a coil deployment device is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/878,530, entitled &ldquo;Delivery System Using Balloon Catheter&rdquo;, filed Jun. 11, 2001 and assigned to the same assignee as the present patent application. The disclosure in this patent application is incorporated by reference and is made a part of the subject patent application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is, therefore, an object of this invention to provide a method for placing embolic coils in a relatively precise manner by the use of a stabilizing delivery catheter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for placing embolic coils within an aneurysm of the brain, which system is relatively simple in use for the physician. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A further object of the present invention is to provide a method for delivering medical agents such as diagnostic or therapeutic agents, and other medical agents by the use of a delivery catheter in a relatively simple, efficient and stable manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A still further object is to provide a delivery catheter which enables the delivery of embolic coils within an aneurysm in a relatively simple, efficient and stable manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide a delivery catheter which may be utilized to deliver embolics, diagnostic, and therapeutic agents by way of a delivery lumen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A further object of the present invention is to provide a delivery catheter that is relatively simple in construction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Other objects of the present invention will become apparent from the following description. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for placing an embolic coil into an aneurysm, such as an aneurysm within the brain, by use of a delivery catheter. The delivery catheter includes a first lumen and a second lumen with a side opening which extends positioned generally proximal to the distal end of the catheter. The delivery catheter also includes a puller wire which extends through the first lumen and is fixedly attached to the delivery catheter at a location proximal to the distal end of the catheter. The method comprises the steps of introducing the delivery catheter into the vessel of a patient over a guidewire. The guidewire extends through the second lumen and serves to generally align the side opening with the aneurysm. The method also includes the steps of withdrawing the guidewire, pulling the proximal end of the puller wire to cause the delivery catheter to deflect, or bow, at a location proximal to the side opening to thereby cause the side opening to move in a position adjacent to the aneurysm, introducing an embolic coil deployment device into the delivery catheter through the second lumen and then through the side opening into the aneurysm, delivering an embolic coil into the aneurysm, withdrawing the embolic coil deployment device from the delivery catheter, releasing the proximal end of the puller wire to permit the catheter to straighten, and thereafter withdrawing the delivery catheter from the vessel of the patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for placing a medical agent, which may take the form for example of a diagnostic or therapeutic device, or a liquid embolic material, or an embolic coil, at a preselected position within a vessel of the body. The method utilizes a delivery catheter having a first and second lumen and a side opening in the second lumen proximal the distal end of the catheter. Also the catheter includes a puller wire which extends through the first lumen and is fixedly attached to the delivery catheter at a location proximal to the distal end of the catheter. The method comprises the steps of pre-loading the delivery catheter with a guidewire by placing the guidewire into the second lumen, thereafter introducing the catheter into the vessel of a patient to generally align the side opening of the catheter at a preselected position within the vessel, pulling the proximal end of the puller wire to cause the catheter to deflect, or bow, at the preselected position within the vessel to thereby stabilize the catheter within the vessel, withdrawing the guidewire, introducing a deployment device for carrying the medical agent into the second lumen of the delivery catheter and through the side opening to deliver the medical agent at the preselected position, releasing the proximal end of the puller wire to permit the delivery catheter to become straighten, and thereafter withdrawing the delivery catheter from the vessel of the patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In accordance with other embodiments of the present invention, the method may include delivery of a medical agent which takes the form of a diagnostic or therapeutic agent, an embolic coil, or other medicament. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In accordance with still another embodiment of the invention, the method includes the use of a hydraulic deployment system for delivering an embolic coil through a delivery catheter to an aneurysm. The hydraulic deployment device includes a positioning catheter having a distal tip for retaining the embolic coil. When the positioning catheter is pressurized with a fluid, the distal tip of the positioning catheter expands outwardly to release the coil at the preselected position within the aneurysm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another aspect of the present invention there is provided an apparatus for placing an embolic agent into a vessel. The apparatus comprises a delivery catheter having a proximal section, a distal section and an intermediate section which is formed of a relatively flexible polymeric material. The catheter also includes a side opening at a location within the intermediate section, and a puller wire extending through the first lumen and being fixedly attached to the delivery catheter at a location proximal the distal end of the catheter. When the puller wire is pulled proximately the relatively flexible intermediate section deflects to thereby cause the side opening of the catheter to move laterally with respect to the catheter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> A more detailed explanation of the invention is provided in the following description and claims, and is illustrated in the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> generally illustrates the construction of a preferred embodiment of the delivery catheter of the present invention which generally comprises a dual lumen catheter <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having a &ldquo;Y&rdquo; connector <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> coupled to the proximal end of the catheter. More particularly, the dual lumen catheter includes a first lumen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and a second lumen <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The second lumen <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> extends from the proximal end of the catheter to the distal end of the catheter and also communicates with a lumen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which extends from the distal end to the proximal end of the &ldquo;Y&rdquo; connector <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. As illustrated, a side opening <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> extends from the second lumen <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> through the side wall of the catheter at a position which is slightly proximate the distal tip of the delivery catheter <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. This side opening, as will be subsequently explained in more detail, serves to permit the introduction of an embolic coil deployment device into an aneurysm for placement of an embolic coil into the aneurysm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> As further illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the first lumen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> extends from the proximal end of the delivery catheter <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to a position slightly proximal the location on the catheter of the side opening <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. At that point the first lumen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> exits the side wall of the catheter. A corresponding first lumen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>extends along the same axis as lumen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, but extends from the distal end of the catheter and also exits through the side wall of the catheter at a position slightly distal on the catheter of the side opening <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In addition, the proximal end of the first lumen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> communicates with a second passageway in the &ldquo;Y&rdquo; connector <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and extends out of the side port <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the &ldquo;Y&rdquo; connector <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. As may be seen, a puller wire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> extends from the proximal end of the side port <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the &ldquo;Y&rdquo; connector and through the lumen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the delivery catheter <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and exits the first lumen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and re-enters the corresponding first lumen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Still further, the puller wire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is fixedly attached within the corresponding first lumen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>at the distal end of this lumen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> While the delivery catheter <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be constructed of various flexible materials including various polymers, preferably, the catheter <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is formed in three different sections of materials having different durometers and different polymer compositions. The proximal section of the catheter <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>A, designated as &ldquo;A&rdquo; is preferably formed of a nylon material having a durometer of about 75D and extends for a length of about 100 centimeters. The intermediate section <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>B, designated &ldquo;B&rdquo;, is preferably formed of a pellethane material having a durometer of about 65D and is generally about 40 centimeters in length, and the distal section <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>C of the catheter, designated &ldquo;C&rdquo;, is preferably formed of a pellethane material having a durometer of about 80A and extends for a length of about 10 centimeters. With this construction the catheter is sufficiently flexible to be delivered through the various tortuous vessels of the human brain but at the same time provides sufficient rigidity or &ldquo;back-up&rdquo; support for introducing the catheter into and through these vessels. This construction also makes possible the ease of deflection, or bowing, of the intermediate section <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates a hydraulic occlusive coil deployment device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> which is comprised of a hydraulic injector, or syringe, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, coupled to the proximal end of a positioning catheter <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. An embolic coil <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is disposed within the lumen at the distal section <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> of the catheter. The proximal end of the coil <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is tightly held within the lumen of the distal section <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> of the catheter <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> until the deployment device is activated for release of the coil. As may be seen, the syringe <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> includes a threaded piston <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> which is controlled by the handle <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> for infusing fluid into the interior of the catheter <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Also, as illustrated, the catheter <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> includes a winged hub <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> which aids in the insertion of the catheter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The embolic coil <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> may take various forms and configurations, and may even take the form of a randomly wound coil. Preferably, the distal section of the coil deployment device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is formed of a polymeric material with a relatively low durometer which exhibits the characteristic that, when a fluid pressure of approximately 300 psi is applied to the interior of the catheter, the walls of the distal section <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> expand radially, somewhat similar to the action of a balloon inflating, to thereby release the proximal end of the coil <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Reference is made to the above-mentioned U.S. Pat. No. 6,113,622 for a more detailed description of the hydraulic occlusive coil deployment device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates in detail the delivery catheter <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which has been inserted into a blood vessel <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the brain in order to place an embolic coil <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> into an aneurysm <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference> illustrate cross-sections taken through the delivery catheter <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> at locations indicated by <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime; prime and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>&prime;, respectively, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. More particularly, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates the location <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> where the puller wire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> exits and re-enters through the side wall of the catheter. Also illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is an end view of the embolic coil deployment device which extends through the side opening <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the catheter <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates a sectional view of the delivery catheter <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with the first lumen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and second lumen <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which serve to carry the puller wire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the embolic coil deployment device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Reference is made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 6</cross-reference> through <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> for an understanding of the operation of the delivery catheter used in conjunction with the embolic coil deployment device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the delivery catheter is inserted into a vessel, preferably over a guidewire <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and is positioned such that the side opening <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is adjacent to an aneurysm <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The guidewire <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is then removed. Thereafter, the puller wire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is pulled proximally, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, to thereby cause the delivery catheter <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to deflect, or bow, in the region where the side opening <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is located to thereby cause the side opening to essentially mate with the opening of the aneurysm <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Once the opening has been positioned at the mouth of the aneurysm <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, the embolic coil deployment device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may then be inserted through the second lumen and then out of the side opening <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and into the aneurysm <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. An embolic coil <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> may then be placed into the aneurysm and released from the distal end of the deployment device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The deployment device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may then be removed and this process may be repeated until such time as sufficient coils have been placed into the aneurysm. When the aneurysm <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> has been sufficiently filled with embolic coils, the coil deployment device may be removed from the delivery catheter. Thereafter, the puller wire may be released to thereby permit the catheter to straighten within the vessel. Once the catheter has straightened within the vessel, the catheter may be easily withdrawn from the vessel and from the body of the patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> As may be appreciated, with the present invention it is possible to stabilize the delivery catheter at a position where the side opening of the delivery catheter is adjacent to the aneurysm. Embolic coils may be delivered through the side opening of the delivery catheter directly into the aneurysm with relatively good precision. With this system it is possible to fill an aneurysm with a plurality of embolic coils in very short order without the loss of coils into the main blood vessel, or other vessels within the body. These and other advantageous of this invention will become more apparent from an understanding of the invention as claimed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> A novel system and method have been disclosed in which an embolic coil, or coils, may be securely placed within an aneurysm with a delivery catheter which is stabilized. Although an illustrative embodiment of the invention has been shown and described, it is to be understood that various modifications and substitutions may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Further, in addition to the delivery of embolic coils, the system may be utilized to deliver other medical agents such as diagnostic or therapeutic agents of various types including liquid embolic materials. Other modifications may be made which would be within the spirit and the scope of the following claims. </paragraph>
