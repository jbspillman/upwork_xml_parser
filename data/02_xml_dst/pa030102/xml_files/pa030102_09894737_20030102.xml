<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Technical Field </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to mobile telephones and, more particularly, grouping phone numbers of certain calls in order to facilitate the annunciation of distinctive alerting sounds associated with each group of phone numbers or individual phone numbers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Alerting tones are nowadays one of the most popular features of the mobile phone. Different alerting tones are associated with different individuals or parties and are advantageous because the user has an idea of the caller already before seeing the display of the phone. The user can prepare in a suitable way to answering the phone immediately when it starts ringing. The knowledge of the source of the call has become of the utmost importance to these customers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, it is now commonplace for mobile telephones to provide user-adjustable operating characteristics such as the volume of an output signal, the ringing volume, and the generation of tone sequences upon receiving a call from a particular telephone number or from a telephone number stored in such a way that it is grouped with other telephone numbers in a category defined by the user or the vendor of the mobile telephone. For instance, U.S. Pat. No. 5,479,476 shows a mobile telephone having the capability to define a plurality of groups, each of which includes a plurality of user-adjustable characteristics. Values for individual characteristics may be input and one of the defined groups selected for use in controlling an operation of the mobile telephone, at least partially in accordance with the inputted values of the selected one of the groups. For instance, the characteristics might include sound volume, ringing tone, key tones, warning tones, lights, call transfer, etc. The different groups may constitute &ldquo;ambient conditions&rdquo;, such as indoors, outdoors, conference/theater, car, personal, etc. Each group has the individual characteristics set appropriately for the given ambient condition. For instance, the ringing tone may be made silent upon selecting the conference/theater group, and the key tones may be set &ldquo;off&rdquo; as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> There is a category or group of phone calls which is the recently-received phone calls which a user would not normally be inclined to include in any such groupings for future reference, because calls to or from these numbers are of a temporary nature and are not likely to be frequently called in the long-term. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It would be nonetheless desirable for the user to be able to distinguish calls from totally unknown sources from calls that have been used recently, but have not been grouped for alerting with distinctive characteristics. </paragraph>

The user can define separate alerting tones for the telephone numbers of recently called, received, or missed calls which are not stored in the permanent short code memory (SCM) of the phone. With this feature the user can distinguish the calls coming from totally unknown sources from the ones that have been used recently, but are of a temporary nature. These would typically be the numbers of offices, shops, hospitals, etc., where the user could make or from which the user would receive a few calls during a few days or a couple of weeks, but does not want to store them to the short code memory and define user groups and specific alerting tones for them, because the user does not expect to call them over the long-term future. Still, it would be helpful if calls coming from these recently frequently-used numbers could be distinguished from the other calls by a distinctive alerting sound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent in light of the detailed description of a best mode embodiment thereof, as illustrated in the accompanying drawing.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a series of steps which may be carried out in a mobile device such as a mobile telephone for storing a phone number of a recently made, received or missed call and associating the stored number with a distinctive alerting sound. After entering in a step <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a decision step <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is executed to determine if a call has recently been made, received or missed. For instance, if a call has been made, received or missed since the last execution of the routine shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, then it will be considered to be recent. If not, a return is made in a step <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. However, if a recent call has been made, received or missed, a step <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is executed in order to retrieve and specially store the phone number of the recently made, received or missed call in a memory or portion of memory set aside especially for that purpose. This memory or portion of memory is managed according to a selected capacity management methodology such that it has a capacity dedicated for only a limited number of phone numbers of such recently made, received or missed phone calls. This methodology could be a method of sizing the memory to some limited size or could be a methodology such as a first-in-first-out (FIFO) methodology, or other equivalent technique. The stored phone numbers of the recently made or received phone calls are removed one or more at a time according to the selected capacity management methodology. This is indicated generally at a step <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> indicated as a step of performing a memory management task. Referring back to the step <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, in addition to storing the phone number of the recently made, received or missed call, an association is made between the stored phone numbers of recently made, received or missed phone calls with a distinctive alerting sound generally indicative of recently made, received or missed phone calls. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Once a phone number is removed by the memory management methodology, the association may be cancelled. At any given time, a limited number of phone numbers of recently made, received or missed phone calls are stored in the memory and associated with the distinctive alerting sound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> As part of the storage process of step <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the step of associating can be prevented or omitted in a case where the call received from one of the phone numbers of recently made or received calls is found to match a phone number already stored in the memory by a user. Such might be for instance the phone number of an individual or organization known by the user and already positively associated by the user with a distinctive alerting sound for that user or organization. In that case, the storage and association of step <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> also includes a comparison step which allows the comparison of the phone number of the recently made, received or missed phone call with such phone numbers already prestored by the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> It should be realized that the step of associating <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be an association of a distinctive alerting sound for one or more or for each of the different categories of recently made, received or missed calls, i.e., each having alerting sounds distinct from each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> series of steps is shown for sounding a distinctive alerting sound for an incoming call that is found to be associated with either a known party or with a recently made, received or missed call that is temporarily stored in the memory set aside for these calls. After entering in a step <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a decision step <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is executed to determine if there is an incoming call or not. If not, it is repeated endlessly until an incoming call is detected. It should be realized that a return could be made instead of repeating step <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> endlessly and thereafter entering at step <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> again at a selected time. In any event, assuming there is an incoming call detected, a step <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is next executed to compare the phone number of the incoming call to numbers already stored by a user and already associated with distinctive alerting sounds for particular persons or organizations known to the user. If a match is found as determined in a step <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, a distinctive alerting sound associated to the telephone number of the incoming call is sounded as indicated in a step <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, followed by a return in a step <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> If no match were found in the step <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, a step <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is executed instead of step <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in order to compare the number of the incoming phone call to numbers of recently made, received or missed calls as previously stored in the step <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. If no match is found in a step <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, then the return step <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is executed. On the other hand, if a match is found by the step <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, then a step <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is executed to sound a distinctive alerting sound associated with recently made, received or missed calls after which a return is made in the step <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the user can thereby be alerted that the incoming call is from this category of recent calls. As mentioned previously, the alerting sound can be generically associated with all three of recently made, received or missed calls, i.e., generically &ldquo;recent&rdquo; calls or there can be provided separate distinctive alerting sounds for each type of recently made, received or missed calls. This is controlled in the step of associating in step <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> as previously discussed. It should be mentioned that the step <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> can be viewed as a step of defining a new group for storing a selected number of phone numbers of most recently made or received phone calls in a portion of the memory or in a separate memory having a storage capacity limited by the memory management process described in connection with step <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> so as to store the selected number of phone numbers only. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> mobile device such as a mobile telephone <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is shown capable of carrying out the step shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> according to the present invention. Such a mobile telephone includes a display <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, a keypad <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> for receiving keypad depressions <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> from a user as well as an antenna <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, a microphone <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and a speaker <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. These are all shown connected to an input/output (I/O) device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> which communicates with a control <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> over a data, address and control (DAC) bus <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> that interconnects various other functional blocks shown in the figure for carrying out the present invention. It would be realized that although separate functional blocks are shown, typically these functions would be embodied in a special purpose chip or software and coded for execution in such a way as to carry out the steps of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> using a general purpose computer, a special purpose computer, microcontroller or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> A memory <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> for storing phone numbers of recently made, received or missed phone calls.
