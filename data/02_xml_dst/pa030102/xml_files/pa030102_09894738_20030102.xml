<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to the field of driving devices for installing or removing specialized fasteners, such as eyebolts, hooks and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Eyebolts and hooks are convenient ways to hang things in a garage or barn. However, installing eyebolts and hooks in such locations can be tiring, time-consuming and difficult. Recently AC or battery powered drills have been tried for installing the eyebolts or hooks. Various adapters are known for installing or removing eyebolts with drills. However, these devices are generally dedicated to one particular type or size of eyebolt or hook and are not very versatile. Moreover, many of these devices are elaborate and time-consuming to assemble and attach to the eyebolt or hook. Thus, there is a need for a simple yet effective device for installing and removing eyebolts or hooks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Therefore, a primary objective of the present invention is a provision of a device for installing and removing eyebolts or hooks that is reliable, effective in use, easy to use and inexpensive to make. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Another objective of this invention is a provision of a device for installing and removing eyebolts or hooks that is versatile enough to accommodate various types and sizes of eyebolts and hooks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Another objective of the present invention is a provision of a device for installing and removing eyebolts or hooks that is adapted to be driven by a cordless or AC powered variable speed hand drill. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> These and other objectives will be apparent from the drawings, as well as from the description and claims that follow. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a device for driving specialized fasteners such as eyebolts, hooks and the like. The driver has a body that includes an elongated driver head with opposite forward and rear ends and a central axis of rotation extending through the ends. The body has means thereon for detachably connecting the driver head to a source of rotary power, for example a drill. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The head has a centrally located longitudinal slot of a fixed width and depth bifurcating its forward end so as to form a pair of opposing side walls and a bottom wall. The driver has a threaded hole extending through one of the side walls so as to intersect the slot at a location near the bottom wall. A set screw matingly installs in the threaded hole. The threaded hole and set screw are sized and arranged so that the set screw releasably engages an upper quadrant of the eyebolt rod that rests on the bottom wall. Thus, the set screw provides a clamping force directed toward both the bottom wall and the other side wall so as to effectively secure the eyebolt or hook in the slot. The slot preferably extends completely across the forward end of the driver head so the fastener to be driven can be inserted from the side or the end of the head. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> An optional counterbore in the forward end of the driver head can be used for clearance and location purposes when driving certain U-shaped hooks.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The device of the present invention is generally designated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The device is essentially a driver for installing and removing specialized fasteners such as eyebolts, hooks, and the like. The device or driver <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a rigid body <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of steel or other suitably strong material with an elongated driver head <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> having opposite forward and rear ends <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and a central axis of rotation <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> extending through the ends. The driver head <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is preferably cylindrically shaped; however, other shapes are possible so long as they are suitably balanced for rotation about the axis of rotation <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The body <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> also has means <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> thereon for detachably connecting the driver head <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to a conventional source of rotary power, such as an AC or cordless drill. Preferably the drill is a variable speed drill with a chuck capable of accepting drill bits with shanks up to &frac12; inch in diameter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The means <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for connecting the driver head <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to the drill is preferably in the form of a shank connected to the rearward end <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the driver head <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Preferably the shank has a hexagonal cross section. However, other means of connecting the driver head <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to the drill are contemplated to be within the scope of this invention, including but not limited to, a female socket of hexagonal or other suitable shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The driver head <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has a single centrally located longitudinal slot <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of a fixed width S<highlight><subscript>W </subscript></highlight>and depth S<highlight><subscript>D </subscript></highlight>bifurcating the forward end <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the driver head <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> so as to form a pair of opposing side walls <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and a bottom wall <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. In other words, the slot <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> extends across the forward end <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and along the central axis of rotation <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> towards the rear end <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Although not an absolute requirement, it is preferred that the slot <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> extends completely across the forward end <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the driver head <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The side walls <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the bottom wall <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are preferably planar. The slot <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> has a rectangular shape. Thus, the slot <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is adapted to slidably receive a portion of a fastener, such as an eyebolt <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> or another similar member. The width S<highlight><subscript>W </subscript></highlight>of the slot <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> should be slightly larger than the diameter of the cylindrical rod that forms the nonthreaded portion of the eyebolt <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The depth S<highlight><subscript>D </subscript></highlight>of the slot <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is selected so as to be at least as great as the diameter of the eyebolt rod. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The driver head <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has a threaded hole <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> extending through one of the side walls <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and a set screw <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> matingly installs into the threaded hole <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to selectively protrude into the slot <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Although the hole <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> could be angled or inclined without detracting from the invention, the hole <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is preferably perpendicular to the axis or rotation <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> for ease of machining. The hole <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> intersects the slot <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> at a location near the bottom wall <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the centerline of the hole <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is spaced forwardly or upwardly from the bottom wall <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> by a distance d<highlight><subscript>SS</subscript></highlight>. The necessary distance d<highlight><subscript>SS </subscript></highlight>can easily be determined based upon the size of the hole <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the size of the set screw <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and the diameter of the rod that forms the eyebolt eye and rests on the bottom wall <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The goal is to have the set screw <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> engage an upper quadrant of the eyebolt rod, as best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Such engagement provides a clamping force directed toward both the bottom wall <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the other side wall <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> SO as to effectively secure the eyebolt <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> or hook in the slot <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In use, the user loosens the set screw <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> so that it does not protrude into the slot <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Then the nonthreaded portion of the fastener or eyebolt <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is slidably inserted into the slot <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in the orientation suggested in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the set screw <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is then turned with an Allen wrench, screwdriver, or other conventional means until its leading end engages the upper lower portion of the fastener or eyebolt <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to secure it in the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The shank <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be inserted into the chuck of a drill and the eyebolt <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can be installed or removed at the desired location. Thus, the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is very easy to use and operate. The only moving part is the set screw <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. To remove the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from the eyebolt <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the user merely loosens the set screw <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> As illustrated by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is also quite versatile in that the same device can accommodate several different types of specialized fasteners, such as eyebolts, hooks and the like. Eyebolt <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is commonly known as an eye screw and has a wood screw end opposite its eye. The eye portion is formed of &frac12; inch nominal diameter rod. The device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> makes it possible to install such an eyebolt without predrilling a pilot hole. The device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> accepts eyebolts having a bolt end opposite the eye, as indicated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>A in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also adapts well to J-shaped hooks as indicated by reference numerals <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>C in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> To accommodate the U-shaped hook <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>D an optional cylindrical counterbore <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is provided in the forward end <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the driver head <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The counterbore <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is concentric with the axis of rotation <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, has a diameter greater than the width S<highlight><subscript>W </subscript></highlight>of the slot <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and a depth C<highlight><subscript>D </subscript></highlight>less than the slot depth S<highlight><subscript>D</subscript></highlight>. The counterbore <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> receives the nipple at the apex of the inverted U-shaped portion of the hook <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>D. The depth C<highlight><subscript>D </subscript></highlight>is preferably approximately the same as the length of the nipple. Of course, the set screw <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is not necessary when driving the hook <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>D. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> A smaller version of the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be constructed to drive eye screw <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>E and eyebolt <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>F, which both have eyes formed of &frac14; diameter rods. In fact, the examples provided below show preferred nominal dimensions for various features of the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to drive &frac12; and &frac14; specialized fasteners respectively. </paragraph>
