<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">An entrance grid is positioned in the incident beam path of a DC beam positron lifetime spectrometer. The difference between the potentials applied to the sample and the entrance grid provides simultaneous acceleration of both the primary positrons and the secondary electrons. The result is a reduction in the time spread induced by variation of the secondary electron energy. The spectrometer also includes a means for path separation of the incoming positrons and the outgoing secondary electrons from the sample in the non-acceleration range. The result is a positron lifetime spectrometer with a wide time range representing exponential decay functions of annihilation radiation intensity, and an improved time resolution. Results to date show that a valid time range of more than 300 nsec, a time resolution of 570 psec, and a signal-to-noise ratio of 3300 have been achieved. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a positron lifetime spectrometer based on a DC positron beam. More particularly, it relates to a positron lifetime spectrometer having a wide valid time range that results from a uniquely straightforward spectrometer design and an improved time resolution brought about by simultaneously accelerating both the primary positrons and the secondary electrons produced by the spectrometer. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">Background Information </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> As materials are engineered and manipulated at nanometer scale, defects in those materials become very important because they can drastically alter the material properties and device functionality. Conventional techniques such as cross section transmission electron microscopy (XTEM) and neutron scattering are limited by their selectivity and sensitivity to micro open-volume defects. Positron lifetime spectroscopy (PLS), on the other hand, is fundamentally sensitive to open-volume defects because positrons are preferentially trapped at defect sites. In addition, positron spectroscopy is a nondestructive technique. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> When positrons enter a solid, they are trapped in vacancies, vacancy clusters and voids because these sites provide local minima in the potential energy. The trapped positrons annihilate with the electrons of surrounding atoms, generating gamma (&ggr;) radiation that is used to signature defects. By varying the energy of the incident positrons, the characterization of defects as a function of depth in the material can be carried out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In one current method, positron lifetime spectroscopy based on an isotope positron source detects size and concentration of defects in bulk materials. Isotope-based PLS, however, is a non-beam type of PLS that cannot characterize defects in thin films or in their substrate interfaces because positrons generated by an isotope yield a broad energy distribution varying from 0 to 500 keV. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In recent years, positron lifetime spectroscopy in conjunction with either a variable energy pulsed positron beam or a variable energy DC positron beam has been found to be increasingly useful for characterizing defects in thin films and their substrate interfaces as semiconductor and optical devices are made in nanometer scale. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The measures of performance of a positron lifetime spectrometer include 1) the time range over which a sum of exponential decay functions are fitted to the lifetime spectrum without interference from spurious structures, i.e., &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; peaks; 2) the time resolution, defined as the full width of half-maximum (FWHM) of a single time peak; and 3) the signal-to-noise ratio. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Schodlbauer et al of the Institut fur Nukleare Festkorperphysik of Germany has conducted positron lifetime spectroscopy using a pulsed positron beam. That spectrometer chops a DC positron beam into pulses, then bunches the pulses into narrow pulses. An advantage of the spectrometer system is its ability to generate very narrow pulses. A disadvantage is that the system requires the construction of a buncher, which is very expensive. Another disadvantage is the loss of many positrons during the chopping and bunching processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Suzuki et al of the Electrotechnical Laboratory in Japan has a different pulsed beam positron lifetime spectrometer. It employs a longitudinal rather than transversal chopper, and it also utilizes a positron buncher. The spectrometer reduces positron loss during the chopping process. However, its disadvantages are the same as those of the Munich spectrometer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Closer to the present invention is a positron lifetime spectrometer originated by Lynn et al at Brookhaven National Laboratory, and revised by Szpala. Lynn&apos;s original spectrometer is based on a DC positron beam, and it uses the secondary electrons generated by the primary positrons as a time signal. The revised spectrometer relies on an additional electrode, called a retarding grid, to accelerate the electrons. However, the electrical potential applied to the retarding grid (&plus;600 V) decelerates the incoming positrons. Therefore, the potential cannot be too high (&lt;600 V) or it interferes with the incoming positrons. This constraint limits the reduction of the time spread induced by the electron energy distribution. The spectrometer also uses an ExB field for separating the electron flight path from that of the primary positrons. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The valid time range of the Szpala revised spectrometer is 0-3 nsec. After that, there are some &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; structures, possibly due to the contributions from back-scattered positrons annihilating in the ExB separator. The spectrometer has a time resolution of 475 psec. The signal-to-noise ratio of the Szpala spectrometer is about 100 in its valid time range. If the &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; structures are discounted, the signal-to-noise ratio of the Szpala spectrometer is much higher. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The present invention is a positron lifetime spectrometer based on a DC positron beam. It is useful in studies of advanced materials such as characterizing pore structures in thin films. It uses the secondary electrons generated by bombardment of the primary positrons on the sample to start the positron lifetime clock, and uses the detection signal of the annihilation gamma (&ggr;) radiation to stop the clock. The spectrometer is of a uniquely simple construction that utilizes the sample potential to simultaneously accelerate both the primary (incident) positrons and the secondary electrons. This construction provides the important benefit of reducing the time spread induced by the energy distribution of the secondary electrons, while also providing a spectrometer operating in a very straightforward manner. In an additional construction feature of the invention, the path of the secondary electrons is separated from that of the incoming positrons. This is achieved by tilting the beam acceleration direction away from the original positron direction, i.e., the direction of the incoming positron beam. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> DC positron beam <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is generated in a vacuum chamber <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The positrons can be produced by moderation of positrons emitted from radioactive isotopes, or they can be produced as a positron beam from an electron linear accelerator, for example. More particularly, the beam <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is made up of positrons having a monochromatic energy of, for example, 10 eV. The positrons move in approximately the same direction due to the presence of a magnetic field B. The positrons <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> strike the sample <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, which may be a thin solid film, a film substrate interface, or a substrate, for example. The sample <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is mounted in a metallic sample holder <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> that can be maintained at a selected electrical potential. The sample is thus maintained at the sample holder potential. When the mono-energetic positrons <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> bombard the sample <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, secondary electrons <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are ejected from the sample. The detection of the secondary electrons <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> by a shielded multi-channel plate (MCP) electron detector <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is used to generate the start signal for the positron lifetime spectrometer. The MCP detector <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is typically mounted in an electrically shielded housing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> that is maintained at a potential V<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. The. MCP electron detector <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and housing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> comprise a MCP electron detector assembly <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The stop signal of the spectrometer is derived from the detection of the gamma radiation <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> from the positron annihilations. This is accomplished with a scintillation detector <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, such as a BaF<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>detector, for example, and an associated PM tube <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The scintillation detector <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is shielded by a collimator <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> that is used to align the detector <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> with the sample <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Measurements of the number of annihilation events as a function of the difference between the start time and the stop time are then used to construct the positron lifetime spectrum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The above described elements and functions are considered to be known in the art. The present invention has to do with providing a means for simultaneously accelerating both the incoming positrons and the secondary electrons by a single potential difference between the sample and an entrance grid in front of the sample. The invention also separates the path of the secondary electrons from that of the positrons by tilting the acceleration direction away from the incident positron direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> More particularly, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the incident positron beam <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is initially passed through an entrance grid <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> that has been carefully positioned in front of the sample <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The incident positrons <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are accelerated to the desired implantation energy by the potential V<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>applied to the sample holder <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The potential V<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>is lower than the potential V<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>applied to the entrance grid <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The potential difference V<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&minus;V<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>accelerates the secondary electrons <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> away from the sample <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> toward the multi-channel-plate (MCP) electron detector <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The entrance face <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of the electron detector assembly <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is positioned parallel to the sample <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The energy of the secondary electrons <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is distributed in a range between approximately 0 and 40 eV, depending on the sample material. For example, a 10 eV spread of energy would cause hundreds of psec worse time resolution for 600 V acceleration. With the acceleration of electrons provided by this invention, for example 10 kV, the time spread induced by the 10 eV electron energy uncertainty is reduced to less than 100 psec. Another benefit of the simultaneous acceleration method is that no additional bias is needed for accelerating the electrons, which would decelerate the incoming positrons. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Another advantage of the simultaneous acceleration (dual acceleration) method is less contribution of backscattering positrons since the amount of apparatus in front of sample is minimized. Because of this advantage, no abnormal or &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; structures are produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> also illustrates a second major aspect of the invention, the separation of the secondary electron path from the path of the incoming positrons. The sample <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, sample holder <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, entrance grid <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and entrance face <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of the multichannel plate electron detector assembly <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> are made to be parallel to each other, and are arranged at a tilt angle &thgr; to the axis of the positron beam <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Because of the potential difference V<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&minus;V<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, the incoming positrons <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> strike the sample <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> approximately normal to its surface. This is shown in more detail in the computer simulation graph of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The tilt angle &thgr; of the sample <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, sample holder <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, entrance grid <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and entrance face <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of the multichannel plate electron detector assembly <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> effectively separates the path of the secondary electrons <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> from the path of the incident positrons <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The tilt angle is selected such that the electron detector assembly <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> does not block the incoming positron beam <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. An angle of about 45 degrees was found to be practical in some test embodiments of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> A large number of positron beam characterization facilities have found it useful to maintain the sample at ground or positive electrical potential. In our invention, V<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>can be maintained at 0 V or at a positive potential. The potential V<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>would still be maintained at a higher potential than V<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a computer simulation graph illustrating the trajectories of both the incident positrons <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the secondary electrons <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in the spectrometer. In this calculation, the incident positrons have an energy of 10 eV. The energy spread of secondary electrons initially emitted from the surface is considered to be 0-10 eV. The sample potential is &minus;10 kV and the potential applied to the entrance grid is 0 V. A 50 gauss magnetic field is assigned to the system, with its direction parallel to the direction of the incoming positrons. The tilt angle &thgr; is 45&deg;. The trajectories show that the flight paths of the electrons and the positrons are clearly separated. Considering the distance between the entrance grid and the sample to be 10 mm, and the distance between the entrance grid and the electron detector to be 60 mm, the time spread induced by the 10-eV energy spread of the secondary electrons is only 51 psec in this calculation. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Positron backscattering, which can cause abnormal structures in some spectrometers, is not a problem in this invention because no ExB separator is used in front of the sample. The 570 psec or even higher time resolution is achieved by the elimination of most of the time spread induced by energy distribution of the secondary electrons. In the valid time range of this test of the invention (0-300 nsec), the signal-to-noise ratio was 3300. </paragraph>
