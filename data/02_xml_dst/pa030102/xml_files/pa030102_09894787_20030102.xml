<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to air conditioners for vehicles and, more particularly, to an air conditioner for vehicles having a two layer flow structure, designed to feed recirculation air and fresh air in a separate air feeding or a mixed air feeding using a single intake duct and a single intake control door, thus improving its heating and defrosting efficiency during a heating mode operation, and preventing an undesired discharging of white fogging from the vents during a cooling mode operation by changing its air feeding mode from a recirculation air mode to fresh air feeding mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is a view, showing the construction and operation of a conventional air conditioner for vehicles. As shown in the drawing, the conventional air conditioner for vehicles typically comprises a cooling unit and a heating unit, either of which is selectively operated as desired. In an operation of the conventional air conditioner in a cooling mode, a compressor <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is operated by the rotating force of the internal combustion engine (not shown) of a vehicle to compress refrigerant prior to feeding the compressed refrigerant to a condenser <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. At the condenser <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, ambient air forcibly fed from a cooling fan (not shown) absorbs heat from the refrigerant, thus condensing and cooling the refrigerant. The condensed refrigerant from the condenser <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> then passes through a receiver dryer <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, an expansion valve <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, and an evaporator <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> sequentially prior to being returned to the compressor <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, thus accomplishing one refrigeration cycle. During the above-mentioned refrigeration cycle, pressurized air fed from the fan <highlight><bold>661</bold></highlight> of a blower unit <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> passes by the evaporator <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> while losing heat to the cold refrigerant, thus becoming cooled air prior to being discharged from the housing of the air conditioner into the passenger compartment of the vehicle. In an operation of the air conditioner in a heating mode, the pressurized air fed from the fan <highlight><bold>661</bold></highlight> of the blower unit <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is heated by hot coolant passing through a heater core <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> when the hot coolant is returned to the engine through the heater core <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>. During the heating mode, the air is thus heated prior to being discharged from the housing of the air conditioner into the passenger compartment, while the coolant is cooled prior to being returned to the engine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In such a conventional air conditioner, both the evaporator <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and the heater core <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> are set within the housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the air conditioner. The blower unit <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is installed inside the air inlet end of the housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> at a position in front of the evaporator <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, while three air outlet vents: a defrost vent <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, a face vent <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and a floor vent <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> are provided in the air outlet end of the housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> at positions in back of the heater core <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>. Of the three air outlet vents, the defrost vent <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> discharges warm or cold air from the housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to the windshield and side glasses of the vehicle, thus defrosting the windshield and side glasses. The face vent <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> discharges warm or cold air from the housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to the upper portion inside the passenger compartment, thus heating or cooling the upper portion of the compartment. The floor vent <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> discharges warm or cold air from the housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to the lower portion of the passenger compartment, thus heating or cooling the lower portion of the compartment. A vent control door <highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>731</bold></highlight> is installed at each of the three air outlet vents <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> to control the vents as desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In the conventional air conditioner, both a fresh air intake opening <highlight><bold>663</bold></highlight> and a recirculation air intake opening <highlight><bold>664</bold></highlight> are respectively formed on the upper portion of the blower case <highlight><bold>662</bold></highlight> of the blower unit <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> at opposite sides of the case <highlight><bold>662</bold></highlight>, with one intake control door <highlight><bold>665</bold></highlight> hinged to the case <highlight><bold>662</bold></highlight> such that the door <highlight><bold>665</bold></highlight> selectively closes either of the two air intake openings <highlight><bold>663</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>664</bold></highlight> as desired. Therefore, when only fresh air is introduced into the housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> through the fresh air intake opening <highlight><bold>663</bold></highlight> to circulate the fresh air in the passenger compartment during an operation of the air conditioner, the compressor <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is undesirably overloaded to excessively consume power of the engine. On the other hand, when only recirculation air is introduced into the housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> through the recirculation air intake opening <highlight><bold>664</bold></highlight> to circulate the recirculation air in the passenger compartment during an operation of the air conditioner, the circulated air within the passenger compartment is gradually reduced in its freshness to become contaminated, thus ill-affecting the passenger&apos;s health. When the intake control door <highlight><bold>665</bold></highlight> is positioned at its neutral position to allow fresh air and recirculation air to be mixed together, the recirculation air included in the mixed air is continuously discharged into the passenger compartment during an operation of the air conditioner, thus preventing the passengers from feeling freshness of the fresh air and forcing the passengers to feel unpleasant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In an effort to overcome such problems experienced in the conventional air conditioner for vehicles, another air conditioner designed to feed recirculation air and fresh air into the passenger compartment in a separate air feeding or a mixed air feeding, has been proposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. Heisei.9-24722 discloses an example of such air conditioners. This air conditioner has three air intake openings, with two intake control doors used for controlling the flow of recirculation and fresh air through the three intake openings. However, this air conditioner is problematic in that it requires too many parts, inducing a complex construction, due to the complex mechanism for operating the intake control door. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Another example of such air conditioners may be referred to Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. Heisei. 9-24723. This air conditioner has first and second air intake openings designed to selectively recirculation or fresh air, in addition to a third air intake opening used for intaking recirculation air exclusively, with two intake control doors used for controlling the flow of recirculation and fresh air through the three intake openings. However, this air conditioner is problematic in that it requires too many parts, inducing a complex construction, due to the complex mechanism for operating the intake control door in the same manner as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A further example of such air conditioners may be referred to Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication Nos. Heisei. 9-156348 and Heisei. 10-16539. Each of these air conditioners has one fresh air intake opening and two recirculation air intake openings, with two intake control doors used for controlling the flow of recirculation and fresh air through the three intake openings. In addition, Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication Nos. Heisei. 9-240247, Heisei. 9-240248 and Heisei. 10-86637 each disclose an air conditioner having one recirculation air intake opening, one fresh air intake opening, and two intake control door of the sliding type used for controlling the flow of recirculation or fresh air through the recirculation air intake opening and the fresh air intake opening. This air conditioner also has one recirculation air intake opening controlled by a separate intake control door. As further prior art reference documents, Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication Nos. Heisei. 10-915 and Heisei. 10-86637 each disclose an air conditioner having one recirculation air intake opening and one fresh air intake opening with one intake control door used for controlling the flow of recirculation or fresh air through the recirculation air intake opening and fresh air intake opening. This air conditioner also has one recirculation air intake opening controlled by a separate intake control door. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> However, the above-mentioned air conditioners are problematic in that they have two intake control doors for controlling the flow of recirculation and fresh air relative to the housing, with a link mechanism for accomplishing a cooperative operation of the intake control doors, thus necessarily having too many parts and a complex construction. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the present invention has been made keeping in mind the above problems occurring in the prior art, and an object of the present invention is to provide an air conditioner for vehicles, which is designed to feed recirculation and fresh air in a separate air feeding or a mixed air feeding using a single intake duct and a single intake control door, thus improving its heating and defrosting efficiency during a heating mode operation, and preventing an undesired discharging of white fogging from the vents during a cooling mode operation by changing its air feeding mode from a recirculation air mode to a fresh air mode, and which preferably is simplified in its construction, in addition to being reduced in its production cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In order to accomplish the above object, the present invention provides an air conditioner for vehicles. The air conditioner comprises a housing, a partition member, a first heat exchanger , a first blower fan and a second blower fan. The housing defines a chamber and the chamber defines first and second openings configured to allow first and second air flows to enter an inside of the chamber, respectively. The partition member is configured to divide the inside of the housing into first and second passages. The partition member extends through the inside of the chamber and is configured to divide the chamber into first and second compartments. The first heat exchanger is configured to pass through an opening in the partition member so as to be located in the first and second passages. The first blower fan is located in the first compartment of the chamber and is configured to blow at least one of the first and second air flows to the first heat exchanger along the first passage. The second blower fan is located in the second compartment of the chamber and is configured to blow at least one of the first and second air flows to the first heat exchanger along the second passage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, a communication vent opened or closed by a vent control door is preferably formed at the rear portion of the horizontal partition wall to allow the upper and lower air passages to communicate to each other selectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In a fresh air mode operation of the heating, the intake control door closes the recirculation air intake opening of the intake duct. Therefore, only fresh air is introduced into the intake duct through the fresh air intake opening, and flows into both the upper and lower scroll compartments through the air guide duct, and flows through the upper and lower air passages prior to being discharged into the passenger compartment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In a recirculation air mode operation of the air conditioner, the intake control door closes the fresh air intake opening of the intake duct. Therefore, only recirculation air is introduced into the intake duct through the recirculation air intake opening, and flows into both the upper and lower scroll compartments through the air guide duct, and flows through the upper and lower air passages prior to being discharged into the passenger compartment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In a separate air feeding operation of the air conditioner, the intake control door is aligned with the passage dividing means, thus allowing the recirculation and fresh air intake openings of the intake duct to separately communicate with the lower and upper scroll compartments through the air guide duct. Therefore, fresh air and recirculation air separately flow through the upper and lower air passages prior to being separately discharged from the housing into the passenger compartment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In a mixed air feeding operation of the air conditioner, the intake control door is positioned at a space between the passage dividing means and the fresh air intake opening. Therefore, recirculation air from the recirculation air intake opening flows to both scroll compartments, while fresh air from the fresh air intake opening only flows to the lower scroll compartment. Mixed air of the recirculation air and the fresh air from the upper scroll compartment flows through the upper air passage prior to being discharged into the passenger compartment, while recirculation air from the lower scroll compartment flows through the lower air passage prior to being discharged into the passenger compartment.</paragraph>

The air guide duct <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is connected with both the scroll case <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the air inlet end of the housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Therefore the air guide duct <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>guides recirculation or fresh air from a selected air intake opening <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to one of the upper and lower scroll compartments <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In an operation of the air conditioner of this invention, it is sometime necessary to allow recirculation air to exclusively flow into the lower scroll compartment <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> through the air guide duct <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and fresh air to exclusively flow into the upper scroll compartment <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. In order to accomplish the above object, a passage dividing means <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is preferably formed on the top wall of the upper scroll compartment <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> such that it selectively divides the interior of the intake duct <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>into two passages, separately communicating with the upper scroll compartment <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the lower scroll compartments <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, in cooperation with the vent control door <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> placed at a predetermined position. The passage dividing means <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is preferably formed to the shape of prominence (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) or the shape of depression (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The operational effect of the air conditioner of this invention will be described herein below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In a fresh air mode operation of the air conditioner as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, the intake control door <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> closes the recirculation air intake opening <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of the intake duct <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, but opens the fresh air intake opening <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Therefore, only fresh air is introduced into the intake duct <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>through the fresh air intake opening <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The fresh air is thus introduced into both the upper scroll compartment <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the lower scroll compartment <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> through the air guide duct <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and flows into the upper and lower air passages <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by the blowing force of the upper and lower blower fans <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. When the fresh air flows through the upper and lower air passages <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, it passes by the evaporator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the heater core <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, thus being cooled by the evaporator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> or warmed by the heater core <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The cold air or warm air flows to the air outlet ends of the upper and lower air passages <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> prior to being discharged from the housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> into the passenger compartment of a vehicle through the vents <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In a recirculation air mode operation of the air conditioner as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, the intake control door <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> closes the fresh air intake opening <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the intake duct <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, but opens the recirculation air intake opening <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. Therefore, only recirculation air is introduced into the intake duct <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>through the recirculation air intake opening <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. In such a case, the recirculation air is introduced into both the upper scroll compartment <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the lower scroll compartment <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> through the air guide duct <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and flows into the upper and lower air passages <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by the blowing force of the upper and lower blower fans <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. When the recirculation air flows through the upper and lower air passages <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, it passes by the evaporator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the heater core <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, thus being cooled by the evaporator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> or warmed by the heater core <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The cold air or warm air flows to the air outlet ends of the upper and lower air passages <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> prior to being discharged from the housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> into the passenger compartment through the vents <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In a separate air feeding operation of the air conditioner as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>, the intake control door <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is rotated such that the free end of the door <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is aligned with the passage dividing means <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the recirculation air intake opening <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the fresh air intake opening <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the intake duct <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are opened. In such a case, the recirculation air intake opening <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> communicates with the lower scroll compartment <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, while the fresh air intake opening <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> communicates with the upper scroll compartment <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Therefore, fresh air, introduced into the upper scroll compartment <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> through the fresh air intake opening <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, flows into the upper air passage <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by the blowing force of the upper blower fan <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. recirculation air, introduced into the lower scroll compartment <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> through the recirculation air intake opening <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the air guide duct <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, flows into the lower air passage <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by the blowing force of the lower blower fan <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. When the fresh air and recirculation air separately flow into the upper and lower air passages <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as described above, they pass by the evaporator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the heater core <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, thus being separately cooled by the evaporator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> or warmed by the heater core <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The cold air or warm air flows to the air outlet ends of the upper and lower air passages <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> prior to being discharged from the housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> into the passenger compartment through the vents <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In a mixed air feeding operation of the air conditioner as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>, the intake control door <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is rotated such that it is positioned at a space between the passage dividing means <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and the fresh air intake opening <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The recirculation air intake opening <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the fresh air intake opening <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the intake duct <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are thus opened in the same manner as that described for the separate air feeding mode operation. However, since the vent control door <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is not aligned with the passage dividing means <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, but is somewhat raised toward the fresh air intake opening <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> while leaving an opening between the passage dividing means <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and the intake control door <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> as best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the recirculation air from the recirculation air intake opening <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> flows to both scroll compartments <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. However, the fresh air from the fresh air intake opening <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is less likely to flow to the lower scroll compartment <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, but only flows to the upper scroll compartment <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the upper scroll compartment <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> receives mixed air of the recirculation air and the fresh air, while the lower scroll compartment <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> only receives the recirculation air. The mixed air of the recirculation air and the fresh air from the upper scroll compartment <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> flows into the upper air passage <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by the blowing force of the upper blower fan <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, while the recirculation air from the lower scroll compartment <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> through the air guide duct <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>flows into the lower air passage <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by the blowing force of the lower blower fan <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. When the mixed air and recirculation air separately flow through the upper and lower air passages <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as described above, they pass by the evaporator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the heater core <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, thus being separately cooled by the evaporator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> or warmed by the heater core <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The cold air or warm air flows to the air outlet ends of the two air passages <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> prior to being discharged from the housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> into the passenger compartment through the vents <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The mixed air feeding mode operation is preferably usable in a cooling mode operation of the air conditioner as follows. That is, when the air conditioner continuously carries out a recirculation air mode operation as a cooling mode operation, circulated air may be gradually reduced in its freshness since it is contaminated as time goes by. Therefore, it is necessary to intermittently introduce fresh air into the passenger compartment to refresh the circulated air. When high temperature and high-humidity fresh air is introduced into the housing of the air conditioner to refresh the circulated air during such a cooling mode operation, conventional air conditioners may undesirably force some of the condensed water of the fresh air through the air outlet vents as white fogging since the high temperature and high-humidity fresh air comes into contact with the low temperature and low-humidity surface of the evaporator. However, the air conditioner of this invention does not allow such white fogging to be discharged from the air outlet vents since it is possible to reduce the difference in the temperature and humidity between the air and the evaporator by mixing the low temperature and low-humidity indoor air and the high temperature and high-humidity fresh air together within the intake duct <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>prior to feeding the mixed air to the evaporator by the blowing force of the fans <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> During each of the above-mentioned operational modes of the air conditioner, it is possible to separately discharge cold or warm air currents from the upper and lower air passages into the passenger compartment, or discharge the cold or warm air currents from the air passages after mixing the air currents together by controlling the communication vent <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the horizontal partition wall <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> As described above, the present invention provides an air conditioner for vehicles, which is designed to feed recirculation air and fresh air in a separate air feeding or a mixed air feeding using a single intake duct <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a single intake control door <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. This air conditioner thus has a simple construction and reduced production cost, in addition to accomplishing the recent trend of compactness of air conditioners. The air conditioner is also improved in its heating and defrosting efficiency during a heating mode operation, and prevents an undesired discharging of white fogging from the vents during a cooling mode operation by changing its air feeding mode from a recirculation air mode to a fresh air mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Although a preferred embodiment of the present invention has been described for illustrative purposes, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications, additions and substitutions are possible, without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention as disclosed in the accompanying claims. </paragraph>
