<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to gas turbine engines, and, more specifically, to turbine nozzles therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In a gas turbine engine, air is pressurized in a compressor, mixed with fuel in a combustor, and ignited for generating hot combustion gases which flow downstream into a turbine which extracts energy therefrom. The turbine includes a turbine nozzle having a plurality of circumferentially spaced apart nozzle vanes supported by integral outer and inner bands. A high pressure turbine nozzle first receives the hottest combustion gases from the combustor and channels those gases to a turbine rotor having a plurality of circumferentially spaced apart rotor blades extending radially outwardly from a supporting disk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Overall engine efficiency is directly related to the temperature of the combustion gases which must be limited to protect the various turbine components which are heated by the gases. The high pressure turbine nozzle must withstand the high temperature combustion gases from the combustor for a suitable useful life. This is typically achieved by using superalloy materials which maintain strength at high temperature, and diverting a portion of compressor air for use as a coolant in the turbine nozzle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Superalloy strength is limited, and diverted compressor air reduces the overall efficiency of the engine. Accordingly, engine efficiency is limited in practice by the availability of suitable superalloys, and the need to divert compressor air for cooling turbine nozzles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Ceramic materials are being considered for the advancement of turbine nozzles to further increase the temperature capability thereof and reduce the use of diverted cooling air therefor. However, conventional ceramic materials available for this purpose have little ductility and require special mounting configurations for preventing fracture damage thereof limiting their useful life. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Turbine nozzle design is further complicated since the nozzle is an annular assembly of vanes which are subject to three dimensional aerodynamic loading and temperature gradients therethrough. Turbine nozzles expand and contract during operation, with attendant thermally induced stress therefrom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is desired to provide an improved turbine nozzle formed of ceramic for withstanding the hostile environment of a gas turbine engine. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a schematic representation of a portion of a gas turbine engine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which is axisymmetrical about a longitudinal or axial centerline axis <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The core engine is illustrated and includes a conventional multistage compressor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which pressurizes air <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> that is discharged to an annular combustor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in which fuel is injected and ignited for generating hot combustion gases <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Disposed at the outlet of the combustor is an annular first stage hybrid turbine nozzle <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention which directs the combustion gases to a following high pressure turbine <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The turbine <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> includes a row of rotor blades supported by a rotor disk which in turn is joined to the compressor by a rotor shaft extending therebetween. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The turbine extracts energy from the combustion gases to power the compressor during operation. And, a low pressure turbine <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is disposed downstream from the high pressure turbine for extracting additional energy from the combustion gases for producing useful work, such as powering a fan (not shown) in a turbofan aircraft gas turbine engine application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> As indicated above, overall engine efficiency may be maximized by increasing the operating temperature of the combustion gases. However, cooling air must be bled from the compressor which correspondingly decreases overall engine efficiency. The hybrid turbine nozzle illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> provides a new assembly of components specifically configured for reducing the need for bleeding cooling air from the compressor, and therefore further increases overall efficiency of the engine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The turbine nozzle initially illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> includes a radially outer ceramic outer band <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, and a radially inner ceramic inner band <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> disposed coaxially around the centerline axis <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A ceramic vane aft segment <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is integrally joined at opposite radial or span ends to the outer and inner bands. And a metal vane forward segment <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> adjoins the aft segment along a radial splitline <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> extending radially in span between the two bands. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> An exemplary one of the hybrid vanes is illustrated in radial section in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> in which the aft and forward segments <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> collectively define the overall aerodynamic profile of the vane airfoil as required for channeling the combustion gases to the high pressure turbine in accordance with conventional practice. However, instead of providing a unitary vane formed of typical superalloy metal, the nozzle vanes illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> are hybrid constructions of ceramic aft segments and metal forward segments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Conventional ceramics may be used such as monolithic silicon nitride (Si<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>N<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>), which is a toughened ceramic commercially available from Honeywell Specialty Materials of Los Angeles, Calif. under the tradename AS800 or similar material. And, any conventional high-temperature capable metal such as nickel-based superalloys typically used in turbine vanes may be used for the forward segments <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In this way, the high-temperature capability of monolithic ceramic may be used for a majority of each vane, with the forward segment thereof being formed of conventional superalloy metal for its enhanced strength and durability in the hostile environment of a gas turbine engine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> As indicated above, ceramics are highly heat resistant but have little ductility and are subject to erosion or damage during operation at a greater rate than that of superalloy metal. Correspondingly, superalloy metal is limited in high-temperature capability, yet is quite durable and can readily withstand erosion due to particulate matter, such as carbon, found in the combustion gases discharged from the combustor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the forward segment <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> includes the vane leading edge <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> around which the combustion gases <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> split during operation. The aft segment includes the trailing edge <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> aft of which the combustion gases rejoin or flow to the turbine. The aft and forward segments collectively define the aerodynamic profile of the vane airfoil including the generally concave pressure side <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, and the generally convex suction side <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> which extend chordally or axially between the leading and trailing edges of the vane on opposite sides thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the two segments extend in radial span from a root <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> at the junction with the inner band <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to a tip <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> at the junction with the outer band. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the bands <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are preferably formed in arcuate segments which collectively define the full 360 degree extent of the turbine nozzle. And, each vane segment preferably includes a pair of the hybrid vanes extending radially between the bands. The vane segments circumferentially abut each other in the nozzle and may be suitably sealed in any conventional manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the forward segment <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is hollow along its span and includes a leading edge flow channel <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> through which a portion of the compressed air <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> bled from the compressor is channeled for cooling the forward segment. And, the aft segment <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> includes a cylindrical passage or bore <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> extending in span between the outer and inner bands. Additional cooling air may be channeled through the bore <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> for cooling the aft segment during operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> A particular advantage of the hybrid vane construction is that the ceramic aft segment requires relatively little cooling during operation, and therefore relatively little air must be bled from the compressor for cooling thereof. Since the metal forward segment <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is limited in configuration and size for the leading edge portion of the vane itself, the amount of cooling air bled from the compressor for the forward segment is also limited. In this way, less cooling air is required for cooling each hybrid vane as compared to a full metal vane. The reduced cooling air requirement for the hybrid vane permits a corresponding increase in overall engine efficiency not otherwise possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates schematically an exemplary radial temperature profile for the combustion gases channeled through the turbine nozzle. The temperature profile is generally parabolic with maximum gas temperature near the middle thereof and decreasing in temperature to the outer and inner bands. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, each vane is subject to a large gradient in temperature of the combustion gases, which in turn subjects the hybrid vanes to thermally induced stress. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Thermal stress in the ceramic aft segment may be substantially reduced by radially bifurcating each aft segment into a radially outer section <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> integrally joined to the outer band <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</cross-reference>, and a radially inner section <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> integrally joined to the inner band <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The two sections are separated from each other by an axially or chordally extending splitline <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. The axial splitline interrupts the radial continuity of the ceramic aft segment to prevent buildup of large thermally induced stress due to the large gradient of the combustion gases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> pair of the ceramic outer sections <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are integrally joined to the ceramic outer band <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in a unitary or one-piece assembly which may be conventionally manufactured using a common casting mold therefor. Similarly, a pair of the ceramic inner sections <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are integrally joined to the inner band <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in another unitary or one-piece construction made using another common casting mold therefor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> When assembled, the outer and inner sections are radially aligned with each other, and a single or unitary metal forward segment <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is disposed in the front of each vane segment to extend the full radial span of the collective vane assembly radially bridging the axial splitline <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, with the radial splitline <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> being disposed axially between the forward and aft segments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In view of the two-part aft vane segments <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, a support rod <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, of either ceramic or nickel-based superalloy material, extends through the central bore <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the aft segments, as well as through corresponding apertures in the outer and inner bands. The support rod maintains radial alignment of the two sections <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, and both axial and circumferential alignment of the supporting two bands. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> An annular outer support frame <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is configured for trapping the row of outer bands therein, and an annular inner frame <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is configured for trapping the row of inner bands therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The two frames <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> may be formed of any suitable metal and preferably extend in 360 degree rings of one or more metal components to define generally U-shaped channels in which the respective bands are retained and trapped axially. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the outer frame <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is supported in a portion of an annular outer casing <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of the engine for in turn supporting the nozzle assembly <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The inner frame <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> supports the segments of the inner band <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in a full ring, and includes an annular seal carrier <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> for providing a rotary seal with the turbine rotor shaft (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Since the inner band and vane segments are uncoupled from the outer band and vane segments at the axial splitline, the support rods <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> structurally couple together the outer and inner vane sections and carry the aerodynamic torque loads of the vane sections to the casing. In an alternate embodiment, the nozzle may instead be supported from the inner band, with the outer band being suitably sealed to the outer casing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the support rod <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> preferably extends downwardly into the inner frame <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> wherein it is surrounded by a compression spring <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> trapped inside the inner frame. A corresponding spring surrounds the lower end of each of the support rods and is compressed during assembly for providing a radially outward compression force for pressing together the radially bifurcated outer and inner vane sections <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. In this way, the axial splitline <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is maintained closed by the spring compression force for maintaining structural continuity of the vane segments. And, the axial splitline is additionally closed by the reduction in static pressure of the combustion gases flowing through the nozzle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the corresponding junctions of the bands and frames include stepped corners for trapping and retaining axially the two bands in the assembled turbine nozzle assembly. The steps in the inner band permit slight radially outward movement of the inner band as the compression springs press the inner sections against the outer sections of the vane pairs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</cross-reference>, an annular outer manifold <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is fixedly joined to the vane forward segments <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> for supporting those segments in front of the corresponding vane aft segments <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The manifold may be formed of any suitable metal in one or more assembled rings from which the several vane forward segments <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are fixedly attached, by brazing for example, for their retention and support during operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Preferably the vane forward segments <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are cantilevered from the outer manifold and terminate at the outer surface of the inner band. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</cross-reference>, each of the forward segments may terminate in a shallow pocket formed in the outer surface of the inner band, or that outer surface may be smooth without pockets if desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Suitable means are provided, including a bleed circuit from the compressor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to the outer manifold <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, for channeling cooling air <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> through the outer manifold and outer frame for cooling the nozzle segments. Suitable apertures <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> are formed through the walls of the outer manifold and outer frame for correspondingly channeling portions of the cooling air inside the forward and aft vane segments for internal cooling thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</cross-reference>, each vane forward segment <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is attached to the common outer manifold <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and has a top inlet through which the cooling air is channeled radially inwardly behind the leading edge of the vane. The forward segment may be closed at its radially inner end, and preferably includes rows of film cooling holes <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> from which the cooling air is discharged from the leading edge portion of the vanes and flows downstream over both pressure and suction sides for external film cooling thereof in a conventional manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the support rod <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> preferably includes external surface grooves extending along the length thereof for channeling a portion of the cooling air from inside the outer frame <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> radially inwardly through the vane bores <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> for internal cooling thereof. The cooling air may be suitably discharged through the inner frame <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, and some of the cooling air may leak through the axial splitline <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> during operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, the vane aft segment <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may also include one or more additional internal flow channels <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> extending in span therethrough, and disposed in flow communication with the inside of the outer frame for receiving the cooling air therefrom. And, a row of discharge holes <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is preferably disposed along the pressure side of the vane near the trailing edge for discharging the cooling air from the corresponding internal flow channel <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The radial and axial splitlines <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> divide each nozzle vane into three parts which collectively define the aerodynamic profile of the vane airfoil yet permit the preferential use of limited metal in the forward segment and monolithic ceramic in the aft segment for reducing cooling air requirements while increasing durability of the hybrid vanes for a suitable useful life in the hostile environment of the turbine nozzle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The axial splitline <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is positioned in span between the two bands near the radial center region of the vanes to substantially reduce the buildup of thermally induced stress due to temperature gradients in the combustion gases. Since the maximum temperature region of the combustion gases is near the midspan of the vanes, the axial splitline is located in this region which may be an exemplary range of about 30 percent B 70 percent of the radial span as measured from the inner band. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the axial splitline <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is inclined radially inwardly in the direction of gas travel toward the vane trailing edge to correspond generally with the inclination of the gas streamlines or isoclines of the corresponding high temperatures of the combustion gases. The axial splitline may be located in radial span, and either cylindrical without inclination or conical with inclination relative to the centerline axis of the engine for reducing thermal stress generated during operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the metal-ceramic hybrid turbine nozzle disclosed above permits a substantial reduction in the cooling air requirements therefor for increasing overall efficiency of the engine, while effecting a turbine nozzle with suitable durability for extended life in a hostile gas turbine engine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> While there have been described herein what are considered to be preferred and exemplary embodiments of the present invention, other modifications of the invention shall be apparent to those skilled in the art from the teachings herein, and it is, therefore, desired to be secured in the appended claims all such modifications as fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention.</paragraph>
