<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to self-inerting fuel processing systems, methods of shutting down such fuel processing systems, and fuel cell electric power generation systems incorporating them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Fuel cell electric power generation systems comprising a fuel cell stack and a fuel processing system for converting a fuel into a hydrogen-rich reformate stream and supplying it to the fuel cell stack can be operated to provide electric power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> On shutdown of such fuel cell electric power generation systems, the fuel processing system and (optionally) the fuel cell stack are typically purged of reactant gases, including residual fuel, reformate and other reaction products. Purging is typically performed using an inert gas stream, such as nitrogen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Purging the anode passages of the fuel cell stack assists in preventing electrochemical reactions from proceeding within the fuel cells on shutdown, such as the generation of water at the cathodes. It also reduces the electric potential of the stack, which may be desirable in some applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Typical fuel processing components in such systems include reformers, such as steam reformers, for example, and may also include shift reactors and/or selective oxidizers. These components are purged to reduce deterioration of the components that can occur when reactant gases are present in them at temperatures below their normal operating temperatures. The presence of reactants at lower temperatures can result in carbon deposition and/or water condensation on the catalyst bed(s) of the component(s) and carbonyl formation, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Conventional fuel cell electric power generation systems typically employ pressurized nitrogen supplied from a nitrogen gas cylinder for purging. This approach undesirably increases the size and weight of the overall electric power generation system and requires maintenance to exchange an empty gas cylinder with a new one. Further, the operating cost of the electric power generation system is increased due to the expense of the inert gas supply. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> As described herein and in the appended claims, fuel means gaseous or liquid fuels comprising aliphatic hydrocarbons and oxygenated derivatives thereof, and may further comprise aromatic hydrocarbons and oxygenated derivatives thereof. Reformate means the gas stream comprising hydrogen produced from a fuel by a fuel processing system or component(s) thereof, including but not limited to reformers, shift reactors, selective oxidizers, one or more sulfur removal apparatus, pressure swing adsorption (&ldquo;PSA&rdquo;) units, or combinations thereof Oxidant means a gas stream comprising inert gas and oxygen, such as air, cathode exhaust gas, burner exhaust gas, or PSA off-gas, for example. PSA off-gas means an inert gas-enriched, oxygen-depleted gas stream produced by a PSA unit. PSA off-gas may be produced by systems such as those described in published PCT Application No. WO 00/16425, for example. Inert gas means an unreactive gas stream comprising nitrogen, helium, or argon, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Reformer means any apparatus suitable for converting a fuel into a reformate stream and includes but is not necessarily limited to steam reformers, partial oxidation reformers, catalytic partial oxidation reformers, autothermal reformers, and plasma reformers. Reformers may be of any suitable construction, such as tubular, shell-and-tube or plate-and-frame, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> A steam reformer is a reformer comprising a steam reforming catalyst bed and a heat transfer surface for transferring the heat supplied by burner combustion gases to the catalyst bed. The burner may be integrated into the steam reformer vessel, or it may be separately housed. Again, the steam reformer may be of any suitable construction, such as shell-and-tube or plate-and-frame, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Catalyst bed&rdquo; comprises the catalyst composition employed in a particular fuel processing component and includes the catalyst bed structure. Suitable catalyst bed structures include particulate catalyst components and monoliths. For example, suitable catalyst bed structures include catalyst components disposed on a pelletized porous support, or disposed on a monolithic porous support, such as ceramic honeycomb or expanded metal foam, for instance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Unless otherwise specified, a shift reactor may have a catalyst bed comprising low-temperature, medium-temperature, or high-temperature shift catalyst compositions, or any combination thereof. For example, a low- or medium-temperature shift catalyst bed may comprise a copper-containing composition such as Cu/Zn oxide shift catalyst, and a high-temperature shift catalyst bed may comprise an iron-containing composition such as Fe/Cr shift catalyst. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> As used herein, when two components are fluidly connected to one another, there may be other components in between them, and the other components may effect the fluid connection but not eliminate it altogether. An open line means a conduit having one end open to air that may be valved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, similar components are given similar reference numbers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a schematic representation of an embodiment of the present self-inerting fuel processing system and fuel cell electric power generation system. During normal operation of fuel processing system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, fuel from fuel source <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is supplied via valve <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to fuel compressor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and is compressed to produce a pressurized fuel stream. Steam from steam supply <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is mixed with the pressurized fuel stream exiting fuel compressor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to produce a reactant stream, which is supplied to fuel processor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Fuel processor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> converts the reactant stream to a reformate stream comprising hydrogen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The reformate stream exiting fuel processor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is then supplied via valve <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to the anodes of fuel cells comprising fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may then generate electricity from the reformate stream. For example, a fuel cell stack such as that disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,484,666, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, may be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The hydrogen-depleted anode exhaust stream exiting from fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is then supplied via valve <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> to burner <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, as valves <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> are typically closed during normal operation of fuel processing system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The anode exhaust stream is combusted within burner <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> to produce a hot burner gas stream that is supplied to fuel processor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and is in heat exchange relationship therewith. The cooled burner exhaust gas is then exhausted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> On shutdown, the flow of fuel from fuel supply <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is interrupted by shutting valve <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and fuel compressor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is stopped. Steam from steam supply <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> then purges fuel processor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. If desired, the steam may also purge reformate from fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> before being vented from the system. Alternatively, valve <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> may be closed and valve <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> opened so that the purged gases will by-pass stack <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> before being vented. As a further alternative, valves <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> may be operated to first by-pass fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and then purge it once the lines upstream of fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> are substantially filled with steam. In this way, it may be possible to reduce the exposure of fuel cell components to potentially detrimental components of the purged gas, such as carbon monoxide, for example, while still purging the stack. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Steam may be supplied to fuel processing system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> until substantially all of the reactants and/or reformate is purged. For example, steam purging could continue until combustion ceases in burner <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, which may be a useful indicator that purging is substantially complete. Other means of determining when the system is substantially purged will be apparent to persons skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Following steam purging, supply of steam to fuel processing system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is interrupted, valve <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> is opened, and fuel compressor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is re-started. As a result, gases present circulate via line <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> through fuel processor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> (and, optionally, through fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>), instead of being vented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> As the temperature of fuel processing system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> decreases and the volume of circulating gases therein also decreases, oxidant (in this case, air) is introduced into line <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> via the exhaust outlet of burner <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and is circulated. At least a portion of the oxygen in the air oxidizes a self-reducing catalyst bed within fuel processor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and is consumed, producing a &ldquo;blanket&rdquo; of inert gas within fuel processing system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. During the cool-down period, fuel compressor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> may be operated continuously or intermittently, as desired. Once the temperature of fuel processing system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> reaches a suitable shutdown temperature, valve <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> may be shut, if desired, to prevent further entry of air into the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Fuel processor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> comprises a suitable reformer for converting a hydrocarbon fuel to a reformate stream comprising hydrogen. Fuel processor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may also comprise other fuel processing components, such as desulfurizers, preoxidizers, shift reactors, PSA units and/or selective oxidizers, for example. Those skilled in the art can select suitable fuel processor components for a given application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The upstream catalyst bed(s) of fuel processor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> should comprise self-reducing catalyst compositions. In this context, &ldquo;self-reducing&rdquo; means the catalyst compositions are capable of being oxidized, thereby consuming oxygen in the oxidant introduced into the system, and of being re-reduced with reformate and/or fuel during start-up. More specifically, a self-reducing catalyst composition has a reduction exothermal temperature rise in the presence of reformate that is less than the difference between the maximum operating temperature for the catalyst and the inlet temperature of the reformate introduced into the catalyst bed that starts the reduction process and the exothermal temperature rise (if any) associated with the other reactions taking place in the bed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> For example, catalyst compositions comprising Cu, Ni, or other metals having different oxidation states, such as Fe, chromia, or ceria, for example, may be suitable self-reducing catalysts. Other catalyst compositions may also be suitable, providing that they meet the criteria for self-reducing catalyst compositions described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Auxiliary beds comprising a self-reducing catalyst bed may also be employed for the purpose of consuming oxygen present in the circulating oxidant during shutdown, if desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The upstream bed(s) of fuel processor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may comprise oxygen-tolerant catalyst compositions. This would allow for catalytic combustion of at least a portion of the oxygen present in the introduced oxidant with fuel and/or hydrogen present in the catalyst bed during the initial phase of shutdown. For example, selective oxidizer catalyst compositions and noble metal reforming catalyst compositions may be employed. In addition, oxygen-tolerant shift catalyst compositions may also be employed, such as bifunctional shift catalysts developed by Argonne National Laboratory (Argonne, Ill., USA) incorporating bimetallic/polymetallic oxide compositions, for example. Suitable metals for use in these catalyst compositions include Pt, Ru, Pd, Pt/Ru, Pt/Cu, Co, Ag, Fe, Cu, and Mo. Suitable metal oxide supports include lanthanide oxides, manganese oxides, vanadium oxide, and mixed metal oxides. (See, for example, Myers et al., &ldquo;Alternative Water-Gas Shift Catalyst Development&rdquo;, in <highlight><italic>Transportation Fuel Cell Power Systems, </italic></highlight>2000 <highlight><italic>Annual Progress Report, </italic></highlight>by U.S. Department of Energy. Washington, D.C., U.S. Department of Energy, October 2000.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a schematic representation of another embodiment of the present self-inerting fuel processing system and fuel cell electric power generation system. During normal operation, fuel processing system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> functions in a manner similar to fuel processing system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, as discussed above, except that the anode exhaust stream from stack <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is not provided to a burner. Note that valve <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> is closed during normal operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> On shutdown, valve <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is closed. With valve <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> closed the operation of fuel compressor <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> causes a reduced pressure in line <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>. In response, oxidant supply <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> introduces oxidant into line <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>. As oxidant introduced into line <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> enters fuel processor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, at least a portion of the oxygen therein is consumed as the upstream catalyst bed(s) thereof are oxidized. Further, where oxygen is present with fuel and/or reformate in the self-reducing catalyst bed, there is the potential for combustion reactions to occur that assist in consuming the oxygen. In addition, where the self-reducing catalyst bed comprises a selective oxidation catalyst &lsqb;or shift catalyst&quest;&rsqb;, at least a portion of hydrogen and carbon monoxide (if any) present may also be consumed. As a result, an inert gas stream is produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The pressurized gas stream exiting fuel compressor <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> then purges fuel processor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. If desired, the gas stream may also purge reformate from fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> before being vented. Alternatively, valve <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> may be closed and valve <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> opened so that the purged gases will by-pass stack <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> before being vented. As a further alternative, valves <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> may be operated to first by-pass fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and then purge it once substantially all of the fuel and/or reformate has been purged from the lines upstream of fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Following purging, valves <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> are closed and valve <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> is opened, allowing the inert gas stream to circulate via line <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> through fuel processor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> As the temperature of fuel processing system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> decreases and the volume of circulating gases therein also decreases, oxidant is introduced into line <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> via oxidant supply <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> and is circulated. Alternatively, valve <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> may be left open after purging and oxidant (air) allowed to enter fuel processing system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> from the resulting open line instead of, or in addition to, oxidant supply <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>. At least a portion of the oxygen in the introduced oxidant oxidizes a self-reducing catalyst bed within fuel processor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and is consumed. During the cool-down period, fuel compressor <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> may be operated continuously or intermittently, as desired. Once the temperature of fuel processing system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> reaches a suitable shutdown temperature, fuel compressor <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> may be stopped and valve <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> closed (if open). </paragraph>

Suitable such components depend on the particular fuel processing system configuration and will be apparent to persons skilled in the art. For example, cathode exhaust, burner exhaust or PSA off-gas will be generated during normal operation of the fuel processing system, but will typically be used as an oxidant only during shutdown. Thus, such oxidants may require more complex valving, connecting lines and/or control systems compared to open lines or check valves for introducing air into the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a schematic representation of another embodiment of the present self-inerting fuel processing system and fuel cell electric power generation system. During normal operation, fuel processing system <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> functions in a manner similar to fuel processing system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, as discussed above. However, in fuel processing system <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, reformate exiting fuel processor <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> enters auxiliary bed <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> comprising a self-reducing catalyst bed, as valve <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> is typically closed during normal operation. The flow of hydrogen through auxiliary bed <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> maintains the self-reducing catalyst bed therein in a reduced state. The reformate stream is then supplied via valve <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> to stack <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. Note also that valve <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight> may be closed during normal operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> On shutdown, the flow of fuel from fuel supply <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> may be interrupted by shutting valve <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. Fuel compressor <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> is stopped and valve <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> may be closed. Valve <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> is opened (as is valve <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight>, if closed), valves <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> are closed, and recycle compressor <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> is started. Oxidant is introduced via oxidant supply <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> to auxiliary bed <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> and at least a portion of the oxygen present is consumed therein. The gas stream exiting auxiliary bed <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> then flows through line <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> before being supplied to recycle compressor <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> as an inert gas stream. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The pressurized gas stream exiting recycle compressor <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> then purges fuel processor <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and is vented via the exhaust outlet of burner <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight>. Venting could continue until combustion ceases in burner <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight>, for example, which may be a useful indicator that the purge gas is sufficiently inert. Valve <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> could then be closed, valve <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> opened, and the inert gas stream recycled through the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the purge gas could simply be recycled without venting by leaving valve <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> closed. Catalytic combustion reactions may reduce or eliminate any residual fuel and/or reformate in the purge gas, as discussed above. Whether the purge gas could be recycled without venting will depend on, among other things, the relative amounts of residual fuel and/or reformate present, the amount of oxygen present in the oxidant, and the nature of the self-reducing catalyst bed(s), and the rate of cooling of the fuel processing system. Such variables are system-dependent and whether the purge gas may be recycled without venting in a particular system may be readily determined by persons skilled in the art. </paragraph>
