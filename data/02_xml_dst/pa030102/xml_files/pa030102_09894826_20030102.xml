<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A system and method are provided for ensuring increased accuracy of individual relays (e.g., within a control system comprising a sensor) to close substantially coincidentally with respect to a current zero-crossing of an incoming power supply waveform. To determine timing of contact operation, a microcontroller operates the contacts in response to one of a series of test pulses, and determines the amount of time required for contact operation. The difference between timing of contact operation and zero-crossing is determined and adjusted to offset errors incurred by microcontroller threshold variations and power supply voltage variations. The calibrated value is then provided to the sensor in order to extend sensor life. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to a system and method for calibrating contact operation time of a relay that is substantially coincident with a current zero-crossing of an input power signal. More particularly, the present invention relates to calibrating the contact closure times of each of a number of individual relays, and storing the calibration factor of a selected relay within the microprocessor of a sensor which employs the selected relay, to ensure contact closure at substantially the current zero-crossing of the input power supply. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Many commercial, industrial, and government facilities requite a significant number of lighting fixtures for adequate illumination, and therefore use a significant amount of power to operate the fixtures. To reduce the power consumed to light these facilities, a number of lighting control systems are used which employ sensors to automatically and selectively power the light fixtures on and off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The sensors generally employ relays in order to control the supply of power to the light fixture, depending on room occupancy and time of day, among other factors. The sensor life can be greatly extended if the relay contacts close at substantially a current zero-crossing of the input power signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In order to facilitate the coincidental timing of the contact closure with zero-crossing, various errors need to be calibrated. These errors can include, for example, a relay-dependent variation in time between initiating contact closure and actual contact closure, depending on variation in power supply voltage from a nominal power supply. In other words, there are unit-to-unit variations among multiple relays with respect to the time that elapses between the input signal energizing a relay drive circuit and actual contact closure. Relay energization time variations can be as much as &plusmn;0.42 milliseconds (msec.) with a nominal supply voltage of 13.9 VDC. Additionally, an error of as much as &plusmn;0.48 msec. results from the power supply variation. For example, the range for power supply variations is from 12.6 VDC to 15.1 VDC, nominal and non-nominal, respectively. An additional error (e.g., as much as &plusmn;0.24 msec.) results from microcontroller threshold changes due to microcontroller activation time variations. The above-mentioned errors (e.g., microcontroller threshold variation errors, relay energization time errors, and power supply voltage variation) are cumulative and fixed for a single sensor. The calibration of all three of these errors would greatly increase the life of the relay, and therefore the sensor. Thus, a need exists for a method of calibrating the relay contact closure point on a per-relay basis such that contact closure is substantially coincidental with a current zero-crossing of an input power signal regardless of microcontroller threshold variation errors, relay energization time errors, and power supply voltage variation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, the combinations of various power supplies, microprocessors or microcontrollers and associated relays present unique errors. Accordingly, conventional methods of calibrating multiple relays (e.g., an entire lot of relays during their manufacture) with the offset timing error from one relay does not compensate for the error contributed by each relay which, as discussed above, can vary greatly and therefore shorten the sensor life. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The present invention overcomes the deficiencies of existing relays within control systems and realizes a number of advantages over conventional relay-operated control systems. A system is provided in accordance with the present invention that calibrates offset error for individual relays and stores the offset error of a particular relay in, for example, the microcontroller of a sensor within a control system (e.g. in a lighting control system) to facilitate contact operation at substantially the current zero-crossing of an input power signal. A method is provided for deploying a plurality of relays in respective control systems (e.g., sensors for light fixtures) which comprises testing contacts of respective relays, storing the corresponding calibrated contact operation times in a memory device, and transferring each of the offset times to a processing device such as the memory (e.g., EEPROM) provided within a microcontroller for the respective control device in which the corresponding relay is deployed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides a method for determining timing of contact operation of a relay. The method comprises generating a relay test request signal, for example, a plurality of pulses occurring in a pre-determined pattern (e.g., at substantially the current zero-crossing), initiating operation of the contacts of the relay in response to one of the pulses, and determining the amount of time required for contact operation in response to the pulse (e.g., the time difference between zero-cross and contact closure). The method comprises determining whether the amount of time for the relay to operate is greater than the time between the pulses, and storing the amount of time for the relay to operate in a memory device if the amount of time for the relay to operate is less than the time between pulses. A microcontroller or other processing device can be programmed to employ the time difference as a calibration factor to be added to or subtracted from the time when a non-calibrated relay control signal initiates the contacts. The calibration factor can also take into account variations associated with the power supply and the processing device (e.g., processing time corresponding to relay control operations). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides an apparatus for testing contact operation of a relay within a control system. The apparatus comprises a memory device and a processing device, such as a microcontroller containing an EEPROM, operable to store an amount of time corresponding to the time needed to enable the relay contacts to operate, as well as an interface circuit between the control system and the processing device. During relay production, the control system is coupled to the apparatus via the interface circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, the control system employs a microcontroller with a calibrated value of the contact operation time corresponding to the particular relay, power supply, and the microcontroller, which is employed by a relay-operated sensor within the control system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, the calibrated value of the contact operation time corresponds to the offset timing of contact operation compared to the zero-crossing of the incoming power signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In accordance with yet another aspect of the invention, the offset of contact operation time compared to a zero-crossing is measured several times, and the average value is then provided into the microcontroller or other processing device of the control system.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> An exemplary control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for use in conjunction with the present invention is depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be used with a number of different loads such as HVAC, security, and temperature control systems. The control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the illustrated embodiment is implemented, for example, with lighting fixtures for illustrative purposes. The control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is secured to a wall <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at a height selected to enable the sensor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> within the control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to detect when an occupant <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is walking in proximity of the sensor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. As will be described below, the control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> facilitates the automatic powering up and down of lighting fixtures <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which are typically mounted overhead to a ceiling <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a block diagram of the sensor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. A power source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> provides varying voltages to a relay drive circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and an electronic circuit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, for operation of a load <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The load <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, for example, is a light fixture, a security system, or a thermostat, as mentioned above. The electronic circuit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> preferably comprises a microcontroller <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, a photocell <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and a pyro-electric detector <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The photocell <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> provides the sensor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> with light sensitivity operations, whereas pyro-electric detector <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> provides information regarding room occupancy (e.g., motion sensing) in a conventional manner. The microcontroller <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> facilitates closing the contacts <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of the relay drive circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> substantially coincidentally with the zero-crossing of an input power signal. In accordance with the present invention, a processing device, such as a microprocessor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, measures offset timing for contact closure to be substantially coincident with a zero-crossing for individual relays (e.g., relay <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>) and provides this calibrated value to the EEPROM of the microcontroller <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, for example. Accordingly, the relay drive circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> closes the contacts <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> upon signaling from the microcontroller <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> which employs the calibrated contact closure time. The calibrated value accounts for such factors as processor reaction time to implement the calibrated value, an individual relay reaction or contact closure time, and power supply voltage variations, among other factors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In addition, the sensing circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> preferably has a total field of view of approximately 170 degrees, and an adjustable coverage depth between 13 and 32 feet for an occupant working in a 280 to 800 square foot area. The presence of an occupant can be detected using a number of different techniques such as measuring changes in the amount of energy measured by a detector, detecting the breaking of an optical beam or a temperature differential. Accordingly, in operation, when the photo-cell and pyroelectric detectors <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, respectively, measure a change in the amount of energy in the room, the microcontroller <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> determines if the amount of change is sufficient to enable or disable the load <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. If the amount of change is sufficient, the microcontroller <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> initiates the contacts <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of a relay <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to either close or open, depending upon the occupancy of the room. The microcontroller <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> enables the contacts <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> according to the calibrated contact closure time stored in the EEPROM of microcontroller <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. This calibration time has been determined in accordance with the present invention for the particular relay <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, power supply <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and microcontroller <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> employed within the sensor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> such as during manufacture of the relay <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, the electronic circuit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> uses the photo-cell detector <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the pyro-electric detector <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> for adaptive timing. Alternatively, the sensor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can be provided with a potentiometer as a fixed timing mechanism. The fixed timing embodiment generally requires the use of a screwdriver or other tool to manually adjust ambient light settings, for example. In addition, this type of control system generally requires calibration of the light sensing device during factory testing. This is in contrast to the adaptive timing mechanism, as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, which monitors a number of functions (e.g., usage pattern of room, and daylight hours) and automatically adjusts the delay time for powering on or off the associated load <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> accordingly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The system employed in accordance with the present invention to program the microcontroller <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the electronic circuit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. For exemplary purposes, the sensor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> employing an adaptive timing mechanism is shown; however, a sensor employing a potentiometer can be used. The sensor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> comprising relay <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is coupled to a microprocessor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> via an interface circuit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> that comprises a zero-cross detection circuit and is depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. Accordingly, the microprocessor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is provided with test software <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> that determines the offset time between the current zero-crossing of the input power supply and the operation of the relay <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. This calibration value <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is shown on display <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and then programmed into, for example, the EEPROM, of microcontroller <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> via a keyboard <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. This calibration value <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is unique for each relay and can vary from as little as &plusmn;0.42 msec. to as much as &plusmn;0.48 msec., depending upon the relay. The calibration value <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> can also vary for each associated microcontroller and power supply. For example, the microcontroller <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> threshold time variation for a nominal power supply of 0.94 V at 120 V Line is preferably &plusmn;0.24 msec. Power supplies that are nominal have an average expected voltage, while non-nominal power supplies have a greater or less than expected voltage. Thus, depending upon the voltage of the power supply <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the microcontroller <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, the relay <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> can have varying operational times. As stated above, the ability to calibrate the relay <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> such that the contact operation time substantially coincides with zero-crossing thereby extends contact life. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The test software <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> will now be described with reference to the flow chart in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The dotted line box <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> depicts functional testing of the various components of the sensor such as electronic circuit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, the power supply <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and the relay drive circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Upon completion of the functional testing of these various components, the microprocessor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> begins calibration of the sensor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. With reference to block <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the relay is set and reset a number of times (e.g., three times) to ensure a reliable reading of the contact operation times. As will be described below, each relay is tested multiple times, and the response times therefor are averaged, before entering a calibration offset value into a microprocessor such as the microprocessor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Setting and resetting the relays can be accomplished, for example, via a pogo pin input or a front press switch input to the microcontroller <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The microcontroller <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> monitors the zero-crossing of the input power signal to begin the calibration process. In production, factory personnel depress a front press switch which is provided as an input to the microcontroller <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, resulting in a similar input to test the relay <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Once the sensor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is deployed in a control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, however, the microcontroller <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is programmed to generate its own test. Upon commencement of a calibration cycle, the microcontroller <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> commences generating a pre-determined sequence of pulses. For example, the microcontroller <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> can generate pulses of 0.2 seconds in duration which occur every 0.6 seconds. The microprocessor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, as explained below in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, measures certain events with respect to these pulses to obtain a calibration value <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The reaction time for the microcontroller <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> can be 0.1 msec. This reaction time is variable between relays, and is among the factors to be calibrated out by the microcontroller <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in accordance with the present invention. Thus, the time between pulses is effectively, 0.5 msec., for example, and the contact operation time is greater than or equal to 0.5 msec., the contact <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is calibrated to eliminate the offset error in order for the contact operation to be substantially coincidental with a zero-crossing (block <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>), as described below in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. If the contact operation timing is less than 0.5 msec., then the microprocessor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> that is testing the contact operation performs no calibration, and testing proceeds with the next relay. With reference to block <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, calculation of the timing offset for the contacts <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> to be substantially coincident with zero-crossing is performed as described in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> below. The microprocessor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is held in reset mode while factory personnel program the EEPROM of microcontroller <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> with the calibration value <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> obtained during testing, as shown in block <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> With reference to block <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, a 55 second wait time is preferably provided for re-testing of the contacts <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> because resetting microprocessor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> requires restarting the software <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to ensure contact closure is coincident with the zero-crossing. Also, the 55 second wait time is software-controlled by microprocessor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to allow warm up of analog circuitry of sensor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> when power is initially applied. With reference to block <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, another pair of relay pulses are generated for one cycle of 1.2 seconds, for example. This second check of the same relay <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> ensures an accurate calibration reading. With reference to block <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, the timing of contact <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> operation and the current zero-crossing are compared to ensure that the two events are within one pulse cycle or 0.5 msec. of one another. If the calibration time is within 0.5 msec., microprocessor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> tests another relay (block <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>). If the calibration time is greater than 0.5 msec. (block <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>), then another attempt at re-calibration is made or testing of the functional components of the sensor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is performed to ensure the integrity of the sensor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a schematic diagram of the interface unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> which couples the sensor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> comprising relay <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to the microprocessor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> in order to calibrate any offset error from the contact activation time to the zero-crossing of the input power signal. In operation, the microprocessor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> coordinates the relay <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> activation time with the detected zero-crossing times of the 60 Hz AC power supply <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the sensor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and accounts for delays associated with a number of devices, as mentioned above. For example, the relay <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> requires approximately 0.48 milliseconds, as described above, to initiate in response to a command by the microcontroller <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> due to detection of light or movement by sensor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Once a current zero-crossing is detected by means of the current zero-crossing detection circuit <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the microprocessor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> adds or subtracts the delay associated with the relay <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> from the next zero-crossing (which occurs, for example, at 8 and 16 milliseconds within a full cycle of a 60 Hz signal) to ensure that the contact opens at a substantially zero current level point in the power supply waveform. As stated above, operating the relay <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> substantially coincidentally with a zero-crossing of the power supply <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> increases contact life. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The microprocessor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is coupled to the interface <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> via output <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. The interface circuit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> comprises four circuit components (<highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>) which facilitate timing of current zero-crossing and activation of the relays of the sensor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The first circuit component <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> is a power supply circuit that preferably provides &plus;5 V to the NAND gate <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of circuit component <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>. Circuit component <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is also a power supply circuit preferably providing &plus;5 V to the NAND gate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of circuit component <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. Circuit component <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> is a current zero-cross detection circuit for the power supply <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the sensor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Circuit component <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is a contact operation detection circuit. The output of circuit components <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> are compared to determine the offset timing between contact <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> operation and a current zero-crossing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> To facilitate a physical connection between the sensor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the interface circuit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, three wires (i.e., a positive, negative, and neutral wires) are preferably provided. The positive lead (e.g., a black wire) is coupled to the input <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of the third circuit component <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> of the interface <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. The negative lead (e.g. a red wire) is coupled to the input <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> of the fourth circuit component <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> of the interface <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. The neutral lead (e.g., a green wire) is coupled to input <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, but in another embodiment of the present invention, can also be coupled to the ground input <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The first circuit component <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> of the interface circuit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> provides &plus;5 V to the first NAND gate <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the second circuit component <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> of the interface circuit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> via output <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight>. The second circuit component <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> of the interface circuit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> provides the microprocessor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> with the timing information relating to current zero-crossing to facilitate calibrating contact activation. Thus, as the input power supply waveform passes through a zero-crossing point, the output of circuit component <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> outputs a negative pulse. The negative pulses are generated via a bridge full-wave rectifier <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, a zener diode <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, the NAND gate <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, and an optocoupler <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The bridge full-wave rectifier <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> rectifies the input power signal. The bridge <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is preferably employed as a positive rectifier. The output signal from the bridge <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is then clipped at the zener diode <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> at its breakdown voltage of &plus;6.2 V. The output signal from the zener diode <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is then inverted by the NAND gate <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and provided to the optocoupler <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, which generates a series of negative pulses each time the incoming current passes a zero-crossing point. The optocoupler <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> provides an electrically isolated signal coupled between a photo-transistor and an LED. The LED emits light when current passes through the phototransistor which generates a signal upon receiving light from the LED. The phototransistor emits an inverted signal as the output of optocoupler <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, these negative or inverted pulses are transmitted to the microprocessor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> via output <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The third circuit component <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> of the interface <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> supplies power to the NAND gate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of the fourth circuit component <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. The microprocessor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> evaluates preferably two conditions in accordance with the present invention. The first condition is whether the incoming signal is essentially away from a zero-crossing point, and the second condition is whether the incoming signal is essentially at a zero-crossing point. If the incoming signal is not at a zero-crossing, then a positive signal is input to bridge full-wave rectifier <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The bridge <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> rectifies the signal, which is then provided to the zener diode <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> having an associated breakdown voltage of 6.2 V. The signal is then clipped at 6.2 V, as can be appreciated by one skilled in the art. The NAND gate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, powered by the third circuit component <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> of the interface circuit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> as mentioned above, inverts the signal to cause the output <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> of NAND gate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to be low. The optocoupler <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> then converts the signal to a high state, thereby maintaining the output <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> of the fourth circuit component <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> in a high state. This signal is then transmitted to the microprocessor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to determine the time difference between the high state on output <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, and the low state on output <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> due to the negative pulses, as mentioned above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> If the incoming current is at the zero-crossing point and the contacts are closed, (e.g., zero incoming current), the input to the NAND gate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is low, in contrast to high input to the NAND gate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> when the incoming power signal is away from a zero-crossing. The low signal at the NAND gate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is inverted and is therefore high at the output on NAND gate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The inverted signal is transmitted to the optocoupler <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> which again inverts the signal to low. Accordingly, the input to NAND gate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is high if the contacts operate away from a zero-crossing, and the input is low if the contacts operate at a zero-crossing. Therefore, the output <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> is high when the contacts operate away from the zero-cross and low when the contacts operate at a zero-crossing. Accordingly, the microprocessor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> can distinguish between the incoming current being at or away from a zero-crossing, and adjust the required offset timing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> It is to be understood that an embodiment of the present invention can be implemented as shown in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. In addition, another embodiment of the present invention can employ semiconductor components, as opposed to mechanical or electromechanical relays. For example, a switching-type of semiconductor is preferably used such as a triac or SCR component. A gating signal is provided that controls the rectification in the interface circuit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> in a conventional manner. For example, the gating signal operates similar to the relay drive circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> in that, once the component is turned on via the gate signal, it remains on even after removal of the initial current upon condition of a minimal current maintained in the rectifying circuit, as can be appreciated by one skilled in the art. However, a lighting system employing a relay is preferable, as embodied in the present invention, due to the fact that a relay dissipates less power than a semiconductor device. Accordingly, a sensor employing semiconductor devices employs additional components to dissipate the excess heat generated by the devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a timing diagram illustrating the signal timing to operate contacts <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in response to sensor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Microcontroller <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> monitors the current zero-crossing <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> which occurs every half-cycle of an AC sinusoid, or 8.33 ms. The exploded view <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> of current zero-crossing <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> details at <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>B the current zero-cross level for a microcontroller (e.g., microcontroller <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>) employing a nominal and non-nominal power supply, respectively, as mentioned above. Points <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>B illustrate the variation in timing of current zero-crossing for individual relays employing nominal and non-nominal components and are provided to microcontroller <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> via tests from microprocessor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

Waveform <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> represents the current zero-cross error incurred by the power supply <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, as measured by microprocessor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, in addition to the time delay caused by the software in microcontroller <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to recognize the hardware input by the sensor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Waveform <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> represents the time required for the microcontroller <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to initiate the relay drive circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to close contacts <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. In other words, the software requires an activation time to close the contacts <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> at the current zero-crossing. The software adjusts time T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to account for the activation time, and generates a set pulse, with the cumulative offset error, to activate the circuit components that are used to close the contacts <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> at the current zero-crossing. Accordingly, waveform <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> indicates the set pulse by the microcontroller <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> indicating operation of contacts <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
