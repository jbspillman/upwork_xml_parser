<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to wireless digital communication systems, and in particular to microcellular packet communication systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> As personal wireless communication systems such as in cellular telephony proliferate, the spectrum available to the wireless user for accessing cell sites for interactive communication becomes premium. There is great pressure to shrink the cell size of cellular telephone systems, for example, in order to promote frequency reuse and ultimately increase user density and capacity, as well as to reduce the required transmitter power for battery-operated portables. This is part of the trend toward so-called microcellular systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> An example of such a microcellular system is U.S. Pat. No. 5,515,369 entitled &ldquo;Method For Frequency Sharing And Frequency Punchout In Frequency Hopping Communications Network&rdquo; inventor George Flammer, III, et. al. issued May 7, 1996, (herein &ldquo;Flammer&rdquo;) which is herein incorporated by reference. Flammer describes a wireless packet communication system having a plurality of nodes, each having a transmitter and a receiver, the receiver at each node is assigned a seed value and is provided with a channel punchout mask, i.e., channel mask. A node uses its seed value and channel mask to generate a specific randomly ordered channel hopping band plan on which to receive signals. A node transmits its seed value and channel mask to target nodes with which it wants to establish communication links, and those target nodes each use the seed value and channel mask to generate the randomly ordered channel hopping band plan for that node. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> As the size of cells decreases and the need for mobility of subscriber units increases, the need for reliable and seamless communication between mobile subscriber units and cell sites increases. In a data communication system such as a wireless mesh network, a subscriber unit moving at a rate of 70 mph would transit cells set on one-quarter mile centers in about 13 seconds. While 13 seconds is adequate time to exchange a substantial amount of data, the acquisition time to establish communication between a subscriber unit and a cell site can frequently exceed 13 seconds. Hence communications between mobile subscriber unit and a series of cell sites can fail altogether. What is needed is a protocol, which promotes reliable acquisition and communication of mobile subscriber units in a microcellular environment. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, in a wireless communication system having sometimes mobile subscriber units and a plurality of fixed network devices located at cell sites, such as microcellular sites, a multimode acquisition protocol is provided at each subscriber unit which first senses whether the subscriber unit is static or mobile from the nature and quality of the communication links with nearby network devices and then enables an acquisition protocol suited to either static mode or mobile mode. In a specific embodiment, the protocol initiates procedures to change acquisition mode from static to mobile upon failure of the subscriber unit to sense three consecutive scheduled polling packets sent by a linked network device or upon loss of communication with any locally-known network device or upon failure to transmit 25 consecutive data packets. In such case, the procedure is initiated to determine whether it is appropriate to switch to a mobile mode for purposes of acquisition. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> microcellular network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having network devices <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and mobile subscriber units <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> or user systems <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>, which include packet terminal node controller-equipped transceivers <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and typically a user terminal device <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>, which includes a processor and a memory (not shown), for example, a Personal Computer (PC), Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), mobile telephone or laptop/notebook computer. The user systems may communicate over conventional wired telecommunication lines <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> with other like devices, e.g., a PC <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> having a modem <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, connected to a central office switch <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. Trunk terminals or concentrators <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> may provide the interface to the telephone lines <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight>. In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, the microcellular wireless system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> employs a plurality of fixed site repeaters <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> to capture the signals of the transceivers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> An illustrative example is useful in understanding an embodiment of the invention. A mobile transceiver node equipped vehicle <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> originates a message comprising a sequence of message segments; such as a self-contained digitized message segment A in packet format (with address header, etc.) on a frequency F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Because it is in packet format, the message segment A is essentially self-contained and includes in its header the information needed to address it to a local destination and to an ultimate destination, namely, a number of fixed site repeaters <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and ultimately another terminal, such as mobile transceiver node <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>. The message A is sent to one or more fixed site repeaters <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> known to the mobile transceiver <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, targeted in a sequence of directed acknowledgeable message segments via a communication link maintained between the terminal <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and each of the various repeaters <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, each having a different local address. Imbedded within the fixed site repeaters are controllers <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>183</bold></highlight> for responding to, readdressing and distributing the packets containing message segment A received from the mobile transceiver <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The message segment A is relayed according to the embodiment under supervision of the controllers <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>183</bold></highlight> by the fixed site repeaters <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> following receipt of the message segment originating at terminal <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> on the same frequency F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the message segment A addressed initially for example to fixed site repeater <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> being readdressed and relayed to fixed site repeater <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, and only one message segment A from fixed site relay <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> being readdressed to a fixed site relay, such as relay <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. The message segment A is captured by relay <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and relayed through telephone lines, if needed, to another relay <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>, which transmits the readdressed message segment A on frequency F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from its relay station to the fixed site repeater <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. The message segment A is then directed by fixed site repeater <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> on frequency F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the ultimate destination transceiver terminal <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In a similar manner, a message segment B from transceiver <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> on frequency F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is relayed through each of repeaters <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, also on frequency F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, to the relay <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> by which means of the concentrator <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> and the central switch <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> it is relayed to PC <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> via modem <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> One of the goals for mobility in a microcellular data network (MCDN) system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to the invention is to be able to deliver 28.8 kbps while mobile in 80% of the test sites in the field. In order to be able to do so, it is necessary to make certain enhancements to a normally fixed node system, particularly in the subscriber device protocol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> A subscriber device can be in two distinct states: static (not moving) or mobile (moving). A transition mechanism is provided to switch from one state to the other. Such mechanism detects if the subscriber device is currently moving or if it is static. Subscriber devices are by default set in static state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, each radio or MCDN device, whether at a wired access point (WAP) <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, at a totally wireless poletop <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> or in a mobile subscriber unit <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> or fixed/portable subscriber unit <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, has a data and code structure, made up of components called herein MCELLs <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. An MCELL has a data structure which holds all of the band independent information about an MCDN device. A collection of MCELLs corresponds to the set of communication links of the subscriber unit <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to other subscriber units, also called MCDN devices. Each link is a direct connection on a band. Each MCELL <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> has at least a MAC address <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> and a name <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. The MCELLs are stored in a free MCELL queue <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>. The MCELL structure is used by the router (L3) and above. Where an active link exists, a copy of the corresponding MCELL is stored in an active MCELL queue <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> For each active MCELL <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> there is a corresponding NODE <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> on that band. A node <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> according to the invention and as used herein is a data structure which stores all of the band-dependent information about a direct link. Specifically, each node <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> has a MAC address <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> corresponding to a respective MCELL <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, a try counter <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> and channel measures <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> for the link. The node <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> stores all of the timing information needed to target another MCDN device sharing the band of interest, along with other band dependent information. For each active node <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, there is a corresponding active link referenced in the corresponding MCELL <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The MCELLs <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> together store (contain) all of the band-independent information for its own MCDN device <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and other MCDN devices within its local region. The nodes <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> are stored in a free nodes queue <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and replicated in an active nodes queue <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> wherever the corresponding MCELL <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is in the active MCELL queue. <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> During signal acquisition from other MCDN devices, the local MCDN device <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> collects some of the MCELL information directly from the remote MCDN devices as it is passed through it while other MCELL information which is specific to each remote MCDN device is generated locally from signal analysis or reports from other sources. Later, during maintenance, it is regularly updated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Network devices typically broadcast heartbeat packets every 30 seconds as an economical mechanism to provide maintenance information to the radios. Typically the MCELL information of the eight best MCDN devices so acquired are placed in the active MCELL queue <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>. Each node <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> increments its &ldquo;try&rdquo; counter <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> whenever there is a failed transmission from the local node <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. The &ldquo;try&rdquo; counter <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is reset to zero whenever there is a successful exchange. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In addition to the active-node queue <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, each subscriber unit <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> selects the two &ldquo;strongest&rdquo; nodes and stores them in a two element array, called herein the strongest-node array <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>. The local subscriber unit <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> selects the best among the eight, called Best MCELL (BMC) <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, to which to initially route its outgoing packets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> 1. Detecting Mobility </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Referring also to the flow diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, if a subscriber unit <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> in static state misses three consecutive heartbeats from any of those MCDN devices for which the link has an MCELL, or if it loses any of its MCELL information or experiences twenty-five (or another preselected number of) consecutive failures of L3 level routed packets or makes twenty-five consecutive attempts to any MCDN device identified by its MCELL/node <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> on its active MCELL queue <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>/active-node queue <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> (Step A), it performs a moving check test (Step B) on the two strongest nodes <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> to see if itself is moving or not. If the subscriber device <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> has heard from either of the MCDN devices of the two strongest nodes, i.e., a heartbeat or a complete packet, in the specified interval, it will remain in the static state. If not (Step C), then the subscriber device will transition to the lower speed, trimmed down mobile state, removing all MCELL information entries from its MCELL queue structure and executing fast acquisition (Step D). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Whenever a heartbeat is received, a subscriber device <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> will check to see if its BMC <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> has been known for more than eight (or other preselected number of) minutes (Step E). If this is the case, it will switch back to static state (Step F), where it can take advantage of the inherently better performance available in the static state. Otherwise, it stays in mobile state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Subscriber devices change their behavior according to their state. In static state, subscriber devices <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> try to remain with their BMC <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> as long as possible. In mobile state, the subscriber devices <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> switch their BMCs more often and issue more sync packets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> 2. Mobile State </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> When a subscriber device <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> is in motion, the amount of time that it can use a BMC <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is limited by the range covered by the BMC. In the worst case it will be able to remain in the coverage area of a BMC <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> for only 400 meters (0.25 miles) in a typical MCDN environment. At 110 km/h (70 mph) a subscriber device <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> must detect the degradation of the current BMC <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and thus initiate a switch to a new BMC <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> in just thirteen seconds. Therefore, in a mobile state, the best node qualification, registration and third party query processes are turned off (Steps G, H and I). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> 3. Acquisition of New Nodes in Mobile Mode </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> When a subscriber device transitions from the static state into the mobile state, it begins with the acquisition of new radios (MCDN devices and corresponding MCELLs). It removes all the MCELL entries and performs a fast acquisition process in hopes of acquiring new MCELLS around it (Step D). During the mobile state, the subscriber devices transmit 40 sync packets (approximately 400 ms), and waits from 1 s to 2 s maximum between sync packet groups. This entire sequence is the Sync Interval or FastAcq Duration, and it is illustrated in the timeline of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Each such Sync Interval lasts for 15 seconds (Step J). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> There is a delay between sync packets which allows network devices to transmit sync responses. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> timer is set (Step K) to wake up at the end of each Sync Interval, which is typically 15 seconds, to check if it has acquired any MCELLs to use as its current BMC (Step L). If this is the case it will stop the fast acquisition procedure (Step M) and resume normal operation. If on the other hand, no node has been found that can be used as its BMC, the subscriber device repeats the Sync Interval up to five times (Step N). In the worst case this procedure takes around seventy-five seconds. If, after five rounds of Sync Intervals, the subscriber device still cannot find any BMC, it will stop sending out sync packets. At this stage the modem is assumed to be out of the coverage area. Therefore, it is useless to send out sync signals, so they are curtailed to conserve the battery life of the mobile modem. The modem then relies on the Best MCELL timer, which wakes up every 10 minutes to look for Best MCELLs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> When a subscriber device fails eight consecutive times to communicate with its selected best node, it will remove all the MCELLs on its MCELL Active Queue and go into fast acquisition mode. There is no Best Node Qualification Process in the mobile state. As described above, the modem sends out a burst of sync signals, waits and then sends out another burst of sync signals and waits. If at any time at the end of each sync interval an MCELL is acquired, the modem terminates fast acquisition and starts to use that MCELL as its BMC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Whenever a subscriber unit changes its BMC, it must perform a number of procedures. The subscriber unit modem sends forwarding packets to the former bestnode, and updates its new path to the Gateway. Again, during the mobile state, the modem does not re-register with the name server (not shown) when it changes its BMC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> 5. Best MCELL Timer in Mobile State </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> During the mobile state, the Best MCELL timer is not used much. Instead a different timer deals with the bestnode. Whenever a layer 3 routing (L3) packet (a packet which has layer 3 information for routing) is transmitted, the subscriber device starts a timer (four seconds). This timer is meant to keep track of the bestnode to see if it is still present. When the timer is expired, the modem tries to re-qualify its bestnode. This mobile timer helps when the modem is waiting for data from its bestnode. Since it is assumed to be moving away from its bestnode at all times, the timer tells the modem when the modem can no longer talk to its bestnode. When the modem sees that its bestnode is no longer good (by failing eight (typically) consecutive times to communicate with its bestnode), it initiates fast acquisition and performs all the necessary acquisition activities. Whenever the user is out of coverage, the best MCELL (BMC) link is employed. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Each time a heartbeat is heard from any node on the active-node queue, the modem checks to see if it has known its bestnode for more than eight minutes (Step L, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). If this is true, the modem reverts to static state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The various protocols associated with a potentially mobile subscriber unit have now been explained and the invention has been explained with reference to specific embodiments. Other embodiments will be evident to those of ordinary skill in the art. It is therefore not intended that this invention be limited, except as indicated by the appended claims. </paragraph>
