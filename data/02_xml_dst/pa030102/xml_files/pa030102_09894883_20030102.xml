<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a charging system, and more particularly to a charging system for portable equipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A state where a portable telephone is being charged by a prior-art contactless charging system based on electromagnetic induction, is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The portable telephone <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> includes a secondary side coil <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, while a charger <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> includes a primary side coil <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. A user sets the portable telephone <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on the charger <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> as shown in the figure and charges it for a predetermined time period when the remaining battery capacity of the portable telephone <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has become small, or when the portable telephone <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is not used for a long time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> With the prior-art charging system as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, however, there is a spacing <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> between the primary side coil <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the secondary side coil <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and induction cores <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are kept apart, so that problems as mentioned below have been involved: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> 1. Since both the portable equipment and the charger need to include the cores made of a magnetic material such as metal, the weight and size of the portable equipment are increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> 2. Since the primary side coil and the secondary side coil are separate, even a very small deviation in the relative position between the coils exerts influence on a charging efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> 3. When a coin or an accessory article is accidentally held in the charger, a metal generates heat due to an induction current and forms the cause of a fire. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> 4. Since the charger is designed in adaptation to the geometries of the portable equipment, no charger can cope with a plurality of sorts of portable equipment. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Now, an embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a view showing a state where a charging system in the embodiment of the present invention is used, while <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is an enlarged view of the interior of the charging system in the embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> wall <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is erected perpendicularly to a floor <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> (the ground), and a charger body <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> in which a primary side coil <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and a power feed portion <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) are included is attached to the wall <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. An induction core <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> stretches in the shape of a hook from the charger body <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, and penetrates through the primary side coil <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> inside the charger body <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. The induction core <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> stretching from the charger body <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> can suspend a portable telephone <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> and another portable equipment <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> through charging arches <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. Here, the charger body <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> includes a fixation member for fixing this body to the wall <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. The portable telephone <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> and the other portable equipment <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> are suspended from the induction core <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> for a predetermined time period, whereby batteries built in the equipment <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> can be charged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The interior of the portable telephone <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, as well as a charging device (<highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>), is shown as an enlarged view in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. A secondary side coil <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> is disposed on the side of the portable telephone <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>, and it is connected with a rechargeable battery (the built-in battery) <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>. The induction core <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> penetrates through the secondary side coil <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. From this fact, it is understood that the secondary side coil <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> exists in an annular space which is defined by the charging arch <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and a part under this arch <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, a dotted line <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> indicates part of the charging device which is included inside the charger body <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The primary side coil <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is connected with the power feed portion <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, and the induction core <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is mounted so as to penetrate through the primary side coil <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. When an AC voltage is applied from the power feed portion <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> in this state, a magnetic flux is generated in the induction core <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, and a voltage is induced across the secondary side coil <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> by the action of electromagnetic induction, so that the charging of the battery <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> is initiated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> While the embodiment of the present invention has been described above, advantages listed below are brought forth by the present invention: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> 1. The portable equipment can be made smaller in size and lighter in weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> 2. Since the induction core extends from the primary side coil over to the secondary side coil, a stable charging efficiency can be attained by hanging the portable equipment on the charging hook. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> 3. It is not apprehended by way of example that a small metal piece will accidentally enter the cradle portion of a charger, thereby to cause a fire. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> 4. The single charger can cope with the plurality of sorts of portable equipment, and can also charge a plurality of portable equipment simultaneously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> 5. The charger is suited to the attachment on a wall surface, and the required space of the charging system can be saved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> 6. A charging connection portion need not be provided unlike in conventional charging which employs electric contacts. Therefore, it is facilitated to endow the portable equipment with a water-proof structure, and troubles such as the corrosion of the charging connection portion can be avoided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, the foregoing embodiment of the present invention has been described on the case of performing the charging in the state in which the charging arch provided on the side of the portable equipment is suspensibly attached to the hook-shaped induction core stretching from the charger body. However, charging may well be performed in such a way that a charger body is installed (or buried) with an induction core stretching perpendicularly from the ground (such as a floor), and that an insertion portion containing a secondary side coil is set so as to pass the induction core therethrough, whereupon both the members (the induction core and the insertion portion) are held set for a predetermined time period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Besides, the foregoing embodiment of the present invention has been described on the case of mounting the charger body outside the wall, but it is obvious that the charger body may well be mounted inside the wall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In addition, the foregoing embodiment of the present invention has been described as including the primary side coil, the power feed portion and the induction core as the constituent elements of the charging device, but it is obvious that any other constituent element may well be included in the charging device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Yet in addition, the foregoing embodiment of the present invention has been described on the case of mounting the charging device on the wall in a building, the charging device may be mounted, not only in the building, but also in an automobile by way of example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In this manner, according to the present invention, a charging system capable of coping with various sorts of portable equipment and attaining a stable charging efficiency can be provided. </paragraph>
