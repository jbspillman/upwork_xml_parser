<heading lvl="1">FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a clamp connection and release device. More particularly, the invention is for a clamp connection and release device for inline connections for cables, plugs and sockets, electrical connections, as well as hydraulic and pneumatic connections. These connections are generally referred to as couplings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> There are many instances where it is necessary to connect couplings, for subsequent easy release, in order to form an electric or other connection between, for example, a switch or power source and a device which it activates. In one application, when a trailer is connected to a truck or tractor, it is not only necessary to ensure the physical connection between the truck and trailer, but, additionally, electrical or other components in the trailer, which must be operated by the operator in the truck, need to be secured. Therefore, all lighting, air conditioning, hydraulic and electrical connections must be established between the truck and trailer for proper and safe operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In conventional systems, it is typical for a truck to have a socket or outlet conveniently located, usually at the back thereof, the socket or outlet being provided with connectors of various types. Such connectors may be of an electrical type, such as those required to connect the truck with lighting or air conditioning systems in an attached trailer, or of an hydraulic type, to connect the truck&apos;s systems with that of the trailer&apos;s. An example of such a coupling is the braking system. When the trailer is physically connected to the truck so as to be drawn thereby, a plug or corresponding device from the trailer is releasably inserted into the plug or outlet located on the truck, so as to establish the necessary electrical, hydraulic or other (such as pneumatic) connections, as appropriate. Thus, the main physical connection of the truck to the trailer is conventionally established by what is typically described as a multiple pole electrical plug and socket, and, thereafter, the various systems of the truck and trailer are connected for appropriate communication between truck and trailer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> When inserting the plug or other type of connector on the trailer into the socket or outlet of the truck, it is, of course, important that the connection be a very secure one so as to be able to withstand the normal motion, vibrations and sudden movements which may occur under typical, and even severe, driving conditions. For this reason, the plug connection from the trailer to the socket or outlet of the truck is usually a very firm one, often requiring a significant amount of force to disconnect the two. Moreover, the connections may be located at positions which are difficult to access, making maneuverability by the operator difficult for the purposes of separating the plug from the socket. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> According to one aspect of the invention, there is provided a clamp for an inline connector having a male and a female component, the clamp comprising: a first sleeve member having a peripheral portion defining an opening for receiving and holding the male or female component; a second sleeve member adjacent the first sleeve member, the second sleeve member having an opening therein which is adjacent the opening in the first sleeve member; a handle having a first end pivotally connected to the first sleeve member for rotation about the pivotal connection; a bracket member pivotally connected to the second sleeve member at one end thereof and pivotally connected to the handle at another end thereof; wherein rotation of the handle about its pivotal connection to the first sleeve member moves the first sleeve member and the second sleeve member relative to each other between a first position where the first sleeve member and the second sleeve member are closer to each other and a second position where the first sleeve member and the second sleeve member are further apart from each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the first sleeve member is a ring member and defines a circular opening for receiving and holding the male or female component, and the second sleeve member is of a cylindrical shape and defines a circular opening adjacent the circular opening of the ring member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The handle may comprise a pair of parallel end portions each of which connect at one end thereof pivotally to the first sleeve member, a pair of tapering portions extending from the end portions, and a pair of parallel handle portions extending from the tapering portions, the handle portions being connected to each other at ends thereof remote from the tapering portions by a U-shaped member. Preferably, the first sleeve member has a pair of threaded bores therein each of which registers with one of the apertures, and a bolt connects the end portion to the first sleeve member by passing through the aperture of the end portion and threadedly engaging the threaded bore in the first sleeve member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The tapering portions may be downwardly angled with respect to the handle portions, and the end portions are downwardly angled with respect to the tapering portions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the bracket member comprises a pair of parallel first end portions each of which connect at one end thereof pivotally to the second sleeve member, a pair of tapering portions extending from the end portions, and a pair of parallel second end portions extending from the tapering portions. Conveniently, each first end portion of the bracket member has an aperture therein, the second sleeve member has a pair of threaded bores therein each of which registers with one of the apertures, and a bolt connects the first end portion to the second sleeve member by passing through the aperture of the first end portion and threadedly engaging the threaded bore in the second sleeve member. The tapering portions may be downwardly angled with respect to the second end portions, and the first end portions are linear with respect to the tapering portions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a clamp comprising: a housing member defining an opening for receiving and holding a component; an abutment member adjacent the housing member; a handle having a first end pivotally connected to the housing member; a bracket member pivotally connected to the abutment member at one portion thereof and pivotally connected to the handle at another portion thereof; wherein rotation of the handle about its pivotal connection to the housing member moves the housing member and the abutment member relative to each other between a first position and a second position where the housing member and the abutment member are further apart from each other than in the first position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> According to yet a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a method for connecting and disconnecting an inline coupling having a male and female component, the method comprising: locating a first sleeve member, having a peripheral portion defining an opening for receiving and holding the male or female component, adjacent a second sleeve member, the second sleeve member having an opening therein adjacent the opening in the first sleeve member; pivotally connecting a handle having a first end to the first sleeve member for rotation about the pivotal connection; pivotally connecting a bracket member to the second sleeve member at one end thereof and to the handle at another end thereof; and rotating the handle about its pivotal connection to the first sleeve member to move the first sleeve member and the second sleeve member relative to each other between a first position where the first sleeve member and the second sleeve member are closer to each other and a second position where the first sleeve member and the second sleeve member are further apart from each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The clamp connector and release device for facilitates connection and easy release between a pair of registering connectors, such as a plug and a socket, thereby providing an inline connection which can be established and released as needed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The clamp of the invention has particular application when used between a truck and trailer, whereby the various systems and devices on a trailer, such as lighting, air conditioning, braking and other systems, may be connected to the truck so that they can be operated from the truck. The clamp of the invention may establish inline connections of electrical, hydraulic or pneumatic type, and is designed so as to facilitate the connection, and, most importantly, allow ease or efficiency with respect to the release, since the plug and socket connection may often be tight fitting and require a significant amount of force to separate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> While the invention has as an important application in the connection of systems between a truck and trailer, the invention is not to be construed as being limited in this regard. The clamp of the invention may be useful and applicable in any situation where a plug may be connected to a socket, since the clamp of the invention significantly facilitates ease of separation so that the plug can be released or withdrawn from the socket. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In one aspect, the invention comprises a sleeve and associated ring which can be moved towards or away from each other, by the appropriate turning or movement of a handle, so that when the ring and sleeve portion are separated, the plug or connector will be removed from the socket. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Reference is now made to the drawings accompanying this application, which show various views of the clamp connector and release device of the invention, in different views, as well as the elements and components which make up the clamp. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> With particular reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> of the drawings, a perspective view of a clamp <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the invention is shown in each of these Figures, with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> showing the clamp <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in a closed position, when a plug and socket are connected, and with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> showing the clamp <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in an open position, when a plug and socket are disconnected, the clamp <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having been maneuvered so as to disconnect the plug from the socket. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The clamp <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a sleeve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a ring <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, a handle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and a bracket <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, all arranged and connected with respect to each other as will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The clamp <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises the sleeve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which is of substantially cylindrical shape, the sleeve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having an outer surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, an inner surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, a leading end <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and an inner end <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The sleeve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has two substantially diametrically opposed holes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (see also FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>), each of the holes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> having a threaded inner bore for receiving a bolt, as will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The clamp <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> further comprises the ring <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, the ring <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> having an outer surface <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, an inner surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, an inner end <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and a trailing end <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The ring <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is about circular in shape, and is configured so as to be coaxial with the sleeve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In the closed position of the clamp <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> of the drawings, the outer surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the sleeve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and the outer surface <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the ring <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, form a substantially continuous surface, and are of approximately the same diameter. Likewise, the inner surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the sleeve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and the inner surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the ring <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, are of substantially the same diameter, and define a flush, continuous surface when in the closed position, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> of the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The ring <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> has a pair of substantially diametrically opposed holes <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, each of which has an internal bore for receiving a bolt (see again FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>), as will be described more fully below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In the embodiments shown in the drawings, the inner end <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the sleeve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, as well as the inner end <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and trailing end <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the ring <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, are approximately normal to the axis of both the sleeve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and ring <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> respectively. However, in the embodiment shown, the leading edge <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the sleeve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is cut obliquely with respect to the axis of the sleeve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and is, in use, designed to engage or abut a correspondingly shaped surface surrounding a plug or socket. It will, however, be appreciated that while an oblique leading end <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the sleeve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> of the drawings, the particular angle, and even shape, of the leading edge <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> will be determined and configured so as to properly engage the surface surrounding a plug or socket with which the clamp <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is used. While it may be preferable, in certain circumstances, to shape the leading end <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the sleeve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> according to the surface which it engages, such a shaping is not required by the invention, and any shaped leading end <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which will engage the surface surrounding the plug or socket in a manner to allow the proper functioning of the clamp <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will suffice. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> At the top <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the sleeve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, there is provided a cut-out portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> which is of rectangular shape. The ring <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> has, also at its top <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> a groove or recess <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> which is provided in a portion of the ring <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The recess <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is cut from them inner surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the ring <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, through only a portion of the thickness of the ring <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, such that the outer surface <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the ring <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> at the top <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> thereof is not affected by the recess <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In the assembled form, to be discussed more fully below, the cut-out portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> registers with the recess <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> so as to provide a continuous channel <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> of the drawings (but also illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>), when the sleeve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and ring <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are adjacent each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> It will be noted that the leading edge <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the sleeve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is layered in its upper half. Thus, the leading end <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> comprises an oblique surface <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> which forms a continuation of the leading edge <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in the lower half, and a perpendicular surface <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, which is substantially parallel to the inner surface <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the sleeve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. This may facilitate a connection which could operate with both an angled and a perpendicular shaped connector. However, the leading end <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be any shape, as necessary, and may also typically be squared off in its entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The clamp <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> further comprises a handle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> designed to connect to the ring <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The handle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, best illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference> of the drawings, comprises a pair of parallel end portions <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, a pair of tapering mid-portions <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, and a pair of parallel handle portions <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. The ends of the handle portions <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> remote from the parallel end portions <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> are connected to each other by a U-shaped portion <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> so that the handle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> constitutes a single unit. The parallel end portions <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> have apertures <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, the purpose of which will be described below, while the handle portions <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> include apertures <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, also to be described more fully below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> It will be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> of the drawings that the handle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is not straight or linear in construction. The tapering mid-portions <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> are configured at angle &agr; with respect to the handle portions <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, so as to depend downwardly from these handle portions <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, while the parallel end portions <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> are at angle &bgr; with respect to the tapering mid-portions <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. The construction of the handle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> so as to have the handle portions, tapering mid-portions and parallel end portions, configured at these angles facilitates operation of the release function of the clamp <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, to be described more fully below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In use, the handle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is connected to the ring <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The distance defined between the parallel end portions <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is slightly greater than the outer diameter of the ring <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The apertures <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> in the parallel end portions <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> are located so that they register and correspond with the holes <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> in the ring <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. A bolt <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> (seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4, 11</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) extends through each of unthreaded apertures <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> in the parallel end portions <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, and engages with the internally threaded holes <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> located in the ring. The connection established is such that the handle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is able to pivot or rotate about the bolt <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> so that rotational movement of the handle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> relative to the ring <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The clamp <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the invention further comprises a bracket <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, best illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference> of the drawings. The bracket <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> comprises parallel end portions <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, each of which contains an aperture <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> respectively. The bracket <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> comprises a pair of tapering mid-portions <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, and a pair of end portions <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, each of the end portions having an aperture <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> respectively. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> of the drawings, it will be noted that the tapering mid-portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is at an angle e with respect to the end portion <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. In side view, the tapering mid-portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and parallel end portion <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are linear, or form a continuous line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The distance between the parallel end portions <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is sufficient so as to straddle both the ring <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and sleeve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, as well as the parallel end portions <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of the handle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. This can best be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> of the drawings. The bracket <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> is connected to the sleeve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by passing a bolt <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6, 11</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) through each of apertures <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, the apertures <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> being aligned with or registering with the holes <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> respectively in the sleeve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A bolt <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> passes through each of the apertures <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and is secured within the threaded bore of the holes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> so as to firmly secure the bracket <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> to the sleeve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the clamp <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. It should be noted that the bolts <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> securing the bracket <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> to the sleeve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are constructed such that the bracket <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> is capable of relative movement with respect to the sleeve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, so that it can rotate or pivot about the bolt <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The bracket <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> is also connected to the handle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. In this regard, it will be noted that the apertures <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> in the handle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> register with the apertures <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> respectively in the bracket <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, and the handle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and bracket <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> are thereby connected by passing a bolt <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> (seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</cross-reference>) through apertures <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> respectively, and another bolt <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> through apertures <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> respectively. The bolts <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> secure the bracket <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and handle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> together such that both the bracket <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and handle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are capable of pivotal or rotational movement relative to each other about the bolts <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> when in the secured position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The clamp <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the invention is intended to facilitate the connection and disconnection between a plug and socket, or to otherwise axially connect electrical, hydraulic or pneumatic components in line, in a cable. It will be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> of the drawings that a cable <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is, in use, secured to the inner surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the ring <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The cable <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> has at one end <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> thereof a series of electrical pins, in this particular example, which will connect to a plug or socket in line. The plug or socket, represented in phantom lines by reference numeral <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> of the drawings, has a series of female pin receivers <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> intended to receive pins <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> at the end <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> of the cable <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. The plug or socket <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> is connected through appropriate wiring or cable connections to controls, switches, or other device(s) as desired, which may be located in the truck. On the other hand, the cable <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, including the various pins <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, may be located in the trailer being drawn by the truck, and the various electrical pins <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> will branch out to connect to devices in the trailer, such as lighting, air conditioning or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The operation of the clamp <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the invention, to be described, facilitates the connection and disconnection between the cable <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, and the plug <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Reference is now made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</cross-reference> of the drawings. It will be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> that the sleeve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and ring <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are adjacent each other. In this position, the entire clamp <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is moved forward so that the plug <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> enters the sleeve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and an axial connection is formed between the end <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> of the cable and the plug <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. In this way, an electrical coupling is established between the pins <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and the pin receiver apertures <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. A secure connection is made between the cable <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and the plug <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> so that even severe truck motions and vibrations will not result in the inadvertent disconnection which could result in a dangerous situation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The clamp <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the invention functions in its most useful form when it is desired to disconnect the end <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> of the cable <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> from the plug <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. Since the axial connection is usually a very firm one, in order to withstand the movement and vibration of machines and vehicles, it is often difficult to pull out the cable <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> from the plug <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. Moreover, the access of an operator may be limited, making it even more difficult to maneuver the cable <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> from the plug <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In the clamp <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the invention, simple removal of the cable <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> can be achieved as follows. Reference is made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> of the drawings, which shows the handle in the raised position. As the handle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is raised, or rotated in the direction indicated by arrow A, from the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> to the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, the handle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and bracket <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> pivot relative to each other about the bolt <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. Further, the handle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, as it moves, pivots about the bolt <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> on the ring <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and the bracket <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> pivots about bolt <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> on the sleeve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Due to the shape and configuration of the handle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and bracket <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, as well as their connection with respect to each other, movement of the handle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> from the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> to the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> results in the ring <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> moving away from the sleeve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, to create a gap <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> therebetween. The movement of the ring <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> away from the sleeve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> causes the cable <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> to be pulled back and away from the plug <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, effecting the disconnection. Thus, a simple movement of the handle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, and the configuration of the clamp <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, provides a mechanical advantage to the user whereby the ring <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is pulled back from the sleeve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, requiring much less force, and easy maneuverability, in separating the cable <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> from the plug <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that the reverse operation may also apply, enabling the cable <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> to be connected to the plug <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> by operating the handle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> so as to close the gap <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> between the ring <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and the sleeve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In an embodiment of the invention, this connection operation may be facilitated by a simple hooking or engagement of the sleeve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the surrounding portions of the plug <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment shown, the leading edge <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the sleeve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is oblique or angled, and would typically engage a correspondingly angled housing or portion surrounding the plug <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> to enhance proper connection. As mentioned above, this leading edge <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be constructed so as to have any number of oblique angles, as the situation requires, or may simply be flat. In another alternative, this leading edge <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may have a specific form and shape which matches that of the housing surrounding the plug <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> to which it will be connected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The cut-out portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in the sleeve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and the recess <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> in the ring <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, preferably register with each other to form the channel <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> as shown, and would typically be used to ensure that the cable <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is properly centered and/or located within the clamp <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> so that when the clamp <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is used to connect the cable to a plug or socket, the pins <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and recesses <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> therefor will correctly match. Thus, the cable <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may include a projection, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> in phantom lines and identified by reference numeral <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> also shows the cut-out portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and recess <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> in the sleeve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and ring <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> While the clamp <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the invention has as an important application thereof the important function of connecting systems between a truck and trailer, the clamp of the invention is certainly not limited to such use. Any inline or axial connection between a plug and socket could benefit from the use of the clamp of the invention. Further, the clamp of the invention could be used for hydraulic, pneumatic or other types of connections and disconnections, and its function is not to be construed as being limited to electrical connections. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Additionally, where the cable, plug and/or socket have other than a circular shape, the sleeve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and ring <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may be appropriately shaped so as to conform to the particular cable and connection arrangement for which it will be used. For example, if the clamp is used in an ordinary household outlet, the sleeve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and/or ring <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may be rectangularly shaped so as to receive a standard residential plug. The clamp can also be used to connect axial cables such as TV or other forms of inline cable, where it is often difficult and cumbersome to separate conventional connections. The clamp of the invention allows increased force to be applied in separating a plug from a socket, but since the force will be appropriately applied by the separation of the sleeve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and ring <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> so that the components will not be damaged or broken, the additional force will not be harmful. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The invention is not limited to the precise construction or details described hereabove, and variations within the scope of the claims may be made. </paragraph>
