<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an enhanced optical transceiver arrangement, and in particular, to an enhanced optical transceiver arrangement that can be optically coupled with an optical fiber ribbon for receiving and transmitting optical signals thereto and therefrom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Background Information </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Computer and communication systems are now being developed in which optical devices, such as optical fibers, are used as a conduit (also known as a wave guide) for modulated light waves to transmit information. These systems typically include a light emitter or a light detector optically connected to the optical fibers. A typical light emitter may be a so-called edge emitter, or a surface emitter, such as a vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL). A typical light detector may be a photodiode. A generic term of either a light emitter or a light detector is an &ldquo;optoelectronic transducer.&rdquo; A generic term for a light emitter and a light detector arrangement is an optical transceiver. The optical fibers, which collectively form a fiber-optic cable or ribbon, are typically coupled to the respective light detector and the light emitter, so that optical signals can be transmitted back and forth, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> As an example, optoelectronic transducers convert electrical signals to or from optical signals; the optical signals carry data to a receiver (light detector) from a transmitter (light emitter) at very high speeds. Typically, the optical signals are converted into, or converted from, the associated electrical signals using known circuitry. Such optoelectronic transducers are often used in devices, such as computers, in which data must be transmitted at high rates of speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The conventional light emitter allows for integrated two-dimensional array configurations. For example, the active regions of a conventional VCSEL can be arranged in a linear array, for instance 12 active regions spaced about 250 microns apart, or in area arrays, for example, 16&times;16 arrays or 8&times;8 arrays. Of course, other arrangements of the arrays are also possible. Nevertheless, linear arrays are typically considered to be preferable for use with optoelectronic transducers, since it is generally considered easier to align the optical fibers that collect the light emitted from the VCSELs in a linear array, than in an area array. Moreover, it is also possible to utilize the active regions singly, i.e., without being arranged in an array. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The optoelectronic transducers are normally located on either input/output cards or port cards that are connected to an input/output card. Moreover, in a computer system, for example, the input/output card (with the optoelectronic transducer attached thereto) is typically connected to a circuit board, for example a mother board. The assembly may then be positioned within a chassis, which is a frame fixed within a computer housing. The chassis serves to hold the assembly within the computer housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Typically, each optical fiber of the ribbon is associated with a respective active region. Further, it is conventional for the ends of the optical fibers of the ribbon to terminate in a fiber connector. Such fiber connectors usually have an industry standard configuration, such as the MTP&reg; fiber connectors manufactured by US Conec, Ltd. of Hickory, N.C. However, fiber connectors having the industry standard configuration are not suitable for connecting directly with the sensitive active regions of the typical light emitters or light detectors. Should direct contact occur between the respective active regions and the fiber connector, the fiber connector would likely damage the active regions, causing the light emitter or light detector to become inoperative. It is thus conventional to space the fiber connector away from the active regions. However, as will be appreciated, by providing a space, it thus becomes desirable to provide a way of optically coupling the active regions with the fiber connector, so that the optical signals can be accurately and efficiently transmitted therebetween. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> One conventional manner of optically coupling the active regions with the fiber connector is to provide a lens assembly in the space therebetween. However, lens assemblies tend to be complicated and expensive. Thus, it is also known to provide a fiber optic coupler between the active regions and the fiber connector. However, the conventional fiber optic coupler has a limited length, due to manufacturing constraints. Thus, the known fiber connectors must be positioned relatively close to the active regions, which may limit design options. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the typical optical transceiver arrangement utilizes separate modules for both the light emitter and light detector, thus requiring a substantial amount of board space. Further, such separate modules are often difficult to assemble in the tight confines provided. Thus, it is desirable to provide an optical transceiver arrangement that does not occupy much space. Moreover, it is further desirable to provide an optical transceiver arrangement that is relatively easy to assemble and place in its desired location. Additionally, it is desirable to provide an optical transceiver arrangement in which the light emitter and the light detector are provided in the same package. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> It is, therefore, a principal object of this invention to provide an enhanced optical transceiver arrangement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the invention to provide an enhanced optical transceiver arrangement that solves the above mentioned problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> These and other objects of the present invention are accomplished by the enhanced optical transceiver arrangement disclosed herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> According to one aspect of the invention, the optical transceiver arrangement is formed from a plurality of interconnected subassemblies. One of the subassemblies is a retainer assembly, which includes a retainer and a carrier assembly. The carrier assembly includes a die carrier, having opposing lands. The opposing lands have a receiving space therebetween, in which either a light emitter die chip or light detector die chip (hereinafter referred to collectively as a die chip) is disposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The carrier is preferably manufactured from a conductive material, so that it can serve as a ground for the die chip. For example, the carrier can be formed from copper, and be gold plated to enhance its conductivity and reduce its susceptibility to oxidation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The carrier further has spaced apart feet, which can be attached to a further subassembly of the optical transceiver arrangement, as will be subsequently described. The feet provide a space under the carrier in which other components can be disposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Each land is adapted to allow an optical coupler to be attached thereto. The optical coupler is adapted to optically couple active regions of the light emitter or light detector with a fiber connector (i.e., an industry standard connector attached to an end of an optical fiber ribbon), so that optical signals can be accurately transmitted therebetween. For example, each land can be provided with a receiving hole, which receives a corresponding alignment pin of the optical coupler in a clearance type fit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The optical coupler includes at least two plates disposed in a superposed relationship. At least one of the plates, or alternatively both of the plates, has a plurality of spaced apart narrow grooves formed in a surface thereof, each of which extends from one end face to another end face of the plates. Each of the narrow grooves has an optical fiber disposed therein, i.e., a fiber that is separate and distinct from the optical fibers of the ribbon. Further, the plate or plates may have a plurality of wide grooves formed in the surface. Each wide groove extends from a respective end face toward an intermediate portion of the plate or plates, for example. Each of the wide grooves has an alignment pin disposed therein. When the plates are joined together in the superposed relationship, the narrow grooves form through holes for the respective optical fibers, and the wide grooves form wide holes for the alignment pins. When formed, each of the optical fibers of the optical coupler are alignable with respective ones of the active regions of the die chip, respective ones of the alignment pins are insertable into the receiving holes in the lands of the carrier, and respective other ones of the alignment pins are engagable with the fiber connector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The optical fibers of the optical coupler may be actively aligned with the active regions, so as to ensure that the emitted light does not partially or completely &ldquo;miss&rdquo; its intended target. Thereafter, a UV curable adhesive, for example, could be used to fix the respective alignment pins in the respective receiving holes in the lands, thereby locking the optical coupler in alignment with the active regions of the die chip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> After alignment, an epoxy, for example, can be used to seal the exterior edges of the optical coupler to the surface of the die chip. The epoxy may have a sufficiently high viscosity so as to prevent the epoxy from flowing into the gap between the edge of the optical coupler and the active regions of the die chip. Thus, a sealed air gap will be formed between the ends of the optical fibers in the coupler and the active regions to allow for the transmission of light, while preventing contaminants from entering this space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The carrier assembly further includes a flex cable that is electrically coupled to the die chip. The flex cable has both ground wires (or a ground layer) and signal wires which may be covered by an insulating coating, such as plastic. The insulating coating may be removed in a region at one end of the flex cable, to form one or more &ldquo;windows&rdquo; which expose the signal wires, grounds wires or both as they pass through the space of the windows. For example, if the flex cable is provided with two windows, one disposed over the other, the lower window can be adapted to expose the ground wires, to allow the ground wires to be electrically coupled to the conductive carrier. The upper window can then be adapted to expose the signal wires, which can then be electrically coupled to the die chip. This arrangement works well when the die chip is attached and directly grounded to the carrier. Alternatively, if the die chip is not directly grounded to the carrier, then the flex cable can be provided with only one window, which is adapted to expose both the ground wires and the signal wires. These can then be electrically coupled to the die chip, for example a light detector die chip, to provide both a signal path and a return ground path. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Another end of the flex cable may also be provided with a conductive plate, such as a metal stiffener, electrically bonded to the ground wires/ground layer of the flex cable. This conductive plate can then be attached to a ground potential, in a manner that will be subsequently described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In use, the flex cable may be arranged to extend down the front of the carrier (i.e., on the side the die chip is disposed), and then flexed and bent to pass between the feet of the carrier and through the space therebetween. Thus, the conductive plate will then be disposed in a region behind the carrier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The retainer assembly further includes the retainer, into which the carrier assembly is disposed. The retainer has a housing formed from an insulating material, such as a polymer, for example. The housing has a through hole extending therethrough. The carrier assembly is placed into a rear end of the through hole and arranged so that the coupler is disposed almost entirely within the through hole, with the carrier being disposed outside of the through hole. Once in position, the carrier assembly can be fixed to the housing, for example, by adhering the coupler to the walls defining the through hole. The adhering can be accomplished using a UV structural epoxy, or a thermal initiated epoxy, for example, which would provide the resulting structure with a desired rigidity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The retainer may also be provided with latching fingers disposed at a front end of the through hole. The latching fingers are adapted to engage with an industry-standard fiber optic connector, which is plugable into the retainer via the front end of the through hole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The housing and fingers are preferably molded to have a one-piece configuration. This reduces assembly time by eliminating the need to fix separate latching fingers to the housing, and reduces inventory by eliminating multiple parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In a further exemplary aspect of the invention, the front end of the retainer may also be provided with an electromagnetic interference shield. The electromagnetic interference shield is preferably formed from a conductive, non-corrosive material, such as steel having a tin plating. However, the electromagnetic interference shield can be formed of any material that will attenuate electromagnetic interference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The electromagnetic interference shield is hollow, to allow the shield to be slipped over the front end of the retainer. When properly positioned, the edge of the electromagnetic interference shield will be positioned essentially flush with the front end of the retainer. The shield may be provided with inwardly projecting fingers that engage with the surface of the retainer, to hold the shield in place. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The electromagnetic interference shield may be provided with a number of conductive grounding springs, which are disposed around the outer periphery of an end of the shield. The grounding springs may engage with a tailstock, for example, to conductively couple the electromagnetic interference shield to a ground potential. When properly positioned, the grounding springs hold the electromagnetic interference shield in a fixed position relative to the tailstock. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The shield can be used to hold the first and second housings together, when two housings are provided. That is, the shield can be slid around the adjacent housings, and serve as a clamp to retain the housings in their relative positions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The optical transceiver arrangement may further include a laminate assembly. The laminate assembly includes a printed circuit board or wiring board, that has a plurality of superposed, alternating conductive layers and insulating layers formed in discrete planes. A front surface of the wiring board may have various electronic components, such as a light emitter driver chip and/or light detector driver chip, attached thereto, and may have electrically conductive pathways or wirings (also known as traces) between the components. The driver chips may be positioned so that in the final optical transceiver arrangement, the driver chips are positioned away from the carrier to aid in heat dissipation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The printed circuit board can be adapted to allow it to be attached to a further printed circuit board, for example, by an end user. By way of example, the lower surface of the printed circuit board can be provided with a plurality of conductive pads arranged in an array, each of which is coupled to a ground plane, power plane and wiring plane of the board, using vias, for example, and each of which may be attached to a respective lead of a further printed circuit board using ball grid array (BGA) technology. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The laminate assembly may further include a polymer coating disposed on the upper surface of the printed circuit board, and upon which the retainer assembly can be disposed. The polymer coating may be relatively thick, and formed to provide locating features to facilitate the positioning of the various other subassemblies. For example, the housing of the retainer assembly may be provided with one or more projecting pins on a lower surface thereof, and the polymer coating may be provided with receiving holes that accommodate the respective projecting pins. Thus, during manufacturing, the retainer assembly can be quickly located on the laminate assembly in the desired location. Moreover, the coating protects the wirings and components on the surface of the circuit board, and helps to distribute heat generated by the drivers over a larger surface area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the polymer coating may be provided with one or more recesses formed therein, to expose respective conductive pads that are electrically coupled to the ground plane. The feet of the carrier can then be electrically bonded, using an electrical epoxy for example, to the conductive pads so that the carrier is electrically coupled to the ground plane. Moreover, the conductive plate of the flex cable may be electrically bonded to another conductive pad, to provide another means of electrically coupling the ground plane to the die chip and carrier. Further, the signal wires of the flex cable may be coupled, for example wire bonded, to respective signal traces on the surface of the laminate. Thereafter, the various electrical connections can be coated to protect the connections and wires from being damaged. For example, the coating can be a so-called chip coat epoxy material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> During the coupling of the flex cable to the laminate assembly, the retainer assembly housing may also be fixed to the laminate assembly. For example, the housing or housings may be epoxied to the laminate assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In another exemplary aspect of the invention, the optical transceiver arrangement may include a cover member including a heat sink disposed over the laminate assembly. In this exemplary aspect of the invention, the polymer coating may include a step arranged around an outer periphery thereof, and the heat sink cover may have a flange that engages with the step to position the heat sink cover relative to the laminate assembly. Once in position, the heat sink cover can transfer and dissipate heat generated by the drivers, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The heat sink cover may also be provided with a downwardly-projecting finger that is adapted to engage with an exposed conductive pad of the printed circuit board, which is coupled with the ground plane. In this manner, when the heat sink cover is in position, the heat sink cover will be electrically coupled with a ground potential, allowing the heat sink cover to serve as a further ground potential for the light emitter/light detector. Moreover, the downwardly-projecting finger can be positioned to extend between the adjacent housings, and in particular between the respective light emitter and light detector when so provided, to serve as an electromagnetic emissions separator. Thus, the heat sink cover can help prevent electromagnetic interference from occurring between the light emitter and light detector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> When properly positioned, the heat sink cover may be bonded in place, for example using an epoxy, and may be positioned to abut against a back of the retainer assembly. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The invention will now be described in more detail by way of example with reference to the embodiments shown in the accompanying figures. It should be kept in mind that the following described embodiments are only presented by way of example and should not be construed as limiting the inventive concept to any particular physical configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Further, in the application, the terms &ldquo;upper&rdquo;, &ldquo;lower&rdquo;, &ldquo;front&rdquo;, &ldquo;back&rdquo;, &ldquo;over&rdquo;, &ldquo;under&rdquo;, and similar such terms are not to be construed as limiting the invention to a particular orientation. Instead, these terms are used only on a relative basis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the present invention is directed toward an optical transceiver arrangement <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In an exemplary aspect of the invention, the optical transceiver arrangement <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is formed from a plurality of interconnected subassemblies, the details of which will be described in the paragraphs that follow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, one of the subassemblies of the optical transceiver arrangement <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is a retainer assembly <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which includes a retainer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and a carrier assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. As best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, the carrier assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> includes a die carrier <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, having opposing lands <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In the exemplary illustrated embodiment, the opposing lands <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> have a receiving space therebetween, in which either a light emitter die chip or a light detector die chip (hereinafter referred to collectively as a die chip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>) is disposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The carrier <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be manufactured from a conductive material, so that it can serve as a ground for the die chip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. For example, the carrier <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can be formed from copper, and be gold plated to enhance its conductivity and reduce its susceptibility to oxidation. However, it is contemplated that the carrier <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can be manufactured from other materials without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In another exemplary aspect of the invention, the carrier <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> has spaced apart feet <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, which can be attached to a further subassembly of the optical transceiver arrangement <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, which will be subsequently described. The feet <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> provide a space under the carrier <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in which other components can be disposed. Moreover, the feet <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are shown as being in registration with the lands <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. However, variations in the relative placement of the feet <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and lands <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are within the scope of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Referring also to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, each land <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is adapted to allow an optical coupler <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to be attached thereto. Further, the lands <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are adapted to project out beyond the die chip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, to prevent the coupler <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> from having direct contact with the active regions (i.e., the regions that emit or detect the light) of the die chip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The optical coupler <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is adapted to optically couple the active regions of the light emitter or light detector with a fiber connector (i.e., an industry standard connector attached to an end of an optical fiber ribbon, not shown), so that optical signals can be accurately transmitted therebetween. For example, each land <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be provided with a receiving or alignment hole <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>), which receives a corresponding alignment pin <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the optical coupler <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in a clearance fit. The alignment pins received within the alignment holes are not shown (due to their receipt within the respective holes) but are similarly tailored to the alignment pins <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> projecting out of the opposite side of the coupler. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Referring also to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>, the optical coupler <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> can be manufactured in accordance with the disclosure contained within U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/______ attorney docket no. ROC920010151US1-IBM-210, filed concurrently herewith, entitled Enhanced Optical Coupler, and assigned to International Business Machines Corporation. Briefly, such an optical coupler <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may include at least two plates <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> disposed in a superposed relationship. At least one of the plates, or alternatively both of the plates, has a plurality of spaced apart narrow grooves <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> formed in a surface thereof, each of which extends from one end face to another end face of the respective plates. Each of the narrow grooves <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> has an optical fiber <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> disposed therein (only the end face of which being shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>). Further, the plate or plates have a plurality of wide grooves <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> formed in the surface. Each wide groove <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> extends from a respective end face, and may terminate at an intermediate portion of the plate or plates. Each of the wide grooves has an alignment pin <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> disposed therein. When the plates are joined together in the superposed relationship, the narrow grooves <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> form through holes for the respective optical fibers, and the wide grooves <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> form blind holes for the alignment pins. Alternatively, the wide grooves can extend from end face to end face of the plates, so that instead of blind holes, wide through holes are formed. When formed, each of the optical fibers <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> of the optical coupler <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are alignable with respective ones of the active regions of the die chip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, respective ones of the alignment pins <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are insertable into the receiving holes <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in the lands <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the carrier <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and respective other ones of the alignment pins <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are engagable with the fiber optic connector (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The optical fibers <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> of the optical coupler <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may be actively aligned with the active regions, so as to ensure that the emitted light does not partially or completely &ldquo;miss&rdquo; its intended target. By way of example, with the alignment pins <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> received with a clearance fit in the respective receiving holes <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, and with a <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> channel light emitter (i.e., a light emitter having <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> active regions), the light emitter may be turned on (activated). The first optical fiber of the optical coupler <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> could then be aligned, in both a x- and a y-direction, with the center of the first channel. The optical coupler <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> could then be rotated about the z-axis of the first channel, until the maximum output of the twelfth channel is ascertained. Thereafter, a UV curable adhesive, for example, could be used to fix the respective alignment pins in the respective receiving holes in the lands, thereby locking the optical coupler in alignment with the active regions of the die chip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> After alignment, an epoxy, for example, can be used to seal the exterior edges of the optical coupler <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to the surface of the die chip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The epoxy may have a sufficiently high viscosity so as to prevent the epoxy from flowing into the gap between the front edge of the optical coupler <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the active regions of the die chip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Thus, a sealed air gap will be formed between the ends of the optical fibers <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> in the coupler <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the active regions to allow for the efficient transmission of light, while preventing contaminants from entering this space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In a further exemplary aspect of the invention, the carrier assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> includes a flex cable <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> that is electrically coupled to the die chip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. In the exemplary illustrated embodiment, the flex cable <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> has a ground layer (hereinafter referred to as ground wires) and signal wires (shown in hidden lines, and referenced as <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) which may be covered by an insulating coating <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>&prime;, such as plastic. The insulating coating <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>&prime; may be removed in a region at one end of the flex cable <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, to form one or more &ldquo;windows&rdquo; <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> which expose the signal wires, grounds wires, or both as they pass through the space of the windows. For example, if the flex cable <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is provided with two windows <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, one disposed over the other (not shown), the lower window can be adapted to expose the ground wires, so that the exposed ground wires may be electrically coupled to the conductive carrier <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The upper window can then be adapted to expose the signal wires, which can then be electrically coupled to the die chip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. This arrangement works well when the die chip is attached and directly grounded to the carrier <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. For example, the back of the light emitter die chip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be bonded to the carrier <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> using an electrically-conductive epoxy, so that the light emitter die chip is grounded directly to the conductive carrier. Alternatively, if the die chip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is not directly grounded to the carrier <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, then the flex cable <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> can be provided with only one window, which is adapted to expose both the ground wires and the signal wires. These can then be electrically coupled to the die chip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, for example a light detector die chip, to provide both a signal path and a return ground path. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> By way of example, the signal wires and the ground wires of the flex cable <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be electrically coupled to the carrier <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and/or die chip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> using a so-called tab bonding technique. Such a technique is well known to those skilled in the art, and includes using pressure, heat and vibrations to ultrasonically weld the components together. Moreover, a wire-bond conductive ball (not shown) may be used to couple the signal wires to the die chip. For example, the wire-bond ball may be connected to tab bonds of the die chip. The wire-bond ball may be coined down (i.e., flattened), to provide a smooth, flat surface to which the signal wires may be bonded. By bonding the signal wires to the wire-bond balls, as opposed to a surface of the die chip, the surface of the die chip is protected against damage that may otherwise occur during the tab bonding technique. The tab bonds may then be covered with a chip-coat protective adhesive, for example, to protect the connection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Another end of the flex cable <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be provided with a conductive plate <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, such as a metal stiffener plate, electrically bonded to the ground wires/ground plane of the flex cable. This conductive plate <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> can then be easily attached to a ground potential, in a manner that will be subsequently described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> In use, the flex cable <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be arranged to extend down the front of the carrier <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> (i.e., on the side the die chip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is disposed), and then flexed and bent to pass between the feet <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the carrier and through the space therebetween. Thus, when in use, the conductive plate <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> will be disposed in a region behind the carrier <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> As best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 3</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the retainer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is adapted to receive the carrier assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated exemplary aspect of the invention, the retainer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> includes first and second connector housings <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> disposed side-by-side, each of which is adapted to accommodate a respective carrier assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> at one end thereof This configuration allows both a light emitter and a light detector, for example, to be disposed in the same assembly, therefore saving circuit board space. The respective housings <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> can be manufactured separately and joined together, for example, or the two housings can be integrally molded together. In the illustrated exemplary embodiment, the retainer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> includes a pair of housings <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> formed, for example, from an insulating material, such as a polymer. Each of the housings <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> has a through hole <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> extending therethrough. A respective carrier assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is placed at a rear end of each of the through holes <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and arranged so that the coupler <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is disposed almost entirely within the through hole, with the carrier <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> being disposed outside of the through hole. Once in position, the carrier assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be fixed to the retainer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, for example, by adhering the coupler <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to the walls defining the through holes. The adhering can be accomplished using a UV structural epoxy, for example, or a thermal initiated epoxy, for example, which would provide the resulting structure with a desired rigidity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The retainer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may also be provided with a pair of latching fingers <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> disposed at a front end of each of the through holes <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The latching fingers <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are adapted to engage with an industry-standard fiber optic connector (not shown), such as a MPO/MTP connector which is plugable into the retainer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> via the front end of the through hole <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Moreover, and as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, when not attached to the fiber optic connector, plugs <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> can be inserted in the respective through holes <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and retained therein by the fingers <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. These plugs <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> prevent contaminants from entering the through holes, when the optical transceiver arrangement <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is not in use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The housing <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and fingers <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are preferably molded to have a one-piece configuration. This reduces assembly time by eliminating the need to fix separate latching fingers to the housing, and reduces inventory by eliminating multiple parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Referring also to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</cross-reference>, the front end of the retainer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may also be provided with an electromagnetic interference shield <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The electromagnetic interference shield <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is preferably formed from a conductive, non-corrosive material, such as steel having a tin plating. However, the electromagnetic interference shield <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> can be formed of any material that will attenuate electromagnetic interference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> As shown, the electromagnetic interference shield <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is hollow, to allow the shield to be slipped over the front end of the retainer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. When properly positioned, the edge of the electromagnetic interference shield <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> will be positioned essentially flush with the front end of the retainer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The shield <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> may be provided with inwardly projecting fingers <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> that engage with the surface of the retainer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, to hold the shield in place. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the electromagnetic interference shield <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is provided with a number of conductive grounding springs <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, which are disposed around the outer periphery of an end of the shield. The grounding springs <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> engage, for example, with a tailstock <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> attached to a system frame <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>&prime; of a computer, for example, to conductively couple the electromagnetic interference shield to a ground potential. When properly positioned, the grounding springs <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> hold the electromagnetic interference shield <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> in a fixed position relative to the tailstock <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> By way of example, the grounding springs <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> can be formed as metal fingers which extend in the same plane, and contiguous with, a respective wall of the shield <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The metal fingers can then be bent so that the fingers are disposed essentially superposed to the respective walls they are attached to. However, due to the memory effect of the material, the fingers will exert a spring force that acts in a direction away from the walls. Thus, the metal fingers can engage with the tailstock, in the aforementioned manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated exemplary embodiment, the shield <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> can be used to hold the first and second housings <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> together, when two separate housings are provided. That is, the shield <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> can be slid around the adjacent housings <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, and serve as a clamp to retain the housings in their relative positions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Referring also to FIGS. <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, in a further exemplary aspect of the invention, the optical transceiver arrangement <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> further includes a laminate assembly <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The laminate assembly <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> comprises a printed circuit board or wiring board <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, that includes a plurality of superposed, alternating conductive layers and insulating layers formed in discrete planes. Although the individual layers are not separately shown, such arrangements are known to those skilled in the art. In the exemplary illustrated embodiment, the wiring board <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is a relatively flat board having a front surface that has various electronic components <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, such as a light emitter driver chip and/or light detector driver chip attached thereto, and having electrically conductive pathways or wirings (also known as traces) between the respective components. Preferably, the driver chips are positioned so that in the completed optical transceiver arrangement, the driver chips are positioned away from the carrier <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to aid in heat dissipation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> By way of example, the conductive layers may include one or more internal wiring planes (i.e., a set of wirings located in one plane), each of which includes a number of individual conductive wirings. As mentioned above, the wirings are used to interconnect the various electronic components locatable on the printed circuit board together, and allow for the transmission of electrical signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Further, the conductive layers of the board may also include one or more power planes and/or ground planes, which are typically sheets of conductive material, such as copper. The power plane is used to supply power from the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> to the various electronic components <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> located on the printed circuit board, whereas the ground plane serves as a ground potential for the various electronic components. The power plane and the ground plane may be located in different planes from the wiring plane, or may be located in the same plane as a respective wiring plane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Each of the conductive layers of the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> may be separated from the other overlying and/or underlying conductive layers by a respective layer of insulating material. Moreover, the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> may be provided with a number of plated mechanically-formed through holes and/or a number of plated mechanically-formed vias (i.e., blind holes formed in the insulating layers and plated or filled with a conductive material). Each plated via and plated through hole is electrically coupled to a respective conductive layer, and is used to transmit power or electrical signals, through respective insulating layers, to and from the associated electronic components and/or between the respective conductive layers. Further, the vias, for example, can be used to interconnect the ground plane and wiring plane to respective conductive pads <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> formed on surfaces of the wiring board. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The printed circuit board <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> can be adapted to allow its attachment to a further printed circuit board <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>), such as a backplane, for example, by an end user. By way of example, the lower surface of the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> can be provided with a plurality of conductive pads arranged in an array (not shown), each of which is coupled to the ground plane, power plane and/or wiring plane, using the vias, for example, and each of which may be attached to a respective lead of the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> using ball grid array (BGA) technology. Although not shown, such technology is well known to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The laminate assembly <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> may also include a polymer, for example, coating <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> disposed on the upper surface of the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, and upon which the retainer assembly <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be disposed. The polymer coating <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> may be relatively thick and formed to provide locating features <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> to facilitate the positioning of the various other subassemblies. For example, the housings <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> may be provided with one or more projecting pins <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> on lower surfaces thereof (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>), and the polymer coating <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> may be provided with receiving holes <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>&prime; that accommodate the respective projecting pins. Thus, the retainer assembly <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be quickly located on the laminate assembly <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> in a desired position. Moreover, the coating <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> protects the wirings and components on the surface of the circuit board <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, and helps to distribute heat generated by the drivers <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> over a larger surface area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the polymer coating <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> may be provided with one or more recesses formed therein. In the illustrated exemplary embodiment, a relatively large recess may be formed in a central region of the coating <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, to expose signal and/or power traces <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>&Prime; that are coupled to the wiring plane and/or power plane, and to expose one or more conductive pads <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> that are electrically coupled to the ground plane. The feet <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the carrier <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can then be electrically bonded, using an electrical epoxy for example, to the exposed conductive pads <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> electrically coupled to the ground plane, so that the carrier is likewise electrically coupled to the ground plane. Moreover, the conductive plate <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the flex cable <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be electrically bonded to another conductive pad <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, to provide another means of electrically coupling the ground plane to die chip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and carrier <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Further, the signal wires of the flex cable <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be coupled, for example wire bonded, to the respective signal and/or power traces <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>&Prime; on the surface of the wiring board <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, the various electrical connections can be coated to protect the connections and wires from being damaged. For example, the coating can be a so-called chip coat epoxy material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> During the coupling of the flex cable <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to the wiring board <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, the housings <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> may also be fixed to the laminate assembly <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. For example, the housing or housings may be epoxied to the laminate assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The optical transceiver arrangement <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may also include a cover member <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> that serves as a heat sink is disposed over the laminate assembly <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. In this exemplary aspect of the invention, the polymer coating <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> includes a step arranged around an outer periphery thereof, and the heat sink cover <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> has a flange that engages with the step to position the heat sink cover relative to the laminate assembly. Once in position, the heat sink cover <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> can transfer and dissipate heat generated by the drivers <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The heat sink cover <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> may also be formed from an electrically conductive material and be provided with a downwardly-projecting finger <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> that is adapted to engage with an exposed conductive pad <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the printed circuit board, which is coupled with the ground plane. In this manner, when the heat sink cover <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is in position, the heat sink cover will be electrically coupled with a ground potential, allowing the heat sink cover to serve as a further ground potential for the light emitter/light detector. Moreover, the downwardly-projecting finger <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> can be positioned to extend between the first and second housings <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, and in particular between the respective light emitter and light detector when so provided, to serve as an electromagnetic emissions separator. For example, the finger <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> can extend through the gap <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. Thus, the heat sink cover <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> can help to prevent electromagnetic interference from occurring between the light emitter and the light detector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Once properly positioned, and referring back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the heat sink cover <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is bonded in place, for example using an epoxy, and will preferably be positioned to abut against a back of the retainer assembly <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Moreover, in an exemplary aspect of the invention, a gap <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is preferably present between the back of the carrier <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the heat sink cover <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, which is subsequently filled with a thermal epoxy <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>. The thermal epoxy provides for improved conductivity between the carrier and the heat sink cover. This gap <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, which may be 0.005 inches, for example, can be established using ears <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>) which project from a rear of the respective housings <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The ears <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> abut against the heat sink cover <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> when the heat sink, carrier, housings and laminate assembly are all properly joined together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The present invention results in an optical transceiver arrangement in which various delicate components are sealed and protected. Moreover, the thermal characteristics are optimized, resulting in increased efficiency. Further, optical clarity is enhanced and the resulting structure can be easily assembled and used in small spaces. Further, the arrangement allows for both a transmitter and detector in the same package. Additionally, this arrangement allows NPO and MTP optical connectors to be selectively attached thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> It should be understood, however, that the invention is not necessarily limited to the specific arrangement and components shown and described above, but may be susceptible to numerous variations within the scope of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> It will be apparent to one skilled in the art that the manner of making and using the claimed invention has been adequately disclosed in the above-written description of the preferred embodiments taken together with the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> It will be understood that the above description of the preferred embodiments of the present invention are susceptible to various modifications, changes, and adaptations, and the same are intended to be comprehended within the meaning and range of equivalents of the appended claims. </paragraph>
