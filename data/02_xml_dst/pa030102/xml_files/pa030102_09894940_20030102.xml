<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention generally relates to liquid crystal display (LCD) and integrated circuit (IC) fabrication and, more particularly, to a silicon film and fabrication process to laser irradiate silicon film in making polycrystalline silicon thin film transistors (TFTs) for Active Matrix (AM) LCDs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Lateral crystallization by excimer-laser anneal (LC-ELA) is a desirable method for forming high quality polycrystalline silicon films having large and uniform grains. Further, this process permits precise control of the grain boundary locations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>through <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>illustrate steps in an LC-ELA annealing process (prior art). As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, initially amorphous silicon film <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is irradiated by a laser beam that is shaped by an appropriate mask to an array of narrow &ldquo;beamlets&rdquo;. The shape of the beamlets can vary. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, each beamlet is shaped as a straight slit of narrow width, approximately 3-5 microns (&mgr;m). This slit is represented in the figures as the two heavy lines. The width of the slit is the distance between these two lines. This width can vary, but ultimately it is dependent upon the attainable lateral growth length (LGL), which is defined as the distance crystals can grow laterally (inwardly) from the edges of the irradiated area. Typically, the beamlet width is designed to be slightly less than twice the corresponding LGL. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The sequence of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>illustrates the growth of long polysilicon grains by LC-ELA process. A step-and-repeat approach is used. The laser beamlet width (indicated by the 2 parallel, heavy black lines) irradiates the film and, then steps a distance (d), to point <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, smaller than half of the lateral growth length (L), i.e. d&lt;L/2. Using this step-and-repeat process, it is possible to continually grow crystal grains from the point of the initial irradiation, to the point where the irradiation steps cease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is partial cross-sectional view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>illustrating the surface topography of laser-irradiated domains (prior art). After the completion of the lateral growth, the two crystal fronts meet at the center of the domain where they form a &ldquo;boundary&rdquo; between the two crystal regions developing from each opposing edge of the domain. As a result of the grain boundary formation, a &ldquo;ridge&rdquo; <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> develops at the surface of the film at the boundary, corresponding to the planned congruence of the two crystal fronts. Since the substrate steps under the beam a distance of d, where d is less than L/2, the ridge <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is irradiated is a subsequent shot. This ridge <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> remelts and locally planarizes. However, as part of the same process, another ridge is formed at a new location. Therefore, the ridge location will &ldquo;march&rdquo; across the substrate in response to the scans under the beam. </paragraph>

After &ldquo;n&rdquo; shots, the region between adjacent mask slits has been completely crystallized by lateral growth. Consequently, ridges form at positions corresponding (approximately) to the centerlines of the adjacent mask features (i.e. slits). Alternately stated, the film region irradiated by a first slit (the first beamlet in the figure) in the laser mask forms a ridge as a result of the final irradiation shot, at the boundary of where an adjacent slit (the second beamlet in the figure) performed its initial irradiation shot. There is a ridge between each area of the film where the different beamlets have performed their final irradiation shot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It would be beneficial to reduce the size of the ridges formed by the above-mentioned process. It will be even more advantageous to completely eliminate the height variation along the laterally crystallized domain. Such an improvement would relax the positional constraint for the TFT channels formed in an LCD substrate. When roughness (ridges) develops at specific positions <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>), the TFT channels need to be arranged to avoid these regions. That is, the TFTs need to be formed in the planar regions between neighboring ridges to avoid performance deterioration. Even more undesirable is the formation of neighboring TFTs with different performance parameters, resulting from the random formation of TFT channels with ridges adjacent TFT channels without ridges. Hence, some sort of alignment is necessary between the crystallized domains and the position of the TFT channels within these domains. This alignment process introduces additional processing steps, hence increases the cost of the process. It would be desirable to eliminate these additional processing steps so that TFT channels can be placed on the processed (laterally crystallized) film without the requirement of calculating ridge alignments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It will also be desirable if the same process that enables such a surface roughness (ridge) reduction could be used to improve the lateral growth length (LGL) during crystallization. Such improvement would enable an increase of the stepping distance between successive shots. That is, the pitch, or step distance d between shots could be increased (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). The stepping distance of the substrate is a crucial determinant of the process throughput and, hence, in the economics of the LC-ELA process for mass production. The stepping distance depends critically upon the lateral growth length (LGL). LGL is affected by the transient temperature profile of the film, which defines the time possible for the lateral propagation of the two facing crystal fronts, before the remaining molten volume becomes cold enough to trigger copious (explosive) nucleation. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The present invention is a method that results in reduction of the surface ridges on laterally crystallized silicon films and/or the enhancement of the lateral growth length. Depending upon the operating conditions, the method can be applied to reduce the surface ridges, increase the lateral growth length, or achieve a compromise between the two. The method utilizes the temporal separation of laser pulses to achieve remelting and planarization of the surface of silicon films or, alternatively, provides additional thermal energy to the molten silicon film to prolong lateral growth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, a method is provided for maintaining a planar surface as crystal grains are laterally grown in the fabrication of crystallized silicon films. The method comprises: forming a film of amorphous silicon with a surface and a plurality of areas; irradiating each adjacent areas of the silicon film with a first sequence of laser pulses; and, in response to the first sequence of laser pulses, controlling the planarization of the silicon film surface between adjacent areas of the silicon film as the crystal grains are laterally grown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> When irradiating areas of the silicon film with a first sequence of laser pulses, there is a temporal separation between pulses in the range from 30 to 500 nanoseconds (ns). Further, the pulses have a pulse width in the range of 20 to 100 ns, as measured at their full-width-half-maximum (FWHM). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Irradiating areas of the silicon film with a first sequence of laser pulses also includes irradiating with a sequence of pulses having a first pulse with a first intensity and a second pulse with a second intensity. The first and second intensities need not be the same. When lateral growth length is the chief object of the process, the second intensity is typically close to the first intensity and the separation between pulses is smaller. However, when surface planarization is the chief object, the second intensity is typically significantly less than the first intensity and the separation between pulses is greater. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Additional details of the above-described method, and a silicon film formed with a pulsed laser sequence crystallization process are presented in detail below.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a partial cross-sectional view of the present invention silicon film formed from a pulsed laser sequence crystallization process. The silicon film <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> has a plurality of irradiation areas. Areas <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> are shown, but the film <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is not limited to a particular number of areas. These irradiation areas correspond to beamlet widths as the laser shots step across the film <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. Crystal grains <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> are shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> A plurality of temporary ridges <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight> are formed at the center of each irradiation area. A planar silicon film surface <highlight><bold>428</bold></highlight> extends across the silicon film irradiation areas <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>. During processing, the lateral growth length <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> per shot is greater than 2.5 microns. That is, the crystal grain lengths are extended at least 2.5 microns for every laser step. Typically, the silicon film <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> has a thickness <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight> in the range of 100 to 1000 &angst;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates the temporary ridge <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> in greater detail. Temporary ridge <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>, which is representative of the other temporary ridges, has a height <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> in the range of 600 to 1000 Angstroms (&angst;). As discussed in greater detail below, the temporary ridge is formed after the first pulse or sequence of laser pulses, and is reduced in size as a result of subsequent pulses in a sequence of pulses or subsequent irradiation shots. The planar silicon film surface <highlight><bold>428</bold></highlight> extending across the silicon film irradiation areas has a flatness <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> in the range of 50 to 500 &angst;. Alternately stated, the film <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> has permanent ridge, such as permanent ridge <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> with a height in the range of 50 to 500 &angst;. Preferably, the permanent ridge <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> (or surface flatness <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>) is in the range of 50 to 200 &angst;. As explained in more detail below, the temporary ridge <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> is flattened, or reduced in height as a result of a laser pulse (or pulses) subsequent laser pulses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, the present invention utilizes the temporal separation of laser pulses to achieve remelting and planarization of the surface of silicon films. Alternately, the temporal separation provides additional thermal energy to the molten silicon film to prolong lateral growth. Such temporal separation of the laser pulses can be achieved by passing the laser pulse through a pulse extender unit. The function of the pulse extender is to prolong the duration of the pulse that is generated from the excimer laser. This is accomplished by introducing the initial laser beam in a specially designed array of beam splitters and mirrors, which split the beam in several parts and bounce each part several times, within the unit, before recombining all parts at the exit. As a result of the multiple bounces in the unit, the recombined beam features a longer pulse, with a duration that is determined by the optical design of the extender (i.e. the number of splitters). Further exploiting the design of the extender, instead of simply prolonged pulse duration, a temporal beam profile consisting of multiple pulses can be formed, having adjustable and controllable temporal separations and/or intensities. The extent of temporal separation and the control of the intensity of the individual pulses are key parameters for this invention. Some applications of the invention are illustrated in the following examples. </paragraph>

Two pulses are shown in this case, but in principle more pulses could be generated, if so desired. The second pulse (second, in a temporal sense) has a lower intensity than the first, and it is well-separated from the first pulse. That is, the temporal separation between the two pulses is greater than the pulse duration of either pulse, with the pulse duration measured at the Full-Width-Half-Maximum (FWHM) of the pulse. Typical ranges for the various properties of the pulses are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. Typically, the pulse duration of either (both) pulses is in the range of 20-50 ns, however, longer pulses may be desirable for larger intensity pulses, measured at FHWM. The temporal separation between pulses is in the range of 60-250 ns, although wider ranges may be useful. The relative intensity reduction between pulse n and pulse n&plus;1 is in the range of 20 to 90%. In other words, the most recent pulse has a reduced intensity with respect to its predecessor. </paragraph>

Again two pulses are shown, but in principle more pulses could be generated. An important element of this process is to make the second pulse (or other subsequent pulses) of a similar intensity to the first pulse. Further, the temporal separation between the two pulses is less than the pulse duration of either, with the pulse duration measured at the FWHM of the pulse. Typical ranges for the various properties of the pulses are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. The pulse duration (for either pulse) is in the range of 20-100 ns, measured at the FWHM. The temporal separation between pulses is in the range of 30-500 ns. The relative intensity between pulse n and pulse n&plus;1 is approximately the same. In other words, the intensity of the subsequent pulse is similar to its predecessor. </paragraph>

Typical ranges for the various properties of the pulses are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. The pulse duration (for either pulse) is 20-50 ns, measured at the FWHM, the temporal separation between pulses is 30-150 ns, and the relative intensity is reduced in the range of 10%-50% between pulse n and pulse n&plus;1.
