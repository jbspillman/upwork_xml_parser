<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to an apparatus and method for displaying a luminescent icon, and, in one aspect, to an apparatus and method for displaying a luminescent icon on a computer system component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Computer system modules are often interconnected with other components or peripherals to enhance their usefulness. For example, a primary computer system module, often referred to as a CPU, can be interconnected with a printer, an external storage media drive, another computer system module, or the like. Such interconnections are often accomplished by connecting one end of a cable to a connector on one component and connecting the other end of the cable to a connector on another component. The cable and connectors typically comprise multiple conductors, i.e., they provide interconnections for more than one signal line. Generally the signal lines are for transmitting electrical signals, optical signals, or the like. For example, one type of small computer system interface (SCSI) uses at least 25-conductor connectors and cabling to interconnect components. Interconnections can also be accomplished by interconnecting connectors of desired components to a network, e.g., an Ethernet network, thus interconnecting the desired components with each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In any case, component connectors are typically found on a rear panel of the component and are marked by various icons that are often molded into the panel as raised and/or indented markings. Different icons are used to distinguish between the various interfaces. For example, a component may have a SCSI interface, a parallel interface, and an Ethernet interface, just to name a few. Each interface connector may have a corresponding icon (or other marking, such as wording) to indicate the type of interface. These icons or other markings are often difficult to discern, due to their size, lack of contrast with the surrounding panel, or color of the icon and panel. Further, as can be appreciated by those skilled in the art, these types of interconnections are at times made in less than ideal lighting, as the components are often in cabinets, racks, or other enclosures. Thus, it may be very difficult to determine which connectors are to be interconnected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Other difficulties can arise as different interfaces may have common types of connectors. For example, a SCSI interface may employ a Centronics&trade;-type connector, which is also a common parallel interface connector. Further, a serial interface may use a DB25-type D-shell connector, while some SCSI interfaces use the same connector. Interconnecting different interfaces (e.g., interconnecting a parallel interface with a SCSI interface) results in a non-operative interconnection and may, in certain instances, damage one or more components being interconnected. At very least, misconnected interfaces can result in lost time and, if damage to one or more components results, can result in significant asset losses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> While interconnecting and troubleshooting various interfaces, it can be desirable to know whether the interface is interconnected and working properly. Often the operating condition of the interface is determined via software utilities executed on, for example, the primary computer module or by attempting to access one or more of the components via the primary computer module. Making the necessary connections, often at the rear of the components being interconnected, then running these utilities can be cumbersome and time consuming. In many instances, it would be beneficial to determine the condition of an interface, after making the connections, without leaving the rear of the component. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> While the invention is susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, specific embodiments thereof have been shown by way of example in the drawings and are herein described in detail. It should be understood, however, that the description herein of specific embodiments is not intended to limit the invention to the particular forms disclosed, but, on the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. </paragraph>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Illustrative embodiments of the invention are described below. In the interest of clarity, not all features of an actual implementation are described in this specification. It will of course be appreciated that in the development of any such actual embodiment, numerous implementation-specific decisions must be made to achieve the developers&apos; specific goals, such as compliance with system-related and business-related constraints, which will vary from one implementation to another. Moreover, it will be appreciated that such a development effort might be complex and time-consuming, but would nevertheless be a routine undertaking for those of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> According to the illustrated embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> computer system component <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> (e.g., a primary computer system module, a printer, an external storage media drive, or the like) has one or more connectors <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> (only one illustrated) on a rear panel <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> for interconnecting the computer system component <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> with another component (not shown). Such interconnections are often accomplished by attaching one end of a multi-conductor electrical cable (not shown) to the connector <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and attaching the other end of the multi-conductor cable to an electrical connector on the other component. While the connector <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is illustrated to be a D-shell connector, any type of connector (e.g., D-shell, Centronics&trade;, DIN, RJ-type, or the like) is within the scope of the present invention. A luminescent icon <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is provided, corresponding to the connector <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, to identify the type of interface associated with the connector <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The luminescent icon <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> gives off its own light or glows when in an active state. While, in the illustrated case, the luminescent icon <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> identifies the connector <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> as providing a connection to a SCSI interface, the form of the luminescent icon <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> represents whatever type of interface the connector <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> happens to be. For example, if the connector <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> provides a connection to a parallel printer interface, the luminescent icon <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> corresponds to a symbol representing the parallel printer interface; if the connector <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> provides a connection to an Ethernet interface, the form of the luminescent icon <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is chosen to represent the Ethernet interface. The luminescent icon <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> can be an integral part of the rear panel <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> or a faceplate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> that is inserted into the rear panel <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Further, the luminescent icon <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> can be part of, attached to, integrated with, or adjacent any portion of the computer system component <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, an embodiment of the present invention provides a light pipe <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> having a body portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and a formed portion <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. The formed portion <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> transitions from a cross-sectional shape of the body portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> to a cross-sectional shape of the luminescent icon <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> at an end <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. Thus, in the illustrated example, the formed portion <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> transitions from a round cross-section (the shape of the body portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>) to a shape of a SCSI icon (the shape of the end <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>). In the illustrated embodiment, a red light-emitting diode (LED) <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and a green LED <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> comprise a light source <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> capable of emitting light that propagates through the body portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and the formed portion <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> of the light pipe <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and is emitted at the end <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. Thus, in a certain situation, a direct current is passed through the red LED <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and no current is passed through the green LED <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> so that a red light is emitted from the end <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. In another situation, a direct current is passed through the green LED <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> and no current is passed through the red LED <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> so that a green light is emitted from the end <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. In yet another situation, an alternating current, (e.g., a 60-Hz alternating current) is passed through each of the red LED <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and the green LED <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> so that a yellow light is emitted from the end <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. Since the LEDs <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> are diodes, which allow current to pass only in one direction, applying the alternating current to the LEDs <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> causes the LEDs <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> to blink. If a sufficiently high-frequency alternating current is used to drive the LEDs <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, the LEDs <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> blink at a rate faster than can be detected by a human eye. Thus, a yellow light appears to be emitted from the end <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the present invention, a yellow light (or light that appears to be yellow to the human eye) is emitted from the light source <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> (and thus the end <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>) if no component is interconnected with the interface corresponding to the luminescent icon <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. Further, a green light is emitted from the light source <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> (and thus the end <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>) if a component is interconnected with the interface corresponding to the luminescent icon <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and the interface is operating correctly. Yet further, a red light is emitted from the light source <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> (and thus the end <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>) if a component is interconnected with the interface corresponding to the luminescent icon <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and the interface is not operating properly. While this color scheme has been described, the present invention encompasses any desired color scheme for light emitted from the light source <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> and the end <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> While two LEDs <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> are illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, they may be packaged in one molding as one two-color LED. Further, the scope of the present invention encompasses any light source <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> capable of emitting light into the light pipe <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, for example, an incandescent lamp, a florescent lamp, a neon lamp, or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Light pipes (such as light pipe <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>) are typically made of a transparent material (e.g., silica, polycarbonate, or the like) that usually is drawn into a cylindrical, pyramidical, conical, or other shape through which light is channeled from one end to the other generally by internal reflections. Optical fibers, which are examples of light pipes, are thin filaments of drawn or extruded glass or plastic having a central core and a cladding of a material that promotes internal reflection. Optical fibers may be used singly or in bundles to transmit light or images. Accordingly, the light pipe <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> can be any suitable variety of light pipe, optical fiber, or bundle of optical fibers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, the illustrated embodiment provides the end <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> of the light pipe <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> inserted into a shaped cutout <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> in a panel <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. The panel <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> can be any desired panel, for example the rear panel <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, the faceplate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, or the like. The end <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> can be disposed within the shaped cutout <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, adhesively attached within the shaped cutout <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, or the panel <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> can be molded around the end <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. While the light pipe <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> as having a round cross-sectional shape, the light pipe <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> may be of any shape as required to fit the application. Thus, by viewing the outside surface <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> of the panel <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> while light is being emitted from the end <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> of the light pipe <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, a luminescent icon <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> is appreciated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>, a panel <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> is provided having a shaped cutout <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>. An end <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> of a light pipe <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> is disposed adjacent the inside surface <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> of the panel <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> and generally covering the shaped cutout <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>. Light is emitted from a light source (not shown), propagates through the light pipe <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>, and is emitted from the end <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>. The shaped cutout <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> allows the light to pass therethough, while the panel <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> masks the light and prevents it from propagating beyond the inside surface <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> of the panel <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>. Thus, by viewing the outside surface <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> of the panel <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> while light is being emitted from the end <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> of the light pipe <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>, a luminescent icon <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> is appreciated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> It is within the scope of the present invention for the end <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> to be a different dimension or cross-sectional shape than another portion or portions of the light pipe <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>. Further, in the embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>, a panel <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> has an opening <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> sized to accept an end <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> of a light pipe <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight>. Instead of the panel <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> acting as a mask (as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>), a mask <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> is provided to prevent light from propagating from desired areas of the end <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> of the light pipe <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight>. Thus, by viewing the outside surface <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> of the panel <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> while light is being emitted from the end <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> of the light pipe <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight>, a luminescent icon <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> is appreciated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</cross-reference>, the illustrated embodiment provides a panel <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> having a shaped cutout <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>. An electroluminescent panel <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight> is disposed adjacent an inside surface <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> of the panel <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> and generally covering the shaped cutout <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>. One example of the electroluminescent panel <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight> is a sandwich-like device in which a phosphorescent layer is disposed between two electrodes. The phosphorescent layer emits light when a current is passed between the electrodes via wiring <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated embodiment, the shaped cutout <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> allows portions of the light, emitted from the electroluminescent panel <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight>, to pass therethough, while the panel <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> masks a portion of the light emitted from the electroluminescent panel <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight> and prevents it from propagating beyond the inside surface <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> of the panel <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight>. Thus, by viewing an outside surface <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> of the panel <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> while light is being emitted from the electroluminescent panel <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight>, a luminescent icon <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight> is appreciated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Similar to the embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>, the embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</cross-reference> provides a panel <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> that has an opening <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight> sized to accept an electroluminescent panel <highlight><bold>1112</bold></highlight>. Instead of the panel <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> acting as a mask (as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</cross-reference>), a mask <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> is provided to prevent light from propagating from desired areas of the electroluminescent panel <highlight><bold>1112</bold></highlight>. The electroluminescent panel <highlight><bold>1112</bold></highlight> is powered via wiring <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight>. Thus, by viewing an outside surface <highlight><bold>1108</bold></highlight> of the panel <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> while light is being emitted from the electroluminescent panel <highlight><bold>1112</bold></highlight>, a luminescent icon <highlight><bold>1110</bold></highlight> is appreciated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</cross-reference>, a faceplate <highlight><bold>1302</bold></highlight> is provided having a shaped cutout <highlight><bold>1304</bold></highlight>, as in previous embodiments. The shaped cutout <highlight><bold>1304</bold></highlight> is generally filled with a translucent material <highlight><bold>1306</bold></highlight>, which seals off the faceplate <highlight><bold>1302</bold></highlight> while allowing light to pass through the shaped cutout <highlight><bold>1304</bold></highlight>. A translucent material, such as the translucent material <highlight><bold>1306</bold></highlight>, may also generally fill the cutouts <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight> and/or open spaces in the masks <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> A method according to the present invention includes emitting a light from a light source and forming the light into a shape corresponding to a luminescent icon. In one embodiment, light is emitted from the light source if a predetermined condition exists (e.g., power is applied to the system, etc.) In another embodiment, light is emitted from the light source having a color corresponding to a predetermined condition. In one situation, the method includes emitting a yellow light from the light source if a component is not interconnected with the interface corresponding to the luminescent icon. A green light is emitted from the light source if the component is interconnected with the interface corresponding to the luminescent icon and the interface is operating properly. A red light is emitted from the light source if the component is interconnected with the interface corresponding to the luminescent icon and the interface is not operating properly. In one embodiment, proper operation of a computer system component is determined based upon a color of light emitted from the luminescent icon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In another method according to the present invention, light is emitted from the light source and a portion of the light is masked to prevent the masked portion of light from propagating. An unmasked portion of the light corresponds to the shape of the luminescent icon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The present invention further encompasses an apparatus having means for performing certain embodiments of the method of the invention described herein and their equivalents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The particular embodiments disclosed above are illustrative only, as the invention may be modified and practiced in different but equivalent manners apparent to those skilled in the art having the benefit of the teachings herein. Furthermore, no limitations are intended to the details of construction or design herein shown, other than as described in the claims below.
