<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Technical Field </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates generally to mounting devices, and more particularly to mounting devices used for attaching a microphone or other accessory onto a musical instrument. More specifically, the invention relates to a mounting device that is adapted to engage the lugs on the side of a drum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> When bands perform, amplifying the sound of both the singer&apos;s voice and the musical instruments may be desirable so that the music and the singer may be clearly heard by the audience. In order for the sound of an instrument to be heard, a microphone may be positioned in close proximity to the instrument to clearly pick up the sound. At other times, the musician may wish to use other musical accessories such as bells, small music stands or the like. Free standing stands may be used, but the stands are easily knocked over if they get in the way of the performers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A number of devices have been suggested in the prior art for mounting accessories, such as microphones and other small instruments, directly onto musical instruments and more specifically onto drums. Examples of this prior art include U.S. patents granted to Cohen (U.S. Pat. No. 4,466,596) and Wolf (U.S. Pat. No. Des. No. 305,026). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> These devices have utilized clamping type jaws for grasping the rims of drums. While these devices have worked, they are somewhat time consuming to apply, requiring a fair amount of adjustment both during attachment and removal, and can potentially damage the rim of the drum if the user is not paying sufficient attention. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The device of the present invention is an accessory mounting device that is adapted to be attached to a musical instrument, such as a drum. The device includes a base, a connector mounted on the base and an accessory support mounted on the base. When the device is mounted on a drum for example, the base engages the side of the drum and the connector engages a drum lug. The accessory, such as a microphone, is attached to the support.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The following description outlines how the mounting device of the present invention may be used in association with a drum. The mounting device may however be used to attach an accessory to other musical instruments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the accessory mounting device of the present invention, shown generally at <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, is adapted to engage a drum lug <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> mounted on the side <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of a drum <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Mounting device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> includes a base <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which may be manufactured from metal, plastic, wood or any other suitable material. Base <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> defines an inner surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and an outer surface <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. First and second legs <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> extend from opposite ends of base <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. First and second legs may be formed as an integral part of base <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or may be mounted on base <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by a suitable means. Alternatively, one of the first and second legs <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be formed as an integral part of base <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, while the other of the first and second legs <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be mounted on base <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Base <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> defines a channel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in outer surface <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of base <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Channel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be shaped, being essentially flat (<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>) proximate second leg <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and convexly curved (<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>) proximate first leg <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> First and second feet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> extend from the ends of first and second legs <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Feet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may be manufactured from any resilient material such as rubber. First foot <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be glued onto the end of first leg <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> or may be received within a recess (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>) at the end of first leg <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. First foot <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may also be attached with a suitable connector such as a screw, a nail etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Second leg <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> defines a longitudinal bore <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> through which a threaded or partially threaded shaft <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is inserted. Shaft <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> has stopper <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> at one end and second foot <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> at the other end. Shaft <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> may be loosely received within longitudinal bore <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Stopper <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> prevents shaft <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> from being completely withdrawn from bore <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Second foot <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is mounted on nut <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> so that foot <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has a firm base. Second foot <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is preferably a resilient pad which is shaped so as to enable it to more fully engage curved side <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of drum <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. A knurled adjuster nut <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is disposed between nut <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and inner end <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of second leg <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. When adjuster nut <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> abuts inner end <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of second leg <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, rotation of adjuster nut <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> causes second foot <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to be moved toward or away from upper end <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Adjuster nut <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> engages threads <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> on shaft <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Shaft <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, nut <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and adjuster nut <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are preferably made from a suitable metal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Base <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> further includes an accessory holder <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> for receiving and holding an accessory <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. Base <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> defines an aperture <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> that receives a portion of holder <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. A shock pin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> inserted in aperture <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Aperture <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is disposed in an area of base <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> adjacent first leg <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Shock pin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> includes a shaft <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> having a first end <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, a second end <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and an area of greater diameter <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> proximate its middle. First end <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of shaft <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is externally threaded and second end <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> includes pin bore <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Shaft <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is surrounded by a resilient shock absorber <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. Pin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and absorber <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are secured together at first end <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of shaft <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> with a washer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and a connector <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> that prevents shaft <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> from moving upwardly with respect to connector <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. Pin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and absorber <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are frictionally held within aperture <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> A mount tube <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, being internally threaded on one end <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and externally threaded on the other end <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, may be screwed onto end <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of shock pin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. An internally threaded jam nut <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is used to secure accessory <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> (such as a microphone) onto tube <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Shock pin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and mount tube <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> are shown as two separate components, but may be formed as a single unit without departing from the scope of this invention. Both shock pin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and mount tube <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> may be made from metal, plastic, wood or other suitable material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> A slot <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is provided in the inner surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of base <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, intermediate first and second legs <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Slot <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> opens into channel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. A portion of latching member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> for securing device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to drum lug <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is received within slot <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. Latching member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may be any suitable mechanism which engages and secures base <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to lug <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. In the drawings, latching member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> includes a shaft <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> that has a hole <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> proximate one end. Hole <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is normal to the longitudinal axis of shaft <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and is adapted to receive a roll pin <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> therethrough. The other end of shaft <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> includes a hook <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> which extends between first and second legs <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> when shaft <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is received within slot <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. Hook <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> may be configured with the curved end as shown in the drawings, or hook <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> may include a T-shaped end or a L-shaped end. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Latching member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> includes a lever <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> which is at least partially disposed within channel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Lever <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> may be substantially &ldquo;L&rdquo; shaped having a first longer arm <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and a second shorter arm <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. Lever <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> includes a hole <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> which is adapted to align with hole <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of latching member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Lever <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is secured to latching member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> by roll pin <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> being inserted through hole <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and hole <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. Latching member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is prevented from being withdrawn from slot <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> by lever <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and hook <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. Shaft <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of latching member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is loosely held within slot <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> so that hook <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> may be manipulated to engage drum lug <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Shaft <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> may be moved within slot <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> so that hook <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is moved away from or drawn closer to the inner surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Additionally, shaft <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> can be rotated within slot <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> so that hook <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> opens either toward first leg <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or second leg <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. This allows the user to select in which direction they wish to capture drum lug <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Shorter arm <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> of lever <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> may engage the curved portion of channel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to lock lever <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> in the closed position as will be further described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> While latching member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> has been described above as including shaft <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, hook <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> lever <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, any other suitable lug engaging latching member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may be used. For example, a flexible cord (not shown) may be looped around lug <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, drawn through slot <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and secured by a clamp (not shown) that creates enough tension in the cord to hold base <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> on drum <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The clamp may be a nut and threaded rod combination that allows the user to vary the tensile force in the cord. In another embodiment, shaft <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> may have a threaded portion that receives a nut. Rotation of the nut against body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> would create a tensile force in shaft <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> to hold body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in place. Various other tension-creating devices and arrangements may be used to hold body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> onto drum <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the device of the present invention is used in the following manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Base <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is brought into close proximity to side <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of drum <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. First foot <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is placed against side <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and hook <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is moved behind drum lug <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> by manipulating lever <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>). The user then rotates adjuster nut <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to move second foot <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> into contact with side <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. Longer arm <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of lever <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is rotated toward second leg <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in the manner shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. This draws hook <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> into contact with drum lug <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The user continues to rotate longer arm <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> until it reaches the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> where lever <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> locks in a first position. Continued rotation of longer arm <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> until edge <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> contacts outer surface <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> of second leg <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is possible. This movement brings shorter arm <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> into contact with the curved surface of channel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and also draws hook <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> further down toward the inner surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of base <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. When edge <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> contacts outer surface <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, lever <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is locked in a second position. This second position may be required in certain situations where drum lug <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is not securely gripped when latching member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is in the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. Care must be taken not to grip drum lug <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> too tightly as this may cause damage to the drum <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Microphone <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is then secured to mount tube <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> by screwing jam nut <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> into place to grip it. In the situation where shaft <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is rotated so that hook <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> opens toward second leg <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, lever <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is rotated in an opposite direction to that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 through 10</cross-reference>. Lever <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is rotated by the user&apos;s finger (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> When hook <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is fully engaged with drum lug <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and is locked into position as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the opposing action of second foot <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> engaging side <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> by virtue of shaft <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> being held in place by adjuster nut <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, serves to urge base <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> into engagement with side <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of drum <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. This securely holds the device in place against side <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the drum <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and provides a firm and secure footing for an accessory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 through 10</cross-reference>, when microphone <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is to be detached from drum <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, jam nut <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is loosened and microphone <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is removed. If the user so desires, microphone <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> may be left attached to mount tube <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and mount tube <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is simply unscrewed from shock pin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The user then rotates lever <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> in an opposite direction to that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 9</cross-reference>. As lever <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> rotates, hook <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> disengages from drum lug <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The user then moves second leg <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> off side <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> in such a manner that hook <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> clears drum lug <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. First leg <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is then pulled away from side <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the device may be stored for future use. </paragraph>
