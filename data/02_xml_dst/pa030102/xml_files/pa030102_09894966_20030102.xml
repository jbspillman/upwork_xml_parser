<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Electronic messaging or &ldquo;email&rdquo; has become one of the most frequently used communications tools of the modern world. In fact, email has become a preferred means of communication in both private and commercial settings. Email is used to communicate every form of information including, but not limited to, confidential and, often, personal information. Unfortunately, email often is communicated to unintended recipient parties (individuals and groups) simply because a sender does not confirm correctness of a specified recipient&apos;s address information (e.g., an email address&mdash;such as JOE&commat;domainname.com). The risks associated with such erroneous message transmission are exacerbated by the fact that often a single click of a messaging client toolbar button (e.g., a SEND button) can result in sending email to unintended, and, possibly, unknown parties (as in the case of incorrectly responding to unsolicited email). Accordingly, it can be said that such unintended email transmissions result from a general lack of safeguards provided by messaging client applications. And, as communications technologies have and continue to develop beyond email into instant messaging, and other non-voice-to-voice modes, for example, the problems associated with erroneous transmission are compounded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Thus, there exists a need to provide new and improved systems and methods that will help senders of email and other similar messages (e.g., instant messages) to send their messages to actually intended recipients and to avoid erroneous transmission of messages. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The present invention solves the aforementioned problems associated with prior systems and methods used for transmission of email and other similar or like messages. In particular, the present invention permits users of messaging systems such as email systems, instant messaging systems, wireless phone-to-phone systems, etc., to confirm the specification of addressing information (e.g., email addresses) prior to transmission of their messages. Accordingly, the present invention improves existing email and other similar and like messaging systems by providing a level of personal security and comfort in that senders of messages can assure themselves that messages will be sent to actually intended recipients. As such, the present invention promotes message confidentiality and, ultimately, security. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In achieving the aforementioned benefits, the present invention provides systems and methods that include and involve generation means for permitting a sender to generate an email message to be sent to a specified recipient via a messaging system, confirmation means for confirming that the email message is to be sent to the specified recipient by presenting to the sender a confirmation notice requesting the sender to confirm that the specified recipient is an intended recipient of the email message, and sending means for causing the email message to be sent to the specified recipient via the messaging system after the sender operates the confirmation means and confirms that the specified recipient is an intended recipient. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The present invention is now described in detail with regard to the drawing figures that were briefly described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, depicted there is a diagram of a system in which a sender can generate a message such as an electronic mail (email) message, an instant network message, a wireless phone-type instant message, etc. and confirm recipient addressing information prior to actual transmission in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. In particular, within system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, a sender <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may generate an email message E in a conventional way such as by way of a compose function of an email client application running within a personal computer system&mdash;e.g., a MIME Compliant/Formatted email message. Such an email message E may sent via the sender&apos;s ISP and email provider <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and via a network <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> (such as the Internet), and through a recipient&apos;s ISP and email provider <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> for ultimate receipt by a recipient <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. In accordance with the present invention, sender <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may confirm the specification of recipient <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> prior to actual transmission of email message E to recipient <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. As will be discussed below with regard to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 through 5</cross-reference>C, such a novel confirmation may take the form of presentation of dialog box type confirmation notices in conjunction with graphic displays, audio voicing of email addresses, or via other multimedia manifestations which are presented to sender <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> within his email client application. Such confirmation notices may take the form of audio streams (voicing of email addresses), video presentations, or combinations thereof to present confirmation notices that can be used by sender <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to confirm that a particular sender is an actual intended recipient of email message E. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The present invention contemplates the use of conventional email systems and technologies to transport email messages across a network such as via the Internet, within an Intranet, or within any other automated data processing environment utilizing networking and conventional messaging technologies. Moreover, the present invention certainly contemplates the application of the confirmation technologies provided herein in the context of other messaging systems such as within instant messaging systems, messaging technologies utilized in wireless applications such as instant phone-to-phone communications, etc. Accordingly, references to email are intended to be broad based and certainly contemplate alternative messaging systems and services (e.g., instant messaging, etc.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In the case of email communications, for example, the field or fields within a messaging scheme which hold the names and addresses of intended recipients of the email (for example, a primary email recipient, cc: addresses, blind cc: addresses, etc.) are specified by the sender of the email. On sending an email message, these fields are evaluated so that confirmation notices are provided in accordance with the present invention. Such confirmation notices may be voiced in conjunction with dialog boxes presented on a screen, for example, etc. Such voice confirmation notices may take the form of &ldquo;Are you sure you want to send this email message to &lsquo;alfred&commat;hotmail.com&rsquo;, having email address &lsquo;a-l-f-r-e-d&commat;h-o-t-m-a-i-l.com&rsquo;&quest; . . . . If yes, click OK and, if not, click Cancel or NO.&rdquo; Accordingly, the present invention can be configured to look for a response by the sender in order to actually transmit a message such as an email message to an intended recipient. Accordingly, the present invention prevents email messages from being sent to unintended individuals, and aids senders to not disclose information to unintended parties. Those skilled in the art will immediately appreciated that the nature and language of a confirmation notice/dialog provided by the present invention may take on any definition that suits particular design and implementation requirements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, depicted therein is a block diagram of an automatic data processing system that is configured in accordance with the present invention to facilitate the confirmation of email recipients in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Automated data processing system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is one that may be used by a sender in accordance with the present invention. Automated data processing system includes a processor arrangement <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> which is coupled to a data storage facility <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and to input and output (I/O) facilities <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> such as speakers within a sound card, a video monitor, a printer, etc. Those skilled in the art will immediately understand the arrangement shown within system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> as a computing platform which may be outfitted in accordance with the present invention to provide confirmation notices to confirm email recipients. Such an automated data processing system may be implemented using a personal computer similar or like an IBM compatible computer running the Microsoft&reg; Windows&trade; 98 operating system. Accordingly, I/O facilities <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> may include any type of computer peripheral device for providing, for example, audio streams such as automatically played email address voice streams, video displays, and combinations thereof (including multimedia presentations), to a sender in the context of a messaging client application (e.g., email client, a wireless phone-to-phone client application, an instant messaging client, etc.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, depicted therein is a block diagram that illustrates the modules and facilities such as objects that make up a software system provided by the present invention and that maybe executed within the data processing system depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> to facilitate confirmation of email recipient addressing information in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. In particular, software system <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> includes, among other software objects and routines, several modules for providing an email generation facility/module <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, an email recipient confirmation facility/module <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, and an email sending/transmission facility/module <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>. The interaction of facilities <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> is further discussed below with regard to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>A through <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, depicted therein an exemplary screen shot that illustrates the confirmation session that results from execution of a software system like or similar to one depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. In particular, an email client <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is shown as running within data processing system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Email client <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> may be similar in structure, appearance, and operation to Microsoft Outlook&reg; which is manufactured by Microsoft Corporation. Outlook&reg; is a trademark and/or registered trademark of Microsoft Corporation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Within email client <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, a sender has instantiated generation of a email message <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. Email message <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> includes an addressing information section <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> in which a sender will specify email/msg addresses of specified parties who may be considered intended recipients prior to confirmation, and body text/data forming part of email message <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> as body text section <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. Email message <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is a conventional email message and may be one that includes attachments and the like in a conventional way. Such an email message will be readily understood by those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Once email message <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> has been generated to the satisfaction of a sender, he/she may elect to transmit the message to his/her designated recipient(s). Such operation normally occurs within an email client like or similar to email client <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> by operation of a send button <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>. Upon clicking send button <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>, a confirmation sequence including the presentation of a confirmation dialog/notice <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> will presented to the sender. Confirmation dialog/notice <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> may also include the presentation of multimedia presentations including audio and video content. The essence of confirmation dialog/notice <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> is to allow the sender to confirm delivery and transmission of email message <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> to each one of the specified recipients as designated within addressing information section <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> of email message <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. The presentation of a dialog box and one that allows a user to select a YES/NO/CANCEL operation will be immediately understood by those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Confirmation dialog/notice <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> will present an inquiry in the form &ldquo;Do you really want to send this email message to afred&commat;hotmail.com&quest;&rdquo; Such an inquiry may take the form of a multimedia presentation including audio and video content as illustrated at audio content (speaker) <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, and video content <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> such as in the form of a picture or thumbnail image (e.g., a pre-stored .jpg, .gif, file, etc.) of or otherwise corresponding to a specified recipient. Accordingly, the present invention permits a audible message such as automated voicing of a person&apos;s email address or other stream (e.g., &ldquo;Your Best Friend Alfred&rdquo;) corresponding to a specified recipient to be played via speakers and other input/output facilities of a sender&apos;s data processing system, as well as the presentation of screen based image corresponding to a specified recipient. In this way, a sender will able to confirm and satisfy himself that he has properly specified the email address for the person/group to whom he intends his message to be sent. It is important to note that a key feature of the present invention is the ability to allow a sender to create and specify a mapping form identifying data relating to a particular address (e.g., an email address, a phone number, an instant messaging address, etc.) to a particular person/group&mdash;e.g., a sender may configure his email client provided in accordance with the present invention to show a family picture corresponding to his best friend, or to play a wedding song to illustrate correspondence to his wife&apos;s email address. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The structures and operations discussed above are designed and intended to operate together to provide the functionality described in detail herein. To illustrate such resultant functionality, reference is now made to the flowchart illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> With specific reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>A, depicted therein is a flowchart that illustrates method steps involved in facilitating confirmation of email recipients and corresponding addressing information in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. In particular, processing and operations start a step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and immediately proceed to step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. At step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a sender will instantiate an email client or similar messaging client such as the one depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> to derive a screen display image similar or like the one shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Such operation may occur as a result of running an email client within a Windows&trade; based operating system running on a automated data processing system such system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Next, at step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the sender will generate an email message addressed to one or more recipients (e.g., to alfred&commat;hotmail.com). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Next, at step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the sender will cause the email message to be sent by the email client such as via a clicking operation of SEND button <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Next, at step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, a confirmation dialog/notice will be presented to the sender. Such a dialog/notice may include multimedia content, including audio content, video content, as well as combinations thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Processing and operations continue at step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> at the top of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> At step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, a determination will be made as to whether the sender wants to send the email message to a particular specified recipient. Such an inquiry may include the presentation of audio content, video content or via other multimedia content manifestation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> If the determination at step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is affirmative, processing proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. At step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the email client will send/transmit the email message to the specified recipient via a network connection such as via the Internet, via some form of communications network (e.g., a wireless communications network), etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, processing and operations end at step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. However, if the sender specified more than one recipient within the address information of a particular email message the sequence shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference> can be repeated based on the number of recipients specified by the sender, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> If the determination at step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is negative, processing and operations continue at step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> at the top of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In particular, at step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the email client will return the sender to the email message editing/composition session or present some other type of dialog to the sender to indicate that the sender has confirmed that the specified recipient is otherwise not intended. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Processing and operations end at step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Thus, having fully described the present invention by way of example with reference to the attached drawing figures, it will be readily appreciated that many changes and modifications may be made to the invention and to any of the exemplary embodiments shown and/or described herein without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention which is defined in the appended claims. </paragraph>
