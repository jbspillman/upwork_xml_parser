<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Within the recent past the use of mosquito killing devices has become well known in the prior art. Known insect or mosquito attracting and killing devices typically use light for attracting target insects. Target insects drawn towards the apparatus contact an electrocution grid for subsequent eradication. By way of example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,182,069, 4,523,404 and 5,301,458 as well as U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,020,270, 3,319,374, 3,041,773, 4,454,677 and 4,852,296 all employ light for attracting insects towards an electrocution grid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,255,468 issued to Cheshire, Jr. discloses an insect attracking and capturing apparatus having a light source to attract insects and a fan to create an air current for capturing the insects in the air current created and delivering the insects to a electrified grid for electrocution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,951,414 issued to Mewissen discloses a device for electrocuting insects having a housing with a low pressure, mercury vapor discharge light therein. An electrically connected ballast for illuminating the mercury vapor lamp also generates voltage for electrifying the insect eradication grid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Other interesting devices of general relevance include U.S. Pat. No. 5,205,064 issued to Nolen. It discloses a generally cylindrical device having a pressurized canister and a cam mechanism for periodically discharging the contents of the canister to attract insects for electrocution. U.S. Pat. No. 4,696,126 issued to Grothaus, et al., shows a device that uses an electric grid to temporarily shock flying insects and trap them on a sticky paper. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Some known devices employ different attractants. U.S. Pat. No. 4,891,904 issued to Tabita discloses a heating device for electrocuting mosquitoes that has a passive heating assembly disposed within an interior chamber. U.S. Pat. No. 5,241,779 issued to Lee discloses an apparatus for collecting and killing insects having a passive heat source, a sweet liquid attractant, and a killing grid for electrocuting crawling insects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 6,050,025 issued to Wilbanks discloses an insect killing system including a fan and an inner shell with openings in the shell. </paragraph>

The cylindrical outer protection shield <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> has a plurality of large openings <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> that easily permit insects to pass through and is attached to the downwardly sloping outer portion <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> of the roof <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. Both the outer protective shield <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and the roof <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> are made of insulating plastic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The inner shell <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is in the form of a cylinder and has a top end <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and a bottom end <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The inner shell <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is painted black in color in order to attract the insects. The top end of the shell includes a plurality of openings <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> for permitting air to be drawn inside the inner shell <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. In other embodiments, other types of openings can be used. Near the bottom end of the inner shell <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the inner shell <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> has the plurality of gas ejecting openings <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. More specifically, there are eight openings in one horizontal row <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> around the inner shell <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and eight openings in a second row <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. The openings in the second row <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> are spaced between and below the openings in the first row <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. Each opening <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is formed by a cut in the inner shell <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> with the material below the cut being indented inwardly towards the center of the inner shell <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Each opening thus has the horizontal hole <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> into the interior of the inner shell <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Each hole <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> permits gas to be ejected from the inside of the inner shell <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in a downward and outward fashion. The indentations <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> that form the opening <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, however, help prevent horizontal entry into the inner shell, such as by rain, wind or insects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The mosquito killing system or apparatus electrical means <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> surrounding the inner shell <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is in the form of an outer network of electrified low voltage wires <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> in a spaced apart relationship. The wire network dehydrates and kills any insects which pass through network of wires. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The wire network <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is positioned around the inner shell <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> by means of a cap <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> and an upper collar <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. More specifically, the wire network includes the cylindrical inner grid <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> of wires made from galvanized hardware cloth closely adjacent to the outside surface of the inner shell <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Placed around the top of the inner grid on the outside of the inner grid <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> circumferentially around the inner shell <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is an insulating, high temperature, plastic sheet <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>. The sheet <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> covers a portion of the end of the inner grid <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. The plastic sheet <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> is held on the inner shell <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> by the upper collar <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. The upper collar <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is held on the cap <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> fastened such as by glue to the top of the inner shell <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> by an inwardly tapered fit between the collar <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and the cap <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. The plastic sheet <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> forms an extra current creep length between the inner grid <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> and the outer grid <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. The outer grid <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is mounted on the outside of the upper collar <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> by means such as rivets. The outer grid <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is held in a spaced position relative to the inner grid <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> by the upper collar <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and the rigidity of the outer grid <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Attached by means such as glue to the outside of the bottom of the inner shell <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, below the openings <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, is a plastic lower collar <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>. The plastic collar <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> forms a lower portion of the inner shell <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. In other less preferred embodiments, the lower collar <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> can be omitted. An annular bag support bracket <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> is mounted on the outside surface of the lower collar <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>. This support bracket <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> includes an inner ring <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>, an outer ring <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight>, and tabs <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> extending between the inner and outer rings to support the outer ring <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> relative to the inner ring <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> and to create openings between the rings forming the support bracket <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>. The support bracket <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> is held on the lower collar <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> by means such as glue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The bag <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is made of netting formed in a cylinder with elastic in one end holding the one bag end on the other ring <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> of the bag support bracket <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>. Elastic in the other end holds the other bag end on the cup <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> above the cup <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The mosquito killing apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> further includes a cup <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> for holding the liquid <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> including the mosquito attractant. The cup <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> is held in the lower collar <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> by a plastic screw <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> that extends through a threaded hole in the lower collar <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> that holds the cup <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>. The screw <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> engages and holds the cup <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> in place. In other embodiments, other means for attaching the cup to the inner shell can be used, such a screw thread (not shown) in the top of the cup and in the lower collar. In the preferred embodiment, the mosquito attractant is a food grade lactic acid. In other embodiments, other attractants can be used, both for attracting mosquitoes as well as other nuisance insects. In other embodiments, a stand (not shown) can be added to receive the inner shell <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the cup <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> to support the apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> so the apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be placed on the ground. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The mosquito apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> further includes a wick <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> supported within the cup <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> which extends down into the liquid <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. The fabric wick <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> is held within the cup <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> by a retaining ring <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight>. The retaining ring <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> is a ring with a missing segment. The top of the wick <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> is wrapped over the retaining ring <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight>. The ring <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> can then be compressed inwardly, fitted inside the top of the cup <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> and then released in order to expand and hold the wick <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> inside the cup <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>. The cup <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> is formed from a cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> and a lower cap <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> attached to the bottom of the cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>. In the preferred embodiment, the cup is formed from PVC material. In other less preferred embodiments, a one-piece cup can be used, as well as being made from other materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The mosquito attracting device <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> comprises a bracket <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. On the upper end of the bracket <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is an annular fan mounting support plate <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. The support plate <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is attached to the upper end of the bracket <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. The AC fan <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> for blowing air from the top of the inner shell <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> towards the bottom is mounted on the annular support plate <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. In other embodiments, a DC fan or a variable speed fan can be used. Mounted on the bracket <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> beneath the fan <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is the solenoid valve <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Mounted on the bracket <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> beneath the solenoid valve <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is an electrical transformer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> for converting household voltage to the high voltage (4000 volts) required for the wire network <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. One end (not shown) of the high voltage side of the transformer extends to the outer grid <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and the other end (not shown) of the high voltage side of the transformer extends to the inner grid <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. Any mosquitoes which pass between the grids thus cause current to flow between the grids. This kills the mosquitoes. Mounted on the lower end of the bracket <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is a light socket <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. Within the light socket <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is the 60-watt black light bulb <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> which extends away from the bracket <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> towards the bottom of the mosquito killing apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In other less preferred embodiments, other heat sources or other light bulbs can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The annular support plate <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and the bracket <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> fit inside the top end of the inner shell <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, with the black light bulb <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> at the bottom on the inner shell <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The bracket <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is attached to the inner shell <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> by means such as rivets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The mosquito attracting device <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> further includes a CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>line <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. One end of the line <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> is attached to a regulator (not shown) on a CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>source of supply, such as a CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>tank (not shown). The CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>line <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> includes a first passageway <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> in communication with the source of CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and in communication with an inlet (not shown) to the solenoid valve <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. The CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>line <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> further includes a second passageway <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> in communication with the outlet (not shown) of the solenoid valve <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and in communication with an opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> to the interior of the inner shell <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> adjacent to the black light bulb <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The mosquito attracting device <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> further includes a variable size orifice <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> in the CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>line <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> for varying the amount of CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>that the device <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> ejects in order to attract mosquitoes. More particularly, the second passageway <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> includes a first tube <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> extending between the solenoid valve outlet and the variable size orifice mounted in the top of the mosquito killing apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The second passageway <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> further includes a second tube <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> extending from the outlet (not shown) from the variable size orifice <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> down to adjacent the black light bulb <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The variable size orifice <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> includes an accessible screw in the top of the mosquito killing apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> so that a user of the system can vary the size of the orifice <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> to vary the amount of CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>which is ejected. In other embodiments, the variable size orifice <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> can be included in the first passageway. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The mosquito attracting device <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> further includes a temperature switch <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> in the inner shell <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> adjacent but spaced from the black light <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. Either a creep or snap type of temperature switch <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> can be used. In either case, the switch <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> is opened when the temperature goes below a selected value and is closed when the temperature goes above a selected value. In other less preferred embodiments, other subcontrollers, such as timers, can be used to determine the on characteristics of the CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>or the fan. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> As more particularly shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the mosquito killing apparatus electrical system includes an external source of power. Across the external source of supply is the transformer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, a diode <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> in series with the black light <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and the fan and solenoid control circuit <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. More particularly, the control circuit <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is across the source of supply. The control circuit <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is open when the temperature of the gasses within the inner shell <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are below a particular temperature. In the preferred embodiment, the temperature for the control circuit <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is 43 degrees Celsius. The control circuit <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is closed when the temperature within the inner shell <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> rises above a particular temperature. More particularly, the control circuit <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is opened and closed by the temperature switch <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> in parallel with a capacitor <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> and in series with a gate <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> to a triac <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>. The triac <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> is in series with the solenoid and fan in parallel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In an alternate embodiment, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> variable heat source can be used. More particularly the voltage across the light bulb <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> can be varied by a conventional light dimmer circuit <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight>, such as that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In yet another embodiment, the variable heat source can be provided by a switch <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>, such as that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, which provides either the full voltage across the light bulb <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> or half of the AC voltage across the light bulb <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. In the preferred embodiment, a 60-watt black light is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The operation of the mosquito killing apparatus is as follows: When connected to a source of power, the light bulb <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is turned on. The light bulb <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> heats the air around the bulb <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. This heated air is in communication with the wick <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> in the liquid <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> in the cup <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>. This causes the liquid to evaporate and to mix the mosquito attractant with the heated moist air. Once the heated air reaches the desired operating temperature, the control circuit <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> opens causing the solenoid valve <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> to open and the fan <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to turn on. Outside air is pulled into the top of the inner shell by the fan <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> through the openings <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The air is then forced in a downward direction along the inner shell <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. As the air moves along the inner shell <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, it mixes with the CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>being released by the CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>line including the solenoid valve <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and the variable size orifice <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>. The air and CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>mix with the heated air including the insect attractant, and is then forced out through the horizontal openings <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The warm, heated air including the attractant and CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>causes mosquitoes in the vicinity to be drawn to the apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. After the fan <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> operates causing the CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and moist air to be ejected from the inner shell <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the temperature within the inner shell is cooled to where the control circuit <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> again opens. The amount of time the fan is on and the CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is released will thus be dependent on both ambient air temperature and the moisture in the air. When the ambient air is cooler, there are fewer mosquitoes and the device <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> will be on less often. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The construction of the inner shell <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is such that the heated, moist air rises up where it accumulates within the inner shell <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> until the next time the fan <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> begins to operate and the CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is allowed to flow. In other less preferred embodiments, openings <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> can be provided over the entire inner shell <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Also, in other less preferred embodiments, other types of openings (not shown) into the inner shell <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> When the bulb <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> burns out, or when the liquid <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> in the cup <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> needs to be replenished, the cup <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> is removed from the lower collar <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>. This permits access to both the black light <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and the cup interior. </paragraph>
