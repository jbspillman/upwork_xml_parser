<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to a heart rate monitor and more particularly to an ambulatory heart rate monitor having multiple exercise profiles that may be selected in response to different exercise and/or physiological parameters. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A user&apos;s heart rate during exercise is measured with a heart rate monitor (HRM) in terms of the number of heartbeats that occur during a unit of time e.g., beats per minute. The HRM typically includes a chest unit that detects an electrical signal generated by the heart and displays the measured heart rate on a display unit. The display unit can additionally display indicators, such as predetermined heart rate limits or target zones. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Conventional ambulatory HRMs provide a single profile to guide a user during an exercise routine having a single set of parameters. For instance, if the user is running, the HRM can be programmed to indicate when the user&apos;s heart rate exceeds predetermined upper and lower limits during a jogging routine. These limits can also be programmed to be different at different times during the profile, such as lower during warm-up and cool-down portions and higher during an intermediate portion of the profile. These portions may be further subdivided into laps, sprints, and the like, which substantially complicates the process of programming the HRM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Entry of information associated with the profile is further complicated if the user performs different types of exercise routines requiring substantially different profiles, such as weightlifting, cycling, rowing, spinning, and the like. Programming of the HRM is even more complex if the user wants use and retain profiles having different intensities for the same activity under different circumstances, such as the day of the week and various physiological parameters. In either of these instances, the user is forced to reprogram the HRM with a different profile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Such a task is both time-consuming and impractical, particularly for users who alternate activities on a daily basis. The need to reprogram the HRM each day following an exercise routine for that particular day typically discourages the majority of users from performing each of their exercise routines with the HRM. This significantly limits the effectiveness of the HRM as a tool for maintaining the user&apos;s level of fitness. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The heart rate monitor formed in accordance with the present invention is a completely ambulatory device that enables an individual to exercise while being guided by a plurality of exercise profiles, at home, at a health club, or anywhere else. The heart rate monitor includes a sensor, which is preferably located on the user&apos;s chest, which detects the user&apos;s heartbeat from an electrical signal generated by the heart. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The monitor also displays a heart rate, which is calculated from the number of heartbeats that occur during a given interval of time. Such heart rate monitors are intended to include chest units that are wired to a display, chest units that wirelessly transmit heart rate data to a receiver and a display in a wrist unit, and heart rate monitors that operate solely on the wrist without a chest transmitter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a user <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> running on a treadmill <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The heartbeat of the user <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is detected by a transmitter electrode belt <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, which is preferably arranged on the user&apos;s chest. The heartbeat is detected with two or more electrodes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>B provided on the transmitter electrode belt <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. An electrical potential is generated between the electrodes in response to the beats. The transmitter electrode belt <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is attached around the user&apos;s body with, for instance, a band made of an elastic material. A signal representing the detected heartbeat is transmitted preferably inductively to a receiver <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> on the wrist, which preferably also includes a display for indicating the heart rate, such as beats per minute. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> As described above, the heart rate monitor may also be a wrist device, in which the transmitter and receiver are integrated in one device. The heartbeat may be detected by the wrist unit from either an electrocardiogram (ECG) signal, which is derived from two electrodes (e.g., a wrist electrode in contact with one of the user&apos;s arms and a finger electrode in contact with another of the user&apos;s arms), from an arterial pressure pulse, or by observing optically detectable changes in blood flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The electrode belt <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is shown in greater detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, which shows the electrode belt <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> from the side of the electrodes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>B, i.e. from the side facing the body of the user. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> also shows fasteners <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that attach the electrode belt <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to the elastic band, which is strapped around the body. A dotted line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> represents an electronics unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> for processing the heart rate information received from the electrodes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>B. The electrodes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>B are electrically connected to the electronics unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> by conductive lines <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a block diagram of the preferred embodiments of the electronics unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> on the transmitter electrode belt <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and a receiver <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, which is preferably worn on the user&apos;s wrist. The electronics unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is shown at the top of the figure, a sample of heartbeat information to be transmitted is shown in the middle of the figure, and a block representing the receiver unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is shown at the bottom of the figure. The electronics unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> receives the heartbeat information from the electrodes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>B. Alternatively, heart rate information may be processed in the electronics unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the transmitter <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and transmitted as a heart rate value to the receiver <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> From the electrodes, a heart rate signal is supplied to an amplifier <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> from which the signal is outputted to a power amplifier <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and then to a transmitter <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The transmitter <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is preferably implemented as a coil, which inductively transmits heartbeat information <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to the receiver, such as the receiver unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to be arranged on the user&apos;s wrist or to, for instance, an external computer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The heartbeat information <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may be transmitted inductively, optically, through a wired conductor, or alternative means well known in the art. In one embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the receiver <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, such as the receiver to be worn on the wrist, includes a receiver coil <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> from which the received signal is outputted to a processing unit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, such as a microcontroller or microprocessor, via a signal receiver or amplifier <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The processing unit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> controls and coordinates the operation of the different elements of the receiver <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The receiver <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> includes a memory device <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, which may be internal or external to the processing unit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, for storing heartbeat information. The receiver <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> also includes an indicating device and display <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> for displaying the heart rate and other variables and visually and/or audibly indicating when the user is outside a target heart rate zone. </paragraph>

The input device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is used to activate the monitor and to initiate different functional modes of the monitor. The input device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the present invention further enables the user to electronically enter or program information to be associated with a plurality of exercise profiles, such as heart rate limits and the duration of specified portions of the exercise profile, such as phases, interval periods, and recovery periods. The input device further preferably allows the user to electronically enter one or more exercise parameters (such as the day of the week, time, fitness level, exercise intensity, and the like) or physiological parameters unique to the user (such as weight, height, age, sex, self-reported exercise frequency, and the like). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> A phase refers to a specific portion of the duration of an exercise profile selected from the plurality of exercise profiles. A plurality of interval periods and recovery periods preferably exist during each phase. The interval period refers to the duration of time during which the user is substantially exercising and the recovery period refers to the duration of time during which the user is substantially at rest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The receiver <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> further includes the processing unit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, which performs a multiple exercise profile program. The method used by the program will be described in detail with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> below. In the preferred embodiment, the program is implemented in software using a general-purpose microprocessor or microcontroller. However, the method may also be implemented in an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), by discrete logic components, or by employing alternative means well known in the art. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a flowchart showing the top-level functions of the heart rate monitor formed in accordance with the present invention. The plurality of exercise profiles are programmed manually in step <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. While the user is exercising and the heart rate monitor is in a measure mode, heart rate information is stored in the heart rate monitor in step <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> It must be noted that the subject invention is able to guide the user in maintaining his heart rate within a target zone while performing a plurality of exercise routines. The heart rate monitor formed in accordance with the present invention accomplishes this by being able to store, revise, and manipulate a plurality of exercise profiles. Each of the exercise profiles may be tailored to a particular set of exercise or physiological parameters, thereby eliminating the need for the user to reprogram the heart rate monitor with a different exercise profile when switching between routines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The user may optionally review the heart rate information while in file mode in step <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, and may optionally download the heart rate information to a computer for further processing and analysis in step <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. As discussed above, the user may upload a pre-programmed plurality of profiles from a computer in step <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> rather than manually programming the plurality of profiles in step <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The user may also interrupt a currently running profile, phase, interval period, or recovery period while in the measure mode in step <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Step <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is shown in greater detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</cross-reference>, which detail the function of manually programming the plurality of profiles. Each of the plurality of exercise profiles is selected in step <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and the selected profile identifier is preferably displayed in step <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. The profile identifier may be modified by the user or retained as a numerical identifier. Heart rate limits or a target heart rate zone may be selected by the user for the selected profile in step <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> A phase in the selected profile is then selected in step <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, and the selected phase identifier is displayed in step <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. Like the profile identifier, the phase identifier may optionally be modified by the user or retained as a numerical identifier. The user may then choose to turn the selected phase on or off in step <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. As described above with respect to the profile, the user may set heart rate limits or a target heart rate zone for the selected phase in step <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight>. If the user chooses to turn the selected phase off, the user may then select the same or another profile by returning to step <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> via step <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> If the selected phase is determined to be turned on in step <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, the user will then select an interval period within the selected phase in step <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, and the selected interval period identifier will be displayed in step <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. As described above, the user may modify the interval period identifier or choose to retain a numerical identification of the selected interval period. The user can then choose to turn the selected interval on or off in step <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and if it is determined that the selected interval period is on in step <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, the type of interval period may be selected in step <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. As with the selected profile and selected phase, the user may select heart rate limits or a target heart rate zone for the selected interval period in step <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. If the user has chosen to turn the selected interval off in step <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the user may then select the same or another phase in step <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> via step <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The interval period types include manual, time-rate-based, and heart-rate-based. The manual interval period terminates in response to the user selecting a button on the heart rate monitor. The time-rate-based interval period terminates after a specified duration of time, and the heart-rate-based interval period terminates when a specified terminal heart rate has been achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> If the user selects a time-based interval period in step <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>B, the user will then select the minutes in step <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the seconds in step <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, which determine the duration of the selected interval period. If the user selects a heart-rate-based interval period in step <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, the user will select a terminal heart rate in step <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, which will terminate the selected interval period. The method then proceeds to step <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> to select the same or another phase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Following the determination that the selected phase is turned on in step <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>A, the user may select a recovery period within the selected profile and phase in step <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</cross-reference>. The selected recovery period identifier is then displayed in step <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, and the user may choose to turn the selected recovery period on or off in step <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. As with the profile, phase, and interval period, the recovery period identifier may be modified by the user or retained as a numerical identifier. If the selected recovery period has been determined to be on in step <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, the user will select the recovery period type in step <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. The user may select heart rate limits or a target heart rate zone for the selected recovery period as a means of implementing a biofeedback approach to induce relaxation between interval periods in step <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The recovery period may be time-based or heart-rate-based. The time-based recovery period terminates following a selected time period and the heart-rate-based recovery period terminates in response to a terminal heart rate being achieved. If the user selects a time-based recovery period in step <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, the user will then select the minutes in step <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and the seconds in step <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> after which the selected recovery period will terminate. If the user selects a heart-rate-based recovery period in step <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, the user will then select a terminal heart rate in step <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. The method will then return to select the same or another phase in step <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
