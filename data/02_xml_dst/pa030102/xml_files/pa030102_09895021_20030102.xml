<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The administration of network devices, such as network printers, in a network environment is typically a tedious and time consuming task for network managers. In particular, for large and complex network environments having several local servers, there may be a large number of printers distributed throughout the network. Many of the printers may be physically remote from the location of the network administrator. In traditional network environments, the network administrator has to travel to the location of each new printer to install the printer on the network and to configure the network settings, which can include the printer name and a unique IP address for the printer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The network administrator also may need to setup a corresponding print queue on a print server for the printer. The print server may be maintained in a local server or on another server which is remote from the printer. It can be appreciated that a large, complex network can have a great number of print servers to accommodate all printers on the network. A print queue is setup by the network administrator by entering information about the printer, such as network configuration information, as well as information regarding the printer name, printer functionality and capabilities, and the printer driver associated with the printer. In addition, the network administrator may setup the print queue based on additional information regarding which network users are allowed access to the printer, and what type of print jobs can be submitted to the printer. The network administrator then has to publish the new print queue for access by the appropriate network users. Accordingly, installation of a new printer may require the network administrator to work at the location of the new printer and at the location of the print server on which the new corresponding print queue is hosted. In such an environment, the print queues for all printers on the network are distributed in a diverse manner across several different servers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In addition to installing new printers on the network, the network administrator must go through a similar process each time a network printer is reconfigured. For example, a printer may be moved to another location and given another name for use by a different set of network users, or new capabilities may be added to the printer, or the network settings of the printer may be modified. In each case, the network administrator must make sure that the network server and the corresponding print queue are modified to reflect the changes. In addition, some of the foregoing changes may require notification to the appropriate user workstations to modify the corresponding printer settings on the workstation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In a large enterprise, such as a large, physically distributed company with large numbers of printers, the foregoing system administrative tasks related to network printers can be overwhelming. In addition to the network administration tasks associated with the printers, other network problems can arise in relation to the printers. For example, a large number of printers on the network can generate a significant amount of network traffic between the print servers and the printers. Network traffic can also be generated during network administration of the printers if a network management tool is utilized which continuously polls for the presence of the printers and which obtains configuration and capability information from the printers. Such large amounts of network traffic can detract from the other communication between workstations, servers, and other network devices. Furthermore, a large number of printers in a network environment can consume a large number of corresponding IP addresses which may limit the total number of IP addresses available on the network for other devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Other considerations in conventional network environments include user policy and security problems. For example, a network user is able to see the presence of a printer at the user&apos;s workstation, but may not have authorization to access the print queue associated with the printer. Such a user may then use the IP address of the printer to send a rendered print job directly to the printer without going through the print queue. Such an action would be in violation of user policy and could be a security breach if a sensitive document is printed to a printer at an unsecured location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Network management tools, such as administration software and stand-alone appliances, have been developed in an attempt to make the network administration of printers more efficient for a network administrator. However, such network management tools often require that the network printers have special software to simulate a plug-and-play functionality for detection and configuration of the printers. For example, the network printers may require special software to initiate a discovery process and publish information about itself to the network. In addition, many such network management tools require frequent issuance of broadcast messages or status messages to all printers on the network to detect new printers and/or monitor for changes in existing printers. As mentioned above, this additional network traffic is undesirable and can cause network congestion. In the case that a plurality of network management tools are utilized in a large network environment to handle all printers in a distributed fashion, the network administrator does not have a single focal point from which to efficiently manage all printers. Lastly, known network management tools are not believed to be extendable to provide additional printer support functionality as needed in accordance with a particular network environment. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The present invention addresses the foregoing problems by providing a management tool for managing a plurality of network devices, such as network printers, copiers and other devices, on a network in an efficient fashion. In particular, the initial network configuration of a network device is automatically managed by the present invention because the presence of each new network device on the network is automatically detected. Upon the detection of a new network device, discovery is conducted to obtain configuration information and capabilities information regarding the detected network device. Upon completion of such discovery, the present invention enables the functional support for the network device, such as creation and management of a print queue corresponding to a printing device, and other functional support for the network device. In addition, the network management device of the present invention allows for a plurality of network devices to be connected to the network management device over a local network, while only the network management device is connected to the main network, thereby isolating the network devices from all other devices on the main network and requiring the other devices on the main network to go through the network management device to access the functional services and capabilities of the plurality of network devices. Lastly, the network management device of the present invention provides support for a user interface for network administration of all network devices being managed by the network management device, and by all other network management devices on the main network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, one aspect of the invention concerns managing a plurality of network devices on a network, including detecting an address assignment message sent from an address server over the network to a network device, the address assignment message containing an assigned address corresponding to the network device, sending an information request message, in response to the detection of the address assignment message, over the network from the network management device to the network device, the information request message containing the assigned address corresponding to the network device, receiving information, in response to the information request message, from the network device, and creating an entry corresponding to the network device in a device management directory, the entry containing the assigned address corresponding to the network device and the information received from the network device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the network device is a network printer, although other network devices are supported by the invention. In addition, the network management device utilizes the initial DHCP address request from the network device to initiate discovery of the network device. Furthermore, a predetermined set of MAC address ranges can be set to limit the network devices that are processed for discovery by the present invention. In this manner, a network administrator can limit the present invention to discover only network devices of a certain type. The present invention also preferably allows for a plurality of such network management devices for distribution across a large, complex network in order to detect and manage all network devices throughout the network. In such an embodiment, the plurality of network devices managed by each network management device are preferably connected to each respective network management device by a local network and are not visible to all other servers, workstations and other devices on the main network. In addition, in a multiple network management device environment, the detection and management of all network devices on the network is performed in a coordinated fashion between the multiple network management devices to avoid unnecessary redundancy and network confusion, and to balance the functional support for all network devices among the multiple network management devices based on resource availability and location of each network management device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect, the invention is directed to managing a plurality of network printers on a network with a network management device in which an address request message is received from one of the plurality of network printers, the address request message containing a MAC address corresponding to the network printer. An address assignment message is sent from an address server in the network management device over the network to the network printer, the address assignment message containing the MAC address and an assigned IP address corresponding to the network printer, and a discovery module in the network management device is notified of the assigned IP address of the network printer. It is determined, in the discovery module, if the MAC address of the network printer is within a predetermined range of MAC addresses. In the case that the MAC address of the network printer is within the predetermined range of MAC addresses, an information request message is sent from the discovery module over the network to the network printer, the information request message containing the assigned IP address corresponding to the network printer. Information from the network printer is received in response to the information request message, in the case that the MAC address of the network printer is within the predetermined range of MAC addresses. An entry is created corresponding to the network printer in a device management directory, in the case that the MAC address of the network printer is within a predetermined range of MAC addresses, wherein the entry contains the MAC address and the assigned IP address corresponding to the network printer, and contains the information received from the network printer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the address request message is a DHCP address request. The present invention also preferably allows for a plurality of such network management devices for distribution across a large, complex network in order to detect and manage all network printers throughout the network. In such an embodiment, the set of network printers managed by each network management device are preferably connected to the respective network management device by a local network and are not visible to all other servers, workstations and other devices on the main network. In addition, in a multiple network management device environment, the detection and management of all network printers on the network is performed in a coordinated fashion between the multiple network management devices to avoid unnecessary redundancy and network confusion, and to balance the functional support for all network printers among the multiple network management devices based on resource availability and location of each network management device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> By virtue of the foregoing, efficient management of a large number of network devices, such as network printers and other devices, across a network can be provided so that the initialization and network configuration of network devices across a network is automatically managed, thereby greatly reducing the effort required by a network administrator. In addition, the plurality of network devices can be physically isolated from a main network by use of the present invention such that undesirable network traffic associated with the network devices is removed from the main network and such that network users cannot access or use the network devices without going through an associated network management device, thereby preventing security and network policy problems. Furthermore, multiple network management devices can be used to manage all network devices across a network to provide a single focal point user interface for a network administrator to manage all of the network devices. Lastly, the isolation of the network devices from the main network through the use of the present invention can allow the network devices to use local IP addresses on local networks corresponding to each of the network management devices, thereby saving valuable IP addresses for use by other devices on the main network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> This brief summary has been provided so that the nature of the invention may be understood quickly. A more complete understanding of the invention can be obtained by reference to the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment thereof in connection with the attached drawings.</paragraph>

For example, printing capabilities <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> can include, but is not limited to, color printing capabilities, recording sheet-size capability such as letter and/or A<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and resolution capabilities. Server <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is the identity of the network management device which is maintaining the print queue for a given printing device. For example, in a network environment having multiple network management devices, different print queues may be distributed among the multiple network management devices in order to balance the processing throughput and memory load required to maintain the print queues. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a block diagram for explaining the functionality of network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the network environment of network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, DHCP server <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> is provided in network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for supporting DHCP communications over network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> using the DHCP protocol. In particular, DHCP server <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> can be enabled, such as by a system administrator through front panel <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, to respond to all DHCP address requests on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for an IP address. In this configuration, DHCP server <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> supports a software hook to which discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> has preregistered. When DHCP server <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> receives a DHCP address request from a device on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, DHCP server <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> responds to the requesting device with an assigned IP address. When DHCP server <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> receives an address acknowledgment message from the requesting device, DHCP server <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> uses the software hook to notify discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> of the assignment of an IP address to the requesting device. Discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> can then determine if the requesting device is the type of network device that discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> should perform discovery on, and if so, discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> sends a discovery request message to the device to obtain information regarding the device&apos;s network settings, as well as device capabilities and configuration. A predetermined range of MAC addresses can be used by discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> to determine whether a device detected by DHCP server <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> is one for which discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> should perform discovery. In addition, a predetermined MAC address range may also be used by DHCP server <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> so that DHCP server <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> will only provide assigned IP addresses to a preferred set of network devices, such as network printers. Preferably, discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> compares the MAC address of the address acknowledgment message to the predetermined MAC address range to determine if the device is a network printer that should be discovered and managed by network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In the alternative, network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can also be configured to disable DHCP server <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>, such as by a system administrator either through front panel <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> or through network configuration web page <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. For example, when an external DHCP module is used DHCP server <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> is disabled to prevent addressing conflicts and discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> conducts classic discovery to discover all printing devices on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Such classic discovery of the printing devices can include, but is not limited to, known techniques such as using broadcast discovery messages, pinging through a list of IP addresses, router table walking, and DNS lookup. For example, an SNMP broadcast discovery message can be sent and then discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> can send a targeted SNMP discovery request to each responding printing device. In the alternative, discovery module can ping through a list of IP addresses and then send a targeted SNMP discovery request to each responding printing device. As another alternative, discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> can obtain router tables from the routers on the network and then send an SNMP discovery request to each printing device having an IP address in the routing tables. Lastly, discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> can obtain a list of assigned IP addresses from a DNS server on the network and then send an SNMP discovery request to each printing device having an IP address in the list. It can be appreciated that other known methods of discovery can be used by discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> to discover printing devices on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> when an external DHCP server is used instead of DHCP server <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> in network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In addition to classic discovery methods, DHCP listening module <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> can be used to detect an IP address acknowledgment message for a new requesting printing device on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In particular, DHCP listening module <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> detects DHCP address acknowledgment messages which contain an IP address for a new printing device on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. For example, after boot-up of network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the configuration where an external DHCP server is utilized, discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> uses classic discovery methods as discussed above to discover the printing devices existing on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> After using such classic discovery, DHCP listening module <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> can then be used to detect printing devices which subsequently become operational on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by detecting the IP address acknowledgment message sent from the DHCP server to the newly incorporated printing device to the external DHCP server. In this manner, DHCP listening module <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> can be used to augment classic discovery in order to supplement the list of discovered printing devices after initial boot-up of network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. DHCP listening module <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> also uses a software hook, to which discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> has preregistered, to notify discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> when a newly incorporated printing device has been detected. Discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> then initiates a discovery process for obtaining information from the newly incorporated printing device, as discussed in more detail below. DHCP listening module <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> can also use a MAC address range in order to listen only for IP address acknowledgment messages corresponding to a particular class of network devices, such as network printers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, when an external DHCP server is used, discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> uses classic discovery methods to discover printing devices on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, after which DHCP listening module <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> can be used to discover subsequently incorporated printing devices. On the other hand, when DHCP server <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> is utilized, discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is notified through the software hook from DHCP server <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> of a detected printing device. Regardless of the manner in which discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> becomes aware of a detected printing device, discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> initiates discovery of information from the printing device. Preferably, discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> sends an SNMP information request to the detected printing device by using the IP address of the detected printing device. The detected printing device then responds with an SNMP information message to provide the requested information to discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. Discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> creates an entry for each discovered printing device in device management directory <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. As discussed above, the entry corresponding to each discovered device in device management directory <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> includes the IP address, MAC address, printing device type and network configuration information corresponding to printer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> also notifies print queue service module <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> of each discovered printing device so that print queue service module <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> can create a new print queue for the printing device and place the new print queue in print queues <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. Print queue service module <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> also creates an entry in print queue configuration directory <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> which contains identification information for the printer, such as IP address, MAC address and printing device type, as well as a print queue name and printing device capabilities. In this manner, the network configuration of printing devices is easily managed and print queues are efficiently created and maintained for the detected printing devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Although the block diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows that network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is only using one of network interfaces <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> for connecting to network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, another configuration is supported by network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in which one of the network interfaces is used to connect to another network, such as a local network on which only printing devices reside. In such an environment, DHCP server <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> can be configured to respond only to IP address requests from printing devices on the second local network, thereby leaving DHCP server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of server <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to respond to all other IP address requests on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In this manner, printing devices can be physically isolated from all other network devices on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to prevent unauthorized use and managed use of the printing devices connected to the second local network through network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The functionality of this embodiment is discussed in more detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> As also seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, web server <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> allows web pages such as those described with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, to be published over the network to network users, such as a user at workstation <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or a network administrator at server <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Lastly, function application modules <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> can provide network-wide functional capabilities for the printing devices managed by network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and interface with virtual device containers <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> for supporting such network applications on behalf of printing devices managed by network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. For example, functional application modules <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> may include a secure printing application which allows users on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to provide print jobs to printing devices managed by network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in a secure fashion. Even though the printing devices do not have the embedded functionality for supporting secure printing, virtual device containers <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> act on behalf of their respective printing devices to support such functionality. In this manner, network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is an extendable management tool for efficiently managing printing devices on a network whereby additional functionality can be added depending on the needs of the particular network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In addition, network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can control a network device which it manages, such as a network printer, so as to reconfigure the network device for efficient operation under the management of network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. For example, if a network printer is connected to network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> over the local network, then network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can use SNMP messages to reconfigure the network printer. Such reconfiguration of the network printer can include, but is not limited to, instructions for the network printer to stop supporting certain protocols and to only use the protocol which network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> uses to communicate with the network printer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> provides a block diagram for explaining the contents of functional application modules <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. As previously discussed above, functional application modules <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> are used to operate in conjunction with virtual device modules <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> to support additional functional capabilities for the printing devices managed by network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In this manner, a legacy printing device which does not support a new network application, such as secure printing, can appear to other devices on the network as if it supports the new application. Turning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, functional application modules <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> includes print job accounting application module <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> for tracking print jobs directed to printing devices managed by network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, maintaining accounting information related to the print jobs, where the information may be sorted by network user, and exporting the information for use by a print job accounting client. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Functional application modules <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> also includes print job policy management application module <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> which can be used to control access to, and allowed functionality, for each printing device managed by the network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. This control can preferably be modified by settings provided by the system administrator. Printing device management application module <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is used to provide and support a user interface, such as a user interface on workstations <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or server <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, for a user such as a system administrator to access and manage the network configuration of the network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the printing devices managed by network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, such as those having entries in device management directory <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. Printing device driver utility <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> maintains an appropriate print driver for each of the printing devices managed by network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Preferably, a network user can access and download the print drivers from printing device driver utility <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, such as using print queue web page <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight>. In addition, printing device driver utility <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> preferably obtains the appropriate print drivers over the internet, such as from web pages of manufacturers for the corresponding printing devices. For example, printing device driver utility <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> can use a separate, generic internet download module to obtain such print drivers. Secure print job application module <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> is a module for supporting the secure submission of print jobs for a printing device managed by network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and for authorizing the secure printing of the print job to the printing device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Turning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, services directories <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is seen to include local services directory <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and global services directory <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. In general, services directories <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> are useful in a network environment where there are many network devices, such as network printers, to manage. In such an environment, it is preferable to have multiple network management devices across the network enterprise. The multiple network management devices preferably act in a coordinated fashion for fault tolerance and load sharing, so as to determine which network management device will support a particular functional service. For example, only one of the multiple network management devices on a given subnet should have the responsibility of detecting and discovering network devices on the subnet to avoid confusion regarding assignment of IP addresses and the like. In addition, load balancing considerations may suggest that it is desirable to have one or more of the other multiple network management devices perform other functional services for the printing devices on the subnet, such as print queue creation and management. Accordingly, it is preferable to use service directories to allow each network management device, and the functional services which they execute, to find which one of the multiple network management devices maintains and executes a particular functional service. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Generally, local services directory <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> contains an entry for each functional service maintained by a particular network management device for a subnet. An example of such a local functional service is the discovery service for that subnet. Global services directory <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> contains an entry for each functional service that is global in nature. For example, global services directory <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> can recognize the existence of each network management device and includes entries for a global information service for obtaining information of all network devices managed by all network management modules across the network, and a load balance service for balancing services across all network management modules across the network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, both local services directory <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and global services directory <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> have a similar format, although other formats are possible. The format consists of multiple entries organized by the fields of subnet id <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, service <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, and network management device id <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>. Local services directory <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> supports identification of the services supported by one or more network management devices on a particular network segment such as a subnet. It should be appreciated that <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> represents just one example of a format for services directories <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and that other formats are possible. For instance, the subnet id may comprise the actual subnet address and mask instead of a representative number. In addition, the identifier under the service field may be a universally unique identifier for uniquely identifying each particular service instead of using a general description. Lastly, the nmd id for each network management device may be the actual address of the network management device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, local services directory <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> corresponds to a network segment named subnet <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, as reflected by the subnet values therein. In addition, the entries in local services directory <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> indicate that discovery services for subnet <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are provided by a network management device having a nmd id of <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and that print queue services for subnet <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are provided by a network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> having a nmd id of <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In this manner, two network management devices on subnet <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> share the responsibilities of providing the necessary services for the printing devices in that subnet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> In a similar fashion, it can be seen that global services directory <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> indicates globally supported services and the respective network management devices that provide such services. Global services directory <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> reflects the services that are accessible to all network management devices across all network segments (subnets) in a large, complex network. For example, it can be seen from global services directory <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> that the print queue for subnet <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is performed by nmd <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, that the discovery service manager resides on nmd <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and that the global information service resides on nmd <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In this manner the services provided by multiple network management devices in a large network environment are published in a distributed fashion between local and a global levels. The use and functionality of local services directory <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and global services directory <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> is discussed further below with respect to network environments having multiple network management devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is a block diagram for explaining an extended version of global services directory <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and is similar to the version depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, with certain exceptions. First, the global services directory <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> describes additional services for each subnet. As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, global services directory <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> also includes an entry for subnet <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to indicate that the master device for subnet <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is network management device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In addition, an entry is provided to indicate that the discovery service manager is maintained by network management device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. An entry is also provided to indicate that the global information service is maintained by network management device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Lastly, an entry is provided to indicate that the print queue service manager is supported by network management device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. In this manner, all global functional capabilities are easily accessed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</cross-reference> provides a flowchart for explaining the process of detecting printing devices on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> when network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is configured to use internal DHCP server <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> to assign IP addresses on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In step S<highlight><bold>1301</bold></highlight>, the processing for detecting printing devices on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> begins. In step S<highlight><bold>1302</bold></highlight>, it is determined if start-up of discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> has just been initiated. If so, flow passes to step S<highlight><bold>1303</bold></highlight> in which internal DHCP server <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> passes to discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, through a software hook, a list of printing devices for which DHCP server has already assigned IP addresses since the boot-up of network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In this manner, discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> does not miss any printing devices which may obtain IP addresses from DHCP server <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> in the early moments after start-up of network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Flow then passes to step S<highlight><bold>1304</bold></highlight>. If start-up of discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> has not just occurred, then flow passes to step S<highlight><bold>1304</bold></highlight> in which a printing device on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> sends a DHCP discover request message for an IP address, wherein the DHCP discover request message contains the MAC address of the requesting printing device. Internal DHCP server <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>, being the active DHCP server on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, responds to the request by sending an DHCP address assignment message containing an IP address to the requesting printing device (step S<highlight><bold>1305</bold></highlight>). The printing device then sends a DHCP address request message to DHCP server <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> to request that the received IP address be registered for the printing device, after which DHCP server <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> responds with an IP address acknowledgment message to the printing device (step S<highlight><bold>1306</bold></highlight>). In step S<highlight><bold>1307</bold></highlight>, DHCP server <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> calls a software hook, to which discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> has previously registered, to notify discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> of the printing device which has just acknowledge an assigned IP address. The MAC address and the assigned IP address are provided to discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> through the hook. Flow then passes to return in step S<highlight><bold>1308</bold></highlight>. In this manner, internal DHCP server <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> is utilized to inform discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> of detected printing devices on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> when DHCP server <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> is acting as the only DHCP server on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</cross-reference> provides a flowchart for explaining the process of detecting printing devices on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> when network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is configured to disable internal DHCP server <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> and an external DHCP server is used to assign IP addresses on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In this mode, DHCP server <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> is not active and therefore cannot be used to inform discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> of detected printing devices on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, as discussed above with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, classic discovery mechanisms are used to perform initial discovery of existing printing devices on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, after which DHCP listening module <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is used to efficiently detect printing devices which are subsequently incorporated onto network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In step S<highlight><bold>1310</bold></highlight>, processing begins for detecting printing devices on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In step S<highlight><bold>1311</bold></highlight>, it is determined if start-up of discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> has just been initiated. If so, flow passes to step S<highlight><bold>1312</bold></highlight> in which discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> uses a classic discovery mechanism, such as broadcasting, pinging, router table walking, and DNS look-up, as discussed with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. Whichever discovery mechanism is used, discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> receives responses from printing devices on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which confirms the existence and identity of each printing device (step S<highlight><bold>1313</bold></highlight>) after which flow passes to step S<highlight><bold>1314</bold></highlight>. In this manner, classic discovery mechanisms are used at boot-up of network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to detect printing devices on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which have already obtained an IP address from an external DHCP server. If it is determined in step S<highlight><bold>1311</bold></highlight> that start-up of discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> has not just been initiated, flow passes to step S<highlight><bold>1314</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Once classic discovery is used to detect all existing printing devices on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, DHCP listening module <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> can be used to efficiently detect any printing devices which are subsequently incorporated into network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. DHCP listening module <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> detects these printing devices by sniffing the traffic on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for any DHCP address acknowledgment message which indicates that a device has just received an IP address. In step S<highlight><bold>1314</bold></highlight>, a newly incorporated printing device on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, such as one that has just been brought online, sends a DHCP address discover message for an IP address, wherein the request includes the MAC address of the requesting printing device. In step S<highlight><bold>1315</bold></highlight>, the external DHCP server sends a DHCP address assignment message with an IP address to the requesting printing device. The requesting printing device then sends a DHCP request message to the external DHCP server to request registration of the assigned IP address for the printing device, after which the external DHCP server sends a DHCP address acknowledgment message to the printing device (step S<highlight><bold>1316</bold></highlight>). DHCP listening module <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> detects the presence of the DHCP address acknowledgment message on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in step S<highlight><bold>1317</bold></highlight>. DHCP listening module then uses a software hook, similar to that previously discussed with respect to DHCP server <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>, to notify discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> of the printing device corresponding to the detected DHCP address acknowledgment message (step S<highlight><bold>1318</bold></highlight>). The hook preferably provides discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> with the MAC address and IP address of the detected printing device. In addition, discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> preferably preregisters with DHCP listening module <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> to use the software hook. Flow then passes to return in step S<highlight><bold>1319</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13C</cross-reference> provides the functionality of network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> once printing devices have been detected, regardless of whether an internal or external DHCP server is used to assign IP addresses to devices on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In the example depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>C, SNMP is used to communicate between network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and printing devices on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to conduct discovery. It should be appreciated that other known protocols and mechanisms can be used to obtain information regarding the network settings, configuration and functional capabilities of each printing device. In step S<highlight><bold>1320</bold></highlight>, discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> sends an SNMP information request message over network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the printing device, such as printer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, corresponding to the IP address contained in the detected DHCP IP address assignment message (step S<highlight><bold>1320</bold></highlight>). Next, in step S<highlight><bold>1321</bold></highlight>, discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> receives from printer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> (the detected printing device in this example) an SNMP information response message in response to the SNMP information request message. The SNMP information response message contains information corresponding to printer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> such as the MAC address, IP address, printing device type, and other network configuration information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>1322</bold></highlight>, discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> creates an entry in device management directory <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> for printer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the detected printing device. The entry includes the MAC address, IP address, printing device type, and other network configuration information received from printer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in the SNMP information response message. In this manner, printing devices on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are detected and discovered by network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> based on the conventional IP address request issued by network devices at initialization. Accordingly, no special software or hardware is required on the part of the printing devices to support the automatic detection and discovery function of the network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Next, the execution of any necessary or desired ones of virtual device modules <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and functional application modules <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is initiated, thereby providing additional functional capabilities for the detected and discovered printing device (step S<highlight><bold>1323</bold></highlight>). Print queue service module <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> is also notified for creation of a print queue for the detected printing device, thereby placing the print queue in print queues <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and creating an entry in print queue configuration directory (step S<highlight><bold>1324</bold></highlight>). The network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is published to network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in step S<highlight><bold>1308</bold></highlight> as a print server with modified print queues <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> containing the new print queue corresponding to the detected printing device (step S<highlight><bold>1325</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Once a printing device has been discovered and network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has been configured properly to manage requests for services from the printing device, network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is capable of handling such requests for services. In step S<highlight><bold>1326</bold></highlight>, it is determined if network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has received a print job from one of the network devices on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, such as workstation <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which is directed to a printing device having a corresponding print queue in print queues <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. If so, the print job is directed to the appropriate one of print queues <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> in step S<highlight><bold>1327</bold></highlight>. The print job is then eventually sent from the print queue to the corresponding printer device in accordance with the rules and policy of the print queue (step <highlight><bold>1328</bold></highlight>). If it is determined in step S<highlight><bold>1326</bold></highlight> that a print job has not been received, flow passes directly to step S<highlight><bold>1329</bold></highlight>. In step S<highlight><bold>1329</bold></highlight>, it is determined if a request has been received from a network user for network configuration web page <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> for access and management of network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and of all printing devices managed by network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. If a request has been received, network configuration web page <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is updated based on the entries in device management directory <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and sent to the workstation of the network user, such as a system administrator (step S<highlight><bold>1330</bold></highlight>). Network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> then responds to any management commands provided by the network user through network configuration web page <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> (step S<highlight><bold>1331</bold></highlight>). Flow then passes to return in step S<highlight><bold>1332</bold></highlight>. If it is determined in step S<highlight><bold>1329</bold></highlight> that a request for network configuration web page <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> has not been received, flow passes directly to return in step S<highlight><bold>1332</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> is a block diagram for explaining a network environment in which two network management devices are connected to the network. As discussed above with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the network environment includes network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, workstations <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, laptop <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, server <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, printers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In addition, second network management device <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is also connected to network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Both network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and second network management device <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> generally operate as described above with respect to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. In such a network environment as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> both network management devices must acknowledge each other&apos;s presence on the network in order to avoid confusion and redundancy with respect to discovery and management of printing devices on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In this regard, each network management device can discover the presence of the other network management device by one of two ways. First, a network administrator may manually enter the IP address of the other network management device on the front panel of each network management device or via a user interface on a workstation. In the alternative, each network management device sends out an announcement message on a periodic basis to publish its presence on the network to other network devices. Preferably, the announcement message is a multicast message which contains the name of the network management device, and the IP address, MAC address, version, service manager status, directory status, number of discovered devices for the network management device. The multicast message can also include the time that the network management device has been in service and a resource availability indicator for the network management device. One of network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and network management device <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> can then be designated as a master device and the other designated as a slave device. The master device can then determine, based on a set of policies and rules, which of the two network management devices should support certain services for the printing devices in network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. For example, network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be designated as the master device and may determine that network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> should only perform discovery services for network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and that network management device <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> should only perform print queue services for network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In this manner, the discovery and management of the printing devices on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is efficiently distributed between the two network management devices and network confusion and redundancy is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> depicts a network embodiment similar to that of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, except that the printing devices are isolated from network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by being separated into two groups, each of which is connected to the second network port of each respective network management device. As discussed above, network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has network interface <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and network interface <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> so that network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be connected to two separate networks at once. Accordingly, each group of printers in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> is connected by an isolated local network to the second network port of a respective network management device. In this example, the DHCP server of each network management device must actively respond to the IP address requests of the printing devices on the local network of the respective network management device, because the printers are not visible to network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The DHCP server of each network management device can use local IP addresses for the printers on its local network, thereby saving valuable IP addresses for use on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In the network environment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, users on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are prevented from accessing the printers directly and must go through the respective network management device to use them. Network security and policy problems can thereby be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Each of the network management devices in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> operate as described above with respect to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. In addition, the master/slave designations described above with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> are only relevant to the network management devices in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> for purposes of discovery and print queue management on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. With respect to the local network of each network management device, the respective network management device is the only device visible to the group of printers on the local network and therefore supports both discovery and print queue management services for the local network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, if a network user of workstation <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> submits a print job for one of the printers, such as printer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the print job is directed to the print server of network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The print job is then placed in the appropriate print queue maintained by network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and then passed from the print queue to the corresponding printer on the local network of network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> depicts a network environment similar to that of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> except that both network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and network management device <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are connected to a single local network via their second network interface ports, and all printers reside on the single local network. Accordingly, the master/slave relationship between the two network management devices for managing the services for network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is also used for managing the services for the single shared local network on which the printers reside. It can be appreciated that the allocation of services between the two network management devices for network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be different than the allocation of services between the two network management devices for the shared local network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> In this regard, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> provides a block diagram for explaining the master/slave relationship of multiple network management devices in a distributed network environment, and the allocation of services for each network segment (subnet) in the network environment. Turning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, it can be seen that the distributed network environment is comprised of network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (subnet <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), which is the enterprise backbone on which network management devices <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (nmd <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> (nmd <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> (nmd <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) reside. The network environment also includes subnet <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> which is a shared local network between network management devices <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>, and subnet <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> which is a local network of network management devices <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. Subnet <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is a physically removed network segment which represents a satellite office network which is connected to network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by a router. Network management devices <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> (nmd <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> (nmd <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) reside on subnet <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and network management device <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> is connected by its second network interface to subnet <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> It can be appreciated from a review of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> that some of the network management devices are connected via their first network interface to a subnet which is shared with other network management devices, some of the network management devices are connected via their second network interface to a subnet which is shared with other network management devices, and some of the network management devices are connected via their second network interface to a subnet which is not shared with any other network management device. Accordingly, the services for each of the subnets that a particular network management device is connected to are allocated in a different fashion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> For example, it can be seen that the services for subnet <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are distributed such that network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is the discovery manager (service A manager) and network management device <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> is the print queue service manager (service B manager). In addition, network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> maintains a local services directory for subnet <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as described above with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. A backup copy of the local services directory is also maintained by network management device <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> for fault recovery in the event of failure of network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. It can also be seen that network management device <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> has been designated as the master device for subnet <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and can reallocate the distribution of services for subnet <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> based on changes in subnet <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or in allocation policy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Network management device <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> is the only network management device for subnet <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and therefore is the service manager for all services on subnet <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, maintains the local services directory for subnet <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and is the master device for subnet <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Subnet <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) has three network management devices residing on it, however it can be seen that network management device <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> does not have any direct responsibility for subnet <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, but does maintain the global services directory for the entire network environment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. Network management device <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> obtains copies of the local service directory information for all other subnets to maintain the global services directory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is the master device for subnet <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and also maintains the local services directory for subnet <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Network management device <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> is tasked with managing both discovery and print queue services for subnet <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Network management device <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> acts as the sole network management device for subnet <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and therefore manages both discovery and print queue services for subnet <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, maintains the local services directory for subnet <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and is the master device for subnet <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Network management device <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> also maintains a backup global services directory in the event that network management device <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> experiences a failure. Similar to network management device <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>, network management device <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> is the sole network management device for subnet <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and therefore manages both discovery and print queue services for subnet <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, maintains the local services directory for subnet <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and is the master device for subnet <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> It can be appreciated that the local services directory for each subnet is an efficient means for each network management device on the subnet to find out which network management device supports a particular service for the subnet. Similarly, the global services directory provides an efficient means for all network management devices on the subnet to find out which network management device supports a particular service for a particular subnet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> provides a block diagram in tabular form for showing the services and directories allocations discussed above with respect to the network management devices shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. The states of the services and directories for each subnet to which each network management device is connected are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> is a block diagram for explaining the functionality of print queue service manager <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> for allocating the balance between network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and network management device <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> for supporting print queue services. As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>, print queue service manager <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> is comprised of policy agent <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, load balancer <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> and data collector <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>. Policy agent <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> obtains policy rules for allocation of print queue services from global policy agent <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> which is preferably accessed from a network management device which maintains a global services directory. Load balancer <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> detects external event <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, such as the addition of a new printer on the network, and consults policy agent <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> to determine if a reallocation of print queue services is necessary. This determination is also based on input to load balancer <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> from data collector <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> which collects statistics regarding the services performed in each of network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and network management device <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, such as from discovery modules <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>, and print queue service modules <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Performance monitors <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> of network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and network management device <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, respectively, monitor performance of the aforementioned discovery modules and print queue service modules. The performance monitors are accessed and controlled by load balancer <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>. In response to external event <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, the monitored performance of the network management device services, past service statistics, and policy agent <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, load balancer <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> determines whether to reallocate the print queue services between network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and network management device <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. If a reallocation is necessary, load balancer <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> instructs the discovery modules and print queue service modules of the network management devices accordingly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> is a flowchart for explaining the initialization boot-up procedure for network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> according to the present invention. In step S<highlight><bold>2001</bold></highlight>, the boot-up process begins at power-up of network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> or in response to a user command. Next, flow passes to step S<highlight><bold>2002</bold></highlight> in which a series of steps begin for each of the two network ports of network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In step S<highlight><bold>2003</bold></highlight> it is determined whether the current network is enabled, such that network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is connected to a network segment (subnet) on that network port. If it is determined in step S<highlight><bold>2003</bold></highlight> that the current network is not enabled flow returns to step S<highlight><bold>2002</bold></highlight> for checking the next network port, if any others remain. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Otherwise, if the current network is enabled, flow passes to step S<highlight><bold>2004</bold></highlight> in which a multicast announcement is sent by network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> over the current network to discover other network management devices on the current network. Next, a multicast query for a global services directory is sent over the current network (step S<highlight><bold>2005</bold></highlight>). In step S<highlight><bold>2006</bold></highlight>, it is determined if a global services directory (GSD) was found, and if so, flow passes to step S<highlight><bold>2007</bold></highlight> in which a GSD flag is set to &ldquo;ON&rdquo;, after which flow passes to step S<highlight><bold>2008</bold></highlight>. If it was determined in step S<highlight><bold>2006</bold></highlight> that a global services directory (GSD) was not found, flow passes directly to step S<highlight><bold>2008</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>2008</bold></highlight>, a multicast query is sent over the current network for a local services network. In step S<highlight><bold>2009</bold></highlight>, it is determined if a local services network was found. If not, flow passes to step S<highlight><bold>2010</bold></highlight> in which a local services directory is created, and then flow passes to step S<highlight><bold>2011</bold></highlight>. If a local services directory was found in step S<highlight><bold>2009</bold></highlight>, flow passes directly to step S<highlight><bold>2011</bold></highlight>. In step S<highlight><bold>2011</bold></highlight>, the services supported by network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are added to the local services directory. Next, in step S<highlight><bold>2012</bold></highlight>, it is noted how many services are registered in the local services directory for network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In step S<highlight><bold>2013</bold></highlight> it is determined whether all network ports of network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> have been cycled through. If not, flow passes to step S<highlight><bold>2003</bold></highlight> where the next network port is processed as in steps S<highlight><bold>2002</bold></highlight> through S<highlight><bold>2012</bold></highlight>. If all network ports have been processed, flow passes to step S<highlight><bold>2014</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>2014</bold></highlight>, it is determined whether there was a global services directory found on any of the network ports by checking the GSD flag. If a global services directory was not found, a global services directory is created on whichever one of the two networks of network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has the most services (step S<highlight><bold>2015</bold></highlight>). It can be appreciated that other criteria can also be used to decide which subnet should have the global services directory. For example, the level of removal (number of subnet hops) from the other network management devices across the network can be a deciding factor. If a global services directory was found, the existence of network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, as well as any global services performed by network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, are entered into global services directory (step S<highlight><bold>2016</bold></highlight>). The processing for determining the master device is then initiated in parallel at step S<highlight><bold>2017</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, flow continues at step S<highlight><bold>2018</bold></highlight> in which a multicast announcement is sent through all network ports of network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. It is determined in step S<highlight><bold>2019</bold></highlight> if a discovery request has been received, and, if so, flow returns to step S<highlight><bold>2018</bold></highlight>. If not, flow passes to step S<highlight><bold>2020</bold></highlight> in which it is determined if network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> should shutdown. If so, flow passes to step S<highlight><bold>2021</bold></highlight> in which network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> proceeds with shutdown. Otherwise, flow proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>2022</bold></highlight> in which a wait state is engaged, after which flow returns to step S<highlight><bold>2018</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> provides a flowchart for explaining how a master device is determined according to the present invention, beginning at step S<highlight><bold>2017</bold></highlight>. In step S<highlight><bold>2101</bold></highlight>, processing starts for a specific one of the enabled networks of network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>.
