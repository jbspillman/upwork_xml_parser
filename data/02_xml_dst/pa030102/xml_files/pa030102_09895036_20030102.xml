<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to semiconductor manufacturing, and is more particularly concerned with processing chambers in which semiconductor manufacturing processes are performed. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Semiconductor manufacturing typically involves applying a number of processes to a substrate such as a silicon wafer. The processes applied may include depositing a thin film of a metal or other substance on the wafer by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or physical vapor deposition (PVD). Other processes include etching, annealing, photolithography, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Semiconductor manufacturing processes are generally performed under controlled conditions such as high vacuum in dedicated processing chambers. It is necessary to load a wafer into a processing chamber prior to processing and then to remove the wafer from the chamber after processing. In connection with such operations, a typical chamber has a number of moving parts that aid in loading and unloading the wafer. For example, in a conventional CVD chamber, a heated pedestal is provided to support the wafer during deposition processing. Conventionally, the pedestal is movable in a vertical direction. In a conventional sequence of events, the pedestal is in a lowered position while a robot blade enters the CVD chamber with a wafer. Substrate lifters are raised above the surface of the pedestal to lift the wafer from the robot blade. The robot blade retracts and the substrate lifters are then lowered to place the wafer on the pedestal. Then the pedestal is raised to bring the wafer to a processing position near the top of the processing chamber. During deposition processing, process gas is emitted from the top of the processing chamber via a &ldquo;showerhead&rdquo;. The sequence is repeated in reverse to unload the wafer from the CVD chamber after processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It would be desirable to reduce the manufacturing cost of semiconductor processing chambers by reducing the number of moving parts employed therein. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> According to a first aspect of the invention a processing chamber adapted to process a substrate is provided. The chamber includes a chamber body which defines a chamber enclosure, and a pedestal mounted in the chamber enclosure and adapted to support the substrate during processing. Also included in the processing chamber are an edge ring (e.g., a shadow ring or purge ring) adapted to shield an edge of the substrate during processing, and a lift mechanism adapted to selectively raise and lower the edge ring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The processing chamber may further include a pumping ring adapted to cover an exhaust channel in the enclosure, with the lift mechanism adapted to raise the pumping ring with the edge ring. The processing chamber may further include a substrate lifter (e.g., a lift pin or a lift hoop) adapted to lift the substrate from the pedestal, with the same lift mechanism being adapted to raise the substrate lifter simultaneously with the edge ring and/or the pumping ring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The lift mechanism may have a first range of movement in which the lift mechanism raises the edge ring and/or the pumping ring without raising the substrate lifter, and a second range of movement in which the lift mechanism simultaneously raises both the substrate lifter and the edge ring and/or pumping ring. The lift mechanism may include a lift plate adapted to actuate the substrate lifter, and an extension extending upwardly from the lift plate and adapted to contact and raise the edge ring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> With a semiconductor processing chamber provided in accordance with the invention, it is possible to avoid the expense of providing a lift mechanism for the pedestal on which a wafer is held during processing. Furthermore, by using a single lift mechanism both to actuate a substrate lifter and to lift an edge ring and/or a pumping ring, the number of moving parts and the cost of the processing chamber are further reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided an actuator assembly adapted to be installed on a substrate processing chamber. The actuator assembly includes an assembly housing adapted to be mounted to an underside of the substrate processing chamber. Also included in the actuator assembly is an actuator housing mounted outside a lower end of the assembly housing, the actuator having a plunger that extends upwardly from the actuator into the assembly housing. The actuator assembly further includes a bellows having a first flange at a first end of the bellows and attached to the plunger and having a second flange at a second end of the bellows and attached to the actuator housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The actuator assembly provided in accordance with this aspect of the invention may be conveniently assembled prior to installation on the processing chamber, and helps to assure that the actuator plunger is properly aligned relative to the processing chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Other objects, features and advantages of the invention will become more fully apparent from the following detailed description of the exemplary embodiments, the appended claims and the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the invention, a CVD chamber includes a stationary wafer support pedestal. An edge ring rests on the pedestal and protects the edge of a wafer during CVD processing. The edge ring is lifted up from the pedestal when processing is completed to allow exchange of wafers. The same lift mechanism that lifts the edge ring is also employed to actuate a substrate lifter and to lift a pumping ring out of the path of a robot blade. In a first range of movement of the lift mechanism, the edge ring and the pumping ring are lifted but the substrate lifter is not lifted. In a second range of movement above the first range of movement, the lift mechanism simultaneously lifts the edge ring, the pumping ring and the substrate lifter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> A CVD chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> provided in accordance with an aspect of the invention that has a stationary wafer-support pedestal <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, will now be described with reference to the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a side cross-sectional view of the CVD chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, showing components of the chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as the same are disposed during deposition processing. As seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a chamber body <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> that defines a chamber enclosure <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In this exemplary aspect the pedestal <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is fixedly mounted in the chamber enclosure <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> on a shaft <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which, in turn, is fixedly mounted on a bottom <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the chamber body <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The pedestal <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be heated by a coil (not separately shown) and is provided to support a wafer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> during deposition processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> A slit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is formed in a side wall <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the chamber body <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to allow access to the chamber enclosure <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for loading and unloading the wafer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. A slit valve <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> selectively closes the slit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. A robot blade <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is shown poised adjacent the slit valve <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A showerhead <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is suspended from the top <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. During deposition processing, a process gas flows through the showerhead <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> toward the wafer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> An exhaust port <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> formed in the chamber body <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> connects an exhaust pump (not shown) with an exhaust channel <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The exhaust channel <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is covered by a first plate <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> having holes <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> formed therein. A pumping ring <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> covers first plate <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and exhaust channel <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. In accordance with conventional practice, the pumping ring <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is provided to promote a uniform distribution of exhaust gases in the chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> during deposition processing. (As will be appreciated by those who are skilled in the art, pumping ring <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> has holes formed therein to allow exhaust gases to flow through pumping ring <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> into exhaust channel <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, although the holes are not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, which is a somewhat schematic plan view showing only pumping ring <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and edge ring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>.) A removable liner <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is installed on the chamber body <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> adjacent the exhaust channel <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> A substrate lifter such as a plurality of lift pins (of which one pin <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is shown) is provided to selectively lift the wafer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> from the pedestal <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> An edge ring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> (such as a shadow ring or purge ring) is provided above and at the periphery of the pedestal <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to shield the edge of the wafer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> from process gas during deposition processing as is conventionally known. During processing, edge ring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is supported on pedestal <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and pumping ring <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is supported on liner <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and on step <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> of side wall <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of chamber body <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> A lift plate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is provided to selectively actuate substrate lifter <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Extending upwardly from the lift plate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is an extension <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The extension <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> has a top surface <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> which is positioned slightly below edge ring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and pumping ring <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> during processing. On other occasions the top surface <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of extension <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> contacts the edge ring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and the pumping ring <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> at a contact point <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) to raise and support pumping ring <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and edge ring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Continuing to refer to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, lift plate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is selectively raised and lowered by an actuator <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. In the aspect shown, the actuator <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> has a plunger <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> which moves inside a sleeve <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The lift plate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is mounted on the plunger <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. The plunger <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is connected to an upper flange <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of a bellows <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. A lower flange <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of the bellows <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is connected to a housing <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the actuator <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. A substantially cylindrical assembly housing <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> defines a space within which the actuator <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, the plunger <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and the lift plate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are installed. Assembly housing <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is substantially concentric with plunger <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. The space inside bellows <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is at atmospheric pressure, whereas the space between bellows <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and assembly housing <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is in the environment of the chamber enclosure <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and is at low pressure during processing. Purge gas is introduced between assembly housing <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and bellows <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> via a fitting <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. An O-ring <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> seals the joint between the assembly housing <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and the chamber body <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Assembly housing <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, actuator <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> including plunger <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, sleeve <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and bellows <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> constitute an actuator assembly that may be pre-assembled prior to installation on the chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The geometry of assembly housing <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> assures that the plunger <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of actuator <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> will be properly aligned for vertical movement relative to the chamber body <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by means of a horizontal flange <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> on the assembly housing that is secured to the bottom of the chamber body <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The actuator <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, plunger <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and lift plate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> including its extension <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> make up a lift mechanism <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> that both actuates the substrate lifter <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and selectively raises and lowers the edge ring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and the pumping ring <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Although only one lift mechanism <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is shown in the drawings, it should be understood that a respective lift mechanism may be provided for each of the plurality of wafer lift pins referred to above. Alternatively, a single lift mechanism may be provided to actuate all of the wafer lift pins (or a wafer lift hoop) and to contact the pumping ring <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and/or the edge ring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> at all of the contact points <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Referring now to FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A-B (top plan and side elevation views showing the interface between the edge ring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and the pumping ring <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>) and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> (a side elevational view of the extension <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>), the extension <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> has a protrusion <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> that extends upwardly from the top surface <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the extension <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. At each point of contact <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>) the edge ring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> has a horizontally extending tab <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> that includes a slot <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. The protrusion <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> of the extension <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is received in the slot <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> of the edge ring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to properly align the edge ring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> with respect to the pedestal <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). Continuing to refer to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, at times when the extension <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> supports edge ring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and pumping ring <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, the tab <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of the edge ring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> rests on the top surface <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the extension <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. At such times, the pumping ring <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> also rests on the top surface <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the extension <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Pumping ring <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> has a recess <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> that allows the tab <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of the edge ring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to share the top surface <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the extension <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In operation, wafer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is supported on pedestal <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> during deposition processing as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Edge ring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is positioned to shield the edge of wafer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> from process gas so that deposition does not occur on the edge of the wafer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Pumping ring <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> covers exhaust channel <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Substrate lifter <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is retracted at or below the top surface of the pedestal <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and lift plate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is also retracted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Upon completion of a deposition process, lift plate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is raised by actuator <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, to initially raise pumping ring <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and edge ring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> via extension <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, and subsequently also to actuate substrate lifter <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> to lift wafer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> from pedestal <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Slit valve <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> opens, to allow robot blade <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to enter the chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The resulting condition is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. In the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, pumping ring <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and edge ring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are fully elevated, and do not obstruct the path of travel of robot blade <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> or interfere with movement of wafer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The lift plate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is then lowered to lower the substrate lifter <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> to place wafer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> on robot blade <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. It will be recognized that simultaneously with the lowering of substrate lifter <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, pumping ring <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and edge ring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are lowered. However, as the substrate lifter <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> lowers, pumping ring <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and edge ring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are not lowered below an intermediate or partially lowered position (indicated in phantom at <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) at which pumping ring <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and edge ring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> do not interfere with movement of the robot blade <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the wafer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> After the wafer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is deposited on the robot blade <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> by the substrate lifter <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, the robot blade <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is retracted from the chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to remove the processed wafer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Shortly afterwards, the robot blade <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> again enters the chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, carrying a new wafer to be processed. The lift plate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is raised again to raise the substrate lifter <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> to lift the new wafer from the robot blade <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. It will be recognized that pumping ring <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and shadow blade <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are raised from their intermediate position <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) to the fully elevated position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> simultaneously with the raising of substrate lifter <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Thus the position of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> again results, but with a new wafer in place of the processed wafer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. With the new wafer supported on the substrate lifter <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, the robot blade <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is again retracted from the chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Lift plate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is then fully lowered, lowering substrate lifter <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> to place the new wafer on the pedestal <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and continuing to lower lift plate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> so that the pumping ring <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and the edge ring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are lowered to their processing positions shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. At the same time, substrate lifter <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is again completely retracted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> From an examination of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, and based on the previous discussion, it will be recognized that the lift mechanism <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> has two ranges of movement, including a first range of movement from the point at which lift plate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is fully retracted. In the first range of movement of lift mechanism <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, the pumping ring <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and the edge ring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are lifted by extension <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, but lift plate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> does not yet contact substrate lifter <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and therefore does not raise substrate lifter <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Then, in a second range of movement of the lift mechanism <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> above the first range of movement, pumping ring <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, edge ring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and substrate lifter <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are raised simultaneously by the lift mechanism <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In the aspect of the inventive CVD chamber described herein, the heated pedestal <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is fixedly mounted in the chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Thus in this aspect there is no need to provide a lift mechanism for the pedestal <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and the cost of manufacturing the chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is reduced. Alternatively, or additionally, a single lift mechanism <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> may be provided both to actuate the wafer substrate lifter <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and to move the pumping ring <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and the edge ring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> between a processing position in which pumping ring <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and edge ring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> obstruct transfer of the wafer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and a retracted position in which the pumping ring <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and edge ring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> do not interfere with transfer of the wafer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, since a single lift mechanism may be used for two or more of the substrate lifter <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, the pumping ring <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and edge ring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the mechanism for the chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be simplified and the cost of manufacturing reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The foregoing description discloses only an exemplary embodiment of the invention; modifications of the above-disclosed apparatus and method which fall within the scope of the invention will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. For example, the present invention has been described in the context of a CVD chamber, but it is understood that the present invention may have application to other processes, process chambers and apparatuses, such as PVD and etch processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, as described above, the present invention contemplates using a single lift mechanism to actuate a wafer substrate lifter and to elevate an edge ring and/or a pumping ring where a fixedly mounted pedestal is employed in the processing chamber. However, it is also contemplated to use a single lift mechanism for actuating a wafer substrate lifter and retracting an edge ring and/or a pumping ring even when a moveable pedestal is employed in a processing chamber. It is also contemplated that the lift mechanism used to actuate the wafer substrate lifter may also be used to elevate only an edge ring or a pumping ring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In the exemplary embodiment disclosed herein, edge ring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is adapted to shield an edge of a wafer during CVD processing. However, as the term &ldquo;shadow ring&rdquo; is used in the claims, it includes any surface which overlaps a portion of a substrate and protects it from the associated process to which a remaining portion of the substrate is subjected. It specifically includes edge rings and clamp rings associated with PVD, CVD and electroplating processes, while the term &ldquo;edge ring&rdquo; includes both shadow rings and purge rings (e.g., rings that protect the edge of a wafer without overlapping the wafer&apos;s edge). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, while the present invention has been disclosed in connection with preferred embodiments thereof, it should be understood that other embodiments may fall within the spirit and scope of the invention, as defined by the following claims. </paragraph>
