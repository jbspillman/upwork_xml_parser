<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE PRESENT INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a flint type lighter, and more particularly to a lighter incorporated with an improved ignition system for preventing under age children from the usage of the lighter. Thus, no residue of the flint will stick on an adult&apos;s thumb after the ignition of the lighter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Arts </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Modem butane lighters have become very popular, especially the flint type lighters since they are economy and cheap, easy operation, and easy to fight the fire. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> However, the conventional flint type lighters have drawbacks in their usage. During the ignition of the lighter, a spark wheel must be rotated in order to strike a spark when a pusher button is depressed for releasing gas. When the quality of the flint is poor, the spark generated may not strong enough for ignition. Moreover, the actions of rotating the spark wheel and depressing the pusher button are not in on continuous motion leads to different operational results depending on the users. Moreover, when the sparks wheel gives friction to the flint in order to strike a spark, the residue of the flint will remain on the spark wheel of the lighter. So, during rotating the spark wheel, the residue of the flint may stick on an adult&apos;s thumb. In worse circumstance, the user may repeat to rotate the spark wheel when failure ignition, the user&apos;s thumb may get painful and dirty as well. Although the conventional flint type lighters are cheap and in usual shape, it is desirable to improve their drawbacks for more practical use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Nowadays, a piezoelectric lighter is getting more popular wherein the piezoelectric lighter comprises a piezoelectric unit for generating piezoelectricity. The user can merely depress the pusher button in order to ignite the lighter. However, the piezoelectric unit is widely used in a high class lighter but it is not widely used in a disposable lighter because the cost of the piezoelectric unit, especially the good quality piezoelectric unit, is too high to install in the disposable lighter. The use of the piezoelectric lighter is still restricted in certain circumstances. So, an alternative is sought for. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> An improved flint type disposable lighter comprises a striker blade for substituting the conventional spark wheel to strike a spark against the flint. In order to ignite such disposable lighter, the user must apply a radial pulling force on the pusher button to pull the striker blade outwardly in such a manner that the spark will be generated through a mutual friction between the striker blade and the flint to ignite the lighter. So, in the ignition process, the user&apos;s thumb will not directly in contact with the striker blade so as to prevent the residue of the flint stunk on the user&apos;s thumb. However, the spark may not strong enough to ignite the emitting gas which leads the failure ignition of the lighter. So, the user may merely to ignite the lighter repeatedly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, it is now required a safety device for preventing under age children form the usage of the lighter. The present invention provides not only a safety arrangement avoiding the lighter to be ignited accidentally but also a solution to solve the drawbacks set forth above. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The pusher button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is slidably disposed in the pusher cavity <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of the casing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in a vertically movable manner wherein the pusher button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is arranged in such manner that when the pusher button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is depressed downwardly with respect to the casing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, an depressible end <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> of the gas lever <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is depressed downwardly so as to pivotally lift up the gas emitting nozzle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for releasing gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The trigger protrusion <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is outwardly protruded from a front wall <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight> of the pusher button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> wherein the trigger protrusion <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> has at least an engaging tooth <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> provided on an front end thereof and adapted for slidably engaging with the gear teeth <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> of the driving wheel <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> to drive the striker wheel <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to rotate when the pusher button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is depressed downwardly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The trigger protrusion <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is integrally and frontwardly extended from the front wall <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight> of the pusher button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and arranged to align with the driving wheel <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> wherein a downward traveling distance of the trigger protrusion <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> must be at least equal to a radial traveling distance of the striker wheel <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> that enough to strike a spark against the flint <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. In other words, when the pusher button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is downwardly depressed from its normal upper position to its lower ignition position, the trigger protrusion <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is adapted to radially rotate the striker wheel <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to strike a spark against the flint <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The resilient element <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is normally retaining and urging the pusher button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in an upper normal position wherein the resilient element <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> has two ends biasing against the pusher button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the ceiling of the casing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The resilient element <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, according to the preferred embodiment, is a compression spring which is disposed in the pusher cavity <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and is provided between the pusher button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and a bottom surface of the pusher cavity <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The resilient element <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> has two ends biasing against a ceiling of the pusher button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the bottom surface of the pusher cavity <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the resilient element <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is adapted for applying an urging pressure against the pusher button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> so as to normally urge and retain the pusher button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in the upper normal position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The ignition system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> further comprises a guiding means <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> for ensuring the spark being stroked between the striker wheel <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the flint <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> wherein the guiding means <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> comprises an elastic blocking arm <highlight><bold>271</bold></highlight> integrally and downwardly extended from a rear wall <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> of the pusher button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for normally biasing against an inclined top edge of an outer wall <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> of the casing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, the blocking arm <highlight><bold>271</bold></highlight> has a round bottom end <highlight><bold>271</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>normally biased against the top edge of the rear wall <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> of the casing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> wherein when the pusher button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is depressed downwardly, the bottom end <highlight><bold>271</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is forced to slide along the top edge of the outer wall <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> of the casing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and received in the pusher cavity <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. It is worth to mention that a normal rotation of the striker wheel <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> cannot strike a spark against the flint <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. In order to produce a spark, an instantaneous rotational force must be applied on the striker wheel <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to frictionally engage with the flint <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>.

Thus, the inclined top edge of the outer wall <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> of the casing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> will help the bottom end <highlight><bold>271</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the blocking arm <highlight><bold>271</bold></highlight> to slide downwardly into the pusher cavity <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. When the depressing force applied on the pusher button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is released, the pusher button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is pushed upwardly and return to its upper normal position, the bottom end <highlight><bold>271</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the blocking arm <highlight><bold>271</bold></highlight> will be rebounded to its original form to slidably bias against the top edge of the outer wall <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> of the casing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The guiding means <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> further comprises a pair of blocking latches <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight> outwardly protruded from two sidewalls <highlight><bold>243</bold></highlight> of the pusher button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for biasing against two L-shaped top edges of two sidewalls of the pusher cavity <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> respectively, so as to retain the pusher button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in the normal upper position and prevent the pusher button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> being slid out of the pusher cavity <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The lighter of the present invention further comprises a safety device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for preventing the lighter from being ignited accidentally and intentionally.

<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The safety device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> further comprises a locking member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> slidably mounted on a top ceiling <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> of the pusher button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> comprising a pair of L-shaped locking arms <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight> slidably penetrated through the slider cavity <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and arranged to be driven to move from a normal locking position to an unlocked position, and an elastic element <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> for applying an urging pressure against the locking member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> so as to normally retain the locking member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> at the normal locking position. In which, in the locking position, the locking arms <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight> of the locking member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> are biased against two top edges of the supporting walls <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> respectively for blocking up the pusher button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> from being slid downwardly. In the unlocked position, the locking member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is pushed inwardly to move the two free ends of the locking arms <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight> aligning with the sliding grooves <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, such that the pusher button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is capable of being slid downwardly while the two ends of the locking arms <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight> are sliding on the sliding grooves <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, so as to ignite the lighter, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the safety device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> further has a pair of parallel guiding tracks <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> provided on the top ceiling <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> of the pusher button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and a pair of corresponding projections <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> downwardly formed on the locking member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and arranged to slidably mounted on the guiding tracks <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> respectively, so as to ensure a sliding movement of the pusher button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> on the pusher button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the elastic element <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, which is a compression spring disposed in the slider cavity <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> has two ends for biasing against the locking member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and the pusher button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> respectively, so as to urge and retain the locking member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> in the normal unlocked position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The pusher button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> further comprises two opposed L-shaped guiding arms <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> integrally extended from the front wall <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight> of the pusher button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> wherein two free ends of the guiding arms <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> are slidably mounted on the two sliding grooves <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> on the supporting walls <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> respectively, so as to ensure a vertical movement of the pusher button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> within the pusher cavity <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the gas lever <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> has a downwardly bent depressible end <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> arranged to be driven downwardly to pivotally lift up the gas emitting nozzle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The pusher button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has a front slanted surface <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight> provided on a bottom portion of the front wall <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight> thereof wherein the front slanted surface <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight> of the pusher button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is frictionally engaged with the depressing end <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> of the gas lever <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in such a manner that when the pusher button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is depressed downwardly, the depressing end <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> of the gas lever <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is driven downwardly, so as to pivotally lift up the gas emitting nozzle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for releasing gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The pivotal actuating motion of the gas lever <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is shorter than the radial rotating motion of the striker wheel <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> wherein these two motions are operated by a slide down motion of the pusher button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. So, the downward movement of the pusher button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for frictionally sliding on the depressible end <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> of the gas lever <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> can be self-adjusted to fit the motion to radially rotate the striker wheel <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, so as to prevent the distortion of the gas lever <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> over a period of continued use of the lighter. It is worth to mention that such actuation arrangement can incorporate with a conventional piezoelectric lighter that requires a slide down motion of the pusher button to depress the piezoelectric unit and the gas lever at the same time to ignite the lighter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In order to ignite the lighter of the present invention, an inward force must be applied on the locking member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> until the two locking arms <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight> are aligned right above the two sliding grooves <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> respectively, so as to unlock the lighter. Then, an instantaneous depressing force must be applied on the pusher button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for pushing the bottom end of the blocking arm <highlight><bold>271</bold></highlight> to move away from the top edge of the casing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and thus the gas lever <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is frictionally driven by the pusher button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> downwardly for releasing gas. Simultaneously, the engaging tooth <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> of the trigger protrusion <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is slidably engaged with the gear teeth <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> of the driving wheel <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> respectively so as to drive the striker wheel <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to rotate. So, a spark will be generated through the mutual friction between the circumferential coarse striking surface <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> of the striker wheel <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the flint <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. When the depressing force applied on the pusher button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is released, the resilient element <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> will push the pusher button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> upward to its upper normal position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>, a second embodiment of the lighter illustrates an alternative mode of the first embodiment of the present invention, wherein the guiding means <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>&prime; has a guiding slot <highlight><bold>271</bold></highlight>&prime; formed on an inner wall of the pusher button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>&prime; and an elastic blocking arm <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight>&prime;, having a top blocking tip <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a&prime;, </italic></highlight>upwardly extended from the pusher cavity <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>&prime; wherein the blocking tip <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>&prime; is normally engaged with the guiding slot <highlight><bold>271</bold></highlight>&prime; so as to lock up the pusher button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>&prime; in the upper normal position.
