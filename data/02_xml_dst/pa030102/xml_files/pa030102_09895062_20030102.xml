<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND INFORMATION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to microprocessor (chip) power regulation. More specifically, the present invention relates to a system and method for providing an appropriate amount of voltage to a microprocessor based on information received by a voltage controller from said microprocessor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Typical personal computers utilize a power supply to distribute a base potential of, for example, five volts (direct current, DC) to the various components of the system. In a continuing effort to minimize power consumption as well as heat production, developers strive to minimize chip voltage requirements. In order to convert the initial five-volt supply to an appropriate value for the chip, voltage regulation of some kind is required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A typical chip requirement has been 3.5 volts. In order to supply the correct amount of voltage to the chip, the manufacturer (or whomever may be the installer), reads a label on the chip providing voltage identification (VID) and, depending on the method available, &lsquo;straps&rsquo; (by clip, solder bridge, etc.) the chip&apos;s pins in a manner to provide the necessary potential. As an alternative, the hardware manufacturer or configurer might avoid using straps (&lsquo;jumpers&rsquo;) by utilizing a series of &lsquo;fuses&rsquo;. The manufacturer would burn a specific combination of fuses to encode the appropriate VID, describing the voltage requirements of the chip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> provides an illustration of the parallel interface between a microprocessor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and a voltage regulator <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> via a communication line <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> in the art. Upon system configuration, the voltage regulator (VR) <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> interprets an encoded VID, which has been communicated from the microprocessor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and directs the appropriate amount of voltage to the microprocessor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. With the five bits of resolution provided by this parallel interface, no more than thirty-two different voltage requirements can be identified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> With several parameters, such as minimization of heat and power consumption as well as performance optimization, affecting voltage requirements of today&apos;s chips, the variance in required voltage amongst chips and the precision with which the voltage is to be met is continually increasing. This, combined with the fact that typical voltage requirements of chips is steadily decreasing with the reduction of chip size, causes there to be difficulty choosing the appropriate voltages to be represented by the 32-value range such that the range has both sufficient variance and sufficiently fine granularity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> There are different systems in the art for transmitting information between devices for use in device configuration and management. For example, the System Management (SM) Bus (Version 2.0; SBS Implementors Forum; Aug. 3, 2000), a derivative of the Inter-Integrated Circuit (I<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>C) by Phillips Semiconductor&trade;, was developed to provide a communication link between an &lsquo;intelligent&rsquo; battery, a charger for the battery, and a microcontroller that communicates with the rest of the system. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates the operational layout of a generic SM Bus. Device 1 <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> passes data, such as system management information, via a communication line <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> to Device 2 <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. To regulate the timing of transmission and reception of the data, a clock signal is utilized and is transmitted via a clock signal line <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. Although this system provides for transmission of management information, it has many critical deficiencies, as explained below, limiting its ability to regulate a microprocessor&apos;s voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> There is a need to improve current systems of microprocessor voltage regulation such that voltage range granularity and variance are increased and quantity of necessary pin connections is reduced, as well as several other desired improvements. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> provides a diagram illustrative of a serial VID interface under principles of the present invention. In one embodiment, having initial configuration coding for the microprocessor (chip) <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> incorporated into the combination of (pulsed and unpulsed) chip fuses <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, the voltage identifier (VID) is extracted for communication to a voltage regulator (VR) <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. Upon system power-up, voltage levels are unstable and/or erratic. In one embodiment, the VR <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> and the chip <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> have defined roles in sequencing the power supply <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>. First, the VR <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> brings up an auxiliary power supply to power the chip&apos;s <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> power well <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. When the chip <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> has detected a valid power level at the power well <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, the chip <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> reads the intended VID from the chip fuses <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> and communicates the VID to the VR <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. At this point, in one embodiment, the VR <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> has started an RC timer (VIDPowerGood <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>). When VIDPowerGood <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> tells the VR <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> that enough time has elapsed (and therefore, that the auxiliary power supply is valid), the VR <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> starts to listen for VID communicated by the chip <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. When the VR <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> receives a valid VID command sequence, the VR <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> commands the power supply <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> to turn on and establish the commanded voltage level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the present invention, the VID is transmitted serially via a communication line <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> to the VR <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. Upon start-up, the system clock is not yet stable. Therefore, in one embodiment, the chip <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> produces and communicates its own VID clock signal via a line <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> between the chip <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and the VR <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. This clock signal is used for the timing of transmission and receipt of data/acknowledgement signals. Because only one common clock is utilized, there is no need for clock speed matching through Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) methods or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Supplying the proper voltage to the chip <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is very important. If the voltage is too low, the chip <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> may cease to operate. If the voltage is too high, the chip may be irreparably damaged. Therefore, making sure the proper VID (representative of the appropriate voltage) is communicated and received by the VR <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> is critical. One aspect of assuring the accuracy of data transmission is clock verification. To protect against errors caused by noise on the clock signal line <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, in one embodiment, a guard clock signal is provided via a separate, guard clock line <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>. As explained below, the guard signal is analyzed in relation to the clock signal to verify the value of the clock signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Further, in one embodiment, to verify receipt of the VID data, a VID acknowledgement signal is transmitted from the VR <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> to the chip <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> via an acknowledgement line <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. As explained below, in one embodiment, the acknowledgement signal is checked by a two-part receipt verification, high-to-low and low-to-high. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, upon receipt of the serial VID data, the VR <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> decodes the information and directs a programmable power supply <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> to provide the chip <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> with the correct amount of voltage via a voltage supply line <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the process of checking and adjusting the chip <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> voltage can be reconfigured at various times to accommodate various changing parameters of the chip <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> or power supply <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, such as whether the power supply is drawing power from an external source or from a battery or whether the temperature of the chip <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> or power supply <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> is above its threshold. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> provides a communication timing chart of signal lines between the microprocessor and voltage regulator with regard to the clock signal and guard signal operation under principles of the present invention. In one embodiment, at any given time during transmission of the VID Data <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, the signal may be at either a binary &lsquo;1&rsquo; <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> or binary &lsquo;0&rsquo; <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>. In order to be reliably sampled, VIDData must not change during the period of &lsquo;set-up&rsquo; time (Tsu) <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> and &lsquo;hold&rsquo; time Th <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. In order to verify the accuracy of clock reception, when the VR <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) in one embodiment perceives a transition of the clock signal <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> between binary values, the guard signal <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> is sampled. In one embodiment, to verify accuracy of clock signal <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> perception, when the clock signal <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> is perceived to transition from high (&lsquo;1&rsquo;) to low (&lsquo;0&rsquo;), the guard signal <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> is sampled <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>. During the high-to-low clock transition, the guard signal must be high (&lsquo;1&rsquo;) for clock verification. In one embodiment, when the clock signal <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> is perceived to transition from low (&lsquo;0&rsquo;) to high (&lsquo;1&rsquo;), the guard signal <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> is sampled <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight>. During the low-to-high clock transition, the guard signal must be low (&lsquo;0&rsquo;) for clock verification. Further, the sequence of these clocking signals must be verified as appropriate, e.g., a VIDClock <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> low-to-high transition with VIDGuard <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> sampled low must be ignored unless the previous VIDClock <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> high-to-low transition sampled VIDGuard <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> high. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> This clock verification process is utilized to prevent potential noise on the clock line <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) from causing a clock signal <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> misidentification, which could cause a wrong value to be received as the VID&mdash;a dangerous situation. As stated above, if too much voltage is supplied to the chip, damage may result. If too little voltage is supplied, the chip may stop operating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> provides a timing chart illustrative of signal line activity with regard to acknowledgement timing under principles of the present invention. In one embodiment, after the reception by the VR <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) of a complete data packet via the data line <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>), an acknowledgement statement <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> is returned by the VR <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>), verifying receipt by the VR <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) to the chip <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). In one embodiment, some sequence of bits, ending at point A <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>, at the end of a data packet will serve as a request for an acknowledgement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The pattern ending at A <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>, which triggers the acknowledgement, is clocked into the VR <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> one cycle before the acknowledgement is clocked out. (See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) During that cycle, in one embodiment, the logic in the VR <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> evaluates whether acknowledgement is needed or not. (See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) In one embodiment, when each guarded rising edge of VIDClock <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight> occurs, the evaluated acknowledgement signal is waiting at the input of a storage element, such as the D input of a flip flop (not shown). The guarded VIDClock <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight> rising edge propagates <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> the evaluated acknowledgement signal to the VIDAck&num; <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> pin with a clock to output delay. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, viewed from the perspective of the chip <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>), after bit A <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> is sent out, it takes an amount of time equal to the propagation delay (T<highlight><subscript>pd</subscript></highlight>) times two, plus the time from clock output (T<highlight><subscript>co</subscript></highlight>). This is provided in the figure as &lsquo;T<highlight><subscript>co</subscript></highlight>&plus;2T<highlight><subscript>pd</subscript></highlight>&rsquo; <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>. Travel time (T<highlight><subscript>pd</subscript></highlight>) must pass before the data is received by the VR <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). Then, the VR <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) must wait for the next clock trigger (T<highlight><subscript>co</subscript></highlight>), which is the transition of the clock signal <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight> from low to high, before sending the acknowledgement <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>. The chip <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) won&apos;t receive the acknowledgement <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> until after another amount of travel time (T<highlight><subscript>pd</subscript></highlight>) has passed. Therefore, it takes &lsquo;T<highlight><subscript>co</subscript></highlight>&plus;2T<highlight><subscript>pd</subscript></highlight>&rsquo; for the return of the acknowledgement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the present invention, for reliability (verification) purposes, the chip <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) will not recognize an acknowledgement <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> until it senses on the acknowledgement signal line <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) a transition from high to low, followed by a transition from low to high. Only after sensing both transitions in the proper order and with appropriate timing will the chip <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) accept the acknowledgement <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> as being reliable. In one embodiment, &lsquo;appropriate timing&rsquo; is defined such that the signal must be: (1) high at a particular rising VIDClock <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight>; (2) low at the next; (3) low at the next; and (4) high at the next. This timing detects many cases where the transmitter and receiver are out of synchronization, or noise in the system looks like (could be mistaken for) an acknowledgement signal. In one embodiment, no single-bit noise corruption would lead to an acknowledgement received where no acknowledgement was intended. This redundant acknowledgement verification is utilized to prevent acknowledgement <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> misidentification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Further, in one embodiment, two bits of data are transferred <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> for every clock cycle <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>. This is known as &ldquo;double-pumping&rdquo;. In one embodiment, the data signal <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> from the chip <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) to the VR <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) is &lsquo;double-pumped&rsquo;, but the acknowledgement signal <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>, traveling in the opposite direction, is not double-pumped. It operates at a one-to-one correlation. By contrast, the SM Bus mentioned above and illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, transfers data <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> on a one-to-one timing correlation with its clock <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>. (It does not utilize a guard clock and utilizes an acknowledgement signal multiplexed on SMData <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Further, in one embodiment of the present invention, the microprocessor input and output may use different, incompatible voltages. By contrast, in SM Bus, both SMBClock <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> and SMBData <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> are both inputs and outputs, so it impossible to support signaling environments where it is most convenient for input and output to have different levels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> provides a timing chart illustrative of signal line activity with regard to Command byte transmission under principles of the present invention. In one embodiment of the present invention, the data signal <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> provides a high-low bit sequence (10) <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> to preface the beginning of a Command byte <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the eight bits of the command byte <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> begin with the most significant bit (MSB) <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> and end with the least significant bit (LSB) <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> provides a timing chart illustrative of signal line activity with regard to Data Out byte transmission under principles of the present invention. In one embodiment of the present invention, the data signal <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> provides a low-low bit sequence (00) <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> to preface the beginning of a Data Out byte <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the eight bits of the command byte <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> begin with the most significant bit (MSB) <highlight><bold>806</bold></highlight> and end with the least significant bit (LSB) <highlight><bold>808</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> provides a timing chart illustrative of signal line activity with regard to Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)-8 byte transmission under principles of the present invention. In one embodiment of the present invention, the data signal <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> provides a low-high bit sequence (01) <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight> to preface the beginning of a CRC-8 byte <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, CRC-8, which is a form of error correction, is utilized to ensure accurate perception of the information provided by the data signal <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> provides a timing chart illustrative of signal line activity with regard to acknowledgement perception by the microprocessor under principles of the present invention. In one embodiment of the present invention as explained in part above, the acknowledgement signal <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> is sampled at each rising edge of the clock signal. The triangles <highlight><bold>1006</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> denote rising edges of the clock signal <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> used by the VR <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) to potentially enable VIDAck&num; <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> to be driven, and the circles <highlight><bold>1008</bold></highlight> denote each corresponding sample taken by the chip <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) of the acknowledgement signal <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> in one embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> provides a timing chart illustrative of signal line activity with regard to Synchronization byte transmission under principles of the present invention. In one embodiment, all communication is done a bit at a time over the VIDData <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> line. In one embodiment, these bits are grouped into higher level structures (&lsquo;command&rsquo; byte, etc.). In one embodiment, the synchronization byte is used to establish a common understanding of where the high level structures begin and end. In one embodiment as explained in part above, synchronization <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight> is triggered by five consecutive binary &lsquo;highs&rsquo; in a row of the data signal <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, there exists no communication scenario where five binary &lsquo;highs&rsquo; in a row would be utilized, except for synchronization <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight>. This prevents the misperception of a synchronization trigger <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight> during a normal communication transmission. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> provides a timing chart illustrative of signal line activity with regard to a typical communication sequence for providing VID to a voltage regulator under principles of the present invention. In one embodiment, the data signal <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight> first provides a command byte to the VR <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>), which is preceded by a &lsquo;10&rsquo; preface. In one embodiment, the data signal <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight> then provides a data byte <highlight><bold>1208</bold></highlight>, which is preceded by a &lsquo;00&rsquo; preface <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight>. As previously stated, the data byte <highlight><bold>1208</bold></highlight> incorporates the VID to be transmitted to the VR <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). In one embodiment, the data signal <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight> then provides a CRC-8 byte <highlight><bold>1212</bold></highlight>, which is preceded by a &lsquo;01&rsquo; preface <highlight><bold>1214</bold></highlight>. Following the CRC-8 byte <highlight><bold>1212</bold></highlight> and the request for acknowledgement in one embodiment, an acknowledgement <highlight><bold>1216</bold></highlight> is returned from the VR <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> (See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
