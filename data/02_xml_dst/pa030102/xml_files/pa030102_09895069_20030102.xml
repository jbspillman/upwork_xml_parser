<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Referring initially to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> of the drawings, there is shown a first surface mountable PTC chip <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> embodying the invention, which chip <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> has a flat rectangular cuboidal body <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and a pair of copper terminals <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> located at opposite ends <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of the body <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The chip body <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> has a pair of opposite end surfaces <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> covered by the respective terminals <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, a pair of left and right side surfaces <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and a pair of top and bottom surfaces <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. The chip body <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is formed by three conductive PTC polymer sheets <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and four electrolytic copper foils <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> which interlace with the polymer sheets <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> to form a multi-layered structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Each of the two outer copper foils <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is formed with a gap <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> that extends transversely across the chip body <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The gap <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> divides the corresponding copper foil <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> into two, relatively larger and smaller electrodes <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> on the corresponding top/bottom body surface <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. The two gaps <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> are located at the same horizontal distance but from opposite body end surfaces <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, such that each body end <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is associated with a pair of larger and smaller electrodes <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> from the opposite top and bottom surfaces <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The two inner (intermediate) copper foils <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> extend horizontally in opposite directions from respective opposite end surfaces <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of the chip body <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, where their edge faces are exposed. However, each of the copper foils <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> reaches short of the other opposite end surface <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> at the far end, thereby forming a respective gap <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> at the far end extending transversely across the chip body <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Each inner copper foil <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is pre-formed with an aperture to form the respective gap <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>, upon being cut out from a blank of larger copper foil. The two polymer sheets <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> immediately above and below each of the gaps <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> merge integrally together through and filling up the gap <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> as a result of a hot pressing process, whereby all the three polymer sheets <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> are integrated into a one-piece PTC element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Each terminal <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> has a rectangular C-shaped cross-section and is formed by using a plating process on the corresponding end <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of the chip body <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The terminal <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> covers the entire end surface <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and the adjoining portions of the top and bottom body surfaces <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. The terminal <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is in electrical contact or connection with the pair of larger and smaller electrodes <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> associated with that body end <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and also in electrical connection with the exposed edge face of the relevant inner copper foil <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> extending from the same body end <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. By means of the corresponding sets of interconnected outer electrodes <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and inner copper foil <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> (acting as the third electrode), the two terminals <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> allow electrical current to flow through the one-piece PTC element <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> for operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The two terminals <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> also serve as supports for mounting and connecting the PTC chip <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> on a printed circuit board by means of soldering in a flow soldering process. A semi-cylindrical recess <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is formed at the central position of each end <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of the chip body <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, extending vertically across the top and bottom body surfaces <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. The recess <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is formed prior to the formation of the corresponding terminal <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, such that the terminal <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> assumes the same recessed surface profile as the end surface <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The recessed surface profile of the body end surfaces <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> increases the length of the exposed edge faces of the inner copper foils <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, whereby the contact area between the said exposed edge faces and the inner surfaces of the respective terminals <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is increased to achieve better electrical connection. By reason of the recessed surface profile, the outer surface area of the terminals <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> available for soldering is increased, which does not only improve the strength of the soldering connection but also introduces interlocking between the terminals <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the solder to avoid lateral displacement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The middle portion of the outer copper foil <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> as exposed between the two terminals <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, including the gap <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>, on each top/bottom surface <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> of the chip body <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is protected by a respective insulating layer or solder mask <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> deposited thereon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The method of manufacturing the PTC chip <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> will now be described. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference> shows a lamination <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of four electrolytic copper foils <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and three interlacing conductive PTC polymer sheets <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, which acts as a blank from which a number of PTC chips <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are to be made. The two inner copper foils <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are pre-cut by using a stamping process to form an array of apertures that act as the aforesaid gaps <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. The lamination <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is assembled tight by subjecting the stack of copper foils <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and polymer sheets <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to a hot pressing process, whereby the polymer sheets <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> adhere the interlacing copper foils <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> together, with the polymer sheets <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> merging integrally together through and filling up the aforesaid apertures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference> shows the formation of combined straight slots <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and circular holes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> vertically through the lamination <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by drilling and milling operations to form the recessed end surfaces <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of the bodies <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of the PTC chips <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Opposite sides of the slots <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> form the general end surfaces <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, whereas opposite sides of the holes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> form the semi-cylindrical central recesses <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> in the end surfaces <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The inner surfaces of the slots <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and holes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, together with the portions of the top and bottom outer lamination surfaces surrounding them, are then plated with a copper coating to eventually form the terminals <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</cross-reference> shows the formation of oblong gaps <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in each of the top and bottom copper foils <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by any commonly known etching method. The gaps <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> eventually form the aforesaid gaps <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>, as part of the formation of the electrodes <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> on the top and bottom surfaces <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> of the chip bodies <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</cross-reference> shows the formation of insulating layers or solder masks <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> on the outer surface of each of the top and bottom copper foils <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> covering the gaps <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, which eventually form the solder masks <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> on the top and bottom surfaces <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> of the chip bodies <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Finally, the lamination <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is cut along lines <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to produce individual PTC chips <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Referring next to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference> showing a second surface mountable PTC chip <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> embodying the invention, this chip <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> has almost the same construction as the first PTC chip <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and is manufactured by identical method, with equivalent parts designated by the same reference numerals increased by &ldquo;100&rdquo;. The only difference lies in the shape of the recesses <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> at respective opposite ends <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> of the chip body <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, and in turn the shape of the terminals <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> dictated thereby. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, each of the recesses <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> has an inwardly curved shape, when viewed from above or below, occupying the entire width of the respective body end <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, thereby resulting in a convex overall surface profile for the body end <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. The aforesaid advantages also exist in the present recessed surface profile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Referring then to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference> showing a third surface mountable PTC chip <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> embodying the invention, this chip <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> has almost the same construction as the second PTC chip <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and is manufactured by identical method, with equivalent parts designated by the same reference numerals increased by &ldquo;100&rdquo;. The only difference lies in the shape of the recesses <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> at respective opposite ends <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> of the chip body <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, and in turn the shape of the terminals <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> dictated thereby. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, each of the recesses <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> has a shape which resembles a flat letter &ldquo;V&rdquo; when viewed from above or below and occupies the entire width of the respective body end <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, thereby resulting in a flat V-shaped overall surface profile for the body end <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. The aforesaid advantages also exist in the present recessed surface profile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> It is understood that the body <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> of each PTC chip <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> may comprise at least two conductive PTC polymer sheets <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> and at least one intermediate conductive metal foil <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Reference is now made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference> of the drawings, there is shown a fourth surface mountable PTC chip <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> embodying the invention, which chip <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> has similar construction as the first PTC chip <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and is manufactured by almost the same method, with equivalent parts designated by the same reference numerals increased by &ldquo;300&rdquo;. In terms of construction, there are two differences both concerning the terminals <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Each terminal <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> is likewise produced by using a plating process on the corresponding end <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> of the chip body <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. The terminal <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> is in the form of a rectangular cap (formed by an end wall and four side walls as shown) covering the entire end surface <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> and the adjoining portions of all four side surfaces of the body <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> surrounding that body end <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>, i.e. the top and bottom surfaces <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> and the left and right side surfaces <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>. Compared with the aforesaid terminals <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, the present terminals <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> includes additional left and right side walls <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight> which are in electrical contact or connection with adjoining portions of the exposed left and right edge faces respectively of the relevant inner copper foil <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> extending from the same body end <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The presence of the left and right side walls <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight> increases the contact length or area of each terminal <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> with the exposed edge faces of the relevant inner copper foils <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> i.e. the end edge face and adjoining portions of the left and right side edge faces, thereby achieving better electrical connection. By reason of the presence of such side walls <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight>, the outer surface area of each terminal <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> available for soldering is increased, which does not only improve the strength of the soldering connection but also introduces interlocking between the terminal <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> and the solder to avoid lateral displacement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>D show the method of manufacturing the PTC chip <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, which is substantially the same as the method of manufacturing the first PTC chip <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> as described in relation to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>D, with equivalent parts designated by the same reference numerals increased by &ldquo;10&rdquo;. The only difference lies in the shape and location of the holes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in the present case, which are equivalent to the previous circular holes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Each hole <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is rectangular (or square) in shape and is located at a position relative to the relevant slot <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and corresponding to a corner position for a PTC chip <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> to be cut out from the lamination <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, to provide a right-angled corner for the PTC chip <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. Due to the presence of the hole <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, a left/right side surface of the respective corner of the PTC chip <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is exposed for plating with copper to form the left/right wall <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight> of the resulting terminal <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> It is understood that the body <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> of the PTC chip <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> may comprise at least two conductive PTC polymer sheets <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> and at least one intermediate conductive metal foil <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Referring finally to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</cross-reference> showing a fifth surface mountable PTC chip <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> embodying the invention, this chip <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> has almost the same construction as the fourth PTC chip <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and is manufactured by identical method, with equivalent parts designated by the same reference numerals increased by &ldquo;100&rdquo;. The major difference lies in the use of only one single PTC polymer sheet <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> and hence omission of two inner copper foils. The two outer copper foils <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> of course remain, which interlace with the polymer sheet <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> to form a sandwiched structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The invention has been given by way of example only, and various modifications of and/or alterations to the described embodiments may be made by persons skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the invention as specified in the appended claims. </paragraph>
