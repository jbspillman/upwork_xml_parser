<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to voice mail systems. More specifically, the present invention relates to a method and apparatus for remote management of voice messages from a voice mail system, such as through use of a cellular telephone. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Currently some wireless services offer message waiting and similar services where voice mail messages can be stored in a voice mail system and delivered through a wireless communication network, such as a cellular telephone network, after a call is specifically made to the voice mail system to retrieve the voice mail messages. In some systems, the number of stored voice mail messages can be determined by looking at the display of a phone that has been powered-on. However, knowing only the number of voice mail messages stored in a voice mail system is not sufficient for active users and subscribers who need up-to-date information for business, education and other purposes. Furthermore, such a system has no advantage at all if the cellular telephone is roaming out of its calling area or cannot obtain a carrier signal. If the cellular telephone is roaming, then the cellular telephone network providing the roaming service has no knowledge of whether that cellular telephone has messages waiting in a voice mail system of another cellular provider. Of course, if the cellular telephone is outside the service area of any cellular network, then the cellular telephone cannot make any calls, much less retrieve information concerning voice mail messages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Existing cellular network voice mail systems can forward a voice mail message notification (or message waiting indicator) to a subscriber of a voice mail system indicating that the subscriber has one or more voice mail messages waiting for retrieval. This notification can include additional information such as caller ID, the calling number of the party leaving the voice mail message, and an index listing the various messages so that a subscriber can scroll through them and retrieve a particular voice mail message. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The addition of speech memory to a cellular telephone that is already provided with voice compression and expansion circuitry can act as a recording device during a conversation on the cellular telephone. Consequently, such a telephone could be used as an answering machine, wherein an incoming message is recorded in the memory and, upon the pushing of a button on the control pad of the telephone, the stored message is played back to a person utilizing the telephone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> However, these systems have not solved all the problems that exist in the field of cellular voice mail systems. There is an acute need for today&apos;s business people to have access to devices and systems that help them receive and manage voice mail messages while they are away from those locations that grant them direct access to their voice mail system. The devices must be capable of receiving and organizing information and conveniently providing the information to the user on demand and in a format appropriate to the message. Moreover, the devices must be dynamic and flexible, allowing the user to easily reconfigure them as needs change. For example, some users have different sets of information that must be available at different times and there is a need to easily change from one set to another, regardless of location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> There is a need for a method to contact the cellular telephone&apos;s voice mail system when the cellular telephone is roaming. What is also needed is a method for a cellular telephone to easily reach its voice mail messages when the cellular telephone cannot obtain a carrier signal. Additionally, a method is needed to archive voice mail messages by transferring voice mail messages from a cellular telephone&apos;s memory to another memory medium, such as a personal computer or another cellular telephone, whereby additional cellular telephone memory would be made available for other voice mail messages. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a system comprising a voice mail server for storing voice mail messages and a cellular telephone, personal computer, remote server or other computers that can retrieve copies of the stored voice mail messages and then transfer the voice mail messages between themselves. The system is configured to enable the cellular telephone to retrieve its voice mail messages from a voice mail server, remote server, personal computer or a second cellular telephone in computer readable format. In the present invention, a cellular telephone can retrieve voice mail messages from any service providing storage and retrieval of voice mail messages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the invention provides for a personal computer or a remote server to retrieve voice mail messages from a voice mail recorder/player. In this embodiment, a voice mail recorder/player cannot be synchronized with another computer and is capable of delivering voice mail messages only in spoken voice format (i.e., non-computer readable format). The personal computer or remote server, using a conventional modem or other communication medium, establishes a connection with the voice mail recorder/player and records the voice mail messages in a computer readable format, such as WAV or MP3. A cellular telephone can then retrieve the voice mail messages from the personal computer or remote server by connecting to the personal computer or remote server over the Internet or other computer network or connection. The connection by the remote server or personal computer to the voice mail recorder/player may be established automatically at set point intervals or, alternatively, may be established manually. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, a voice mail message may be stored on a voice mail server in computer readable format. A personal computer, remote server, or cellular telephone may then synchronize with the voice mail server and retrieve voice mail messages in computer readable format, such as WAV. The remote server or personal computer may retrieve the voice mail messages through the Internet using a conventional browser. A cellular telephone may retrieve the voice mail messages through the Internet using a conventional microbrowser. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Similarly the invention provides for a first cellular telephone to transmit voice mail messages to a second cellular telephone in computer readable format. This can be especially useful if the voice mail message contains detailed instructions, directions or is a group of many voice mail messages, because the transfer of the voice mail message in computer readable format can be performed quicker than if transmitted as a voice transmission. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Additionally the invention provides for a cellular telephone to synchronize with a personal computer to transfer voice mail messages between the two devices, to arrange them into convenient groups, files, or directories in the personal computer, and then to download these conveniently grouped voice mail messages to the cellular telephone&apos;s memory, thereby facilitating local retrieval of a voice mail message when needed. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method for transferring messages in computer readable format, such as WAV, between a personal computer or server and a cellular telephone to retrieve voice mail messages from a voice mail system. Callers who can&apos;t reach a cellular telephone, either because it was turned off, out of the service area, or unanswered, often leave messages in a voice mail system for later retrieval by the cellular telephone user. In the method of the present invention, voice mail messages are converted to computer readable format and stored on the voice mail system&apos;s server. The voice mail messages can then be downloaded into another remote server, a personal computer, or a cellular telephone when they are connected, via the Internet or other means, to the voice mail system&apos;s server. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The present invention also relates to a method for transferring voice mail messages in computer readable format, such as WAV, between one cellular telephone and another cellular telephone. This permits the rapid transfer of information, which may contain detailed instructions or directions, directly to a cellular telephone&apos;s memory from another cellular telephone&apos;s memory, without having to take the time to play the information over the airwaves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The present invention also describes a method for a remote server to connect to a voice mail system and download any stored voice mail messages assigned to a particular subscriber. A cellular telephone can then be connected to the remote server to retrieve the voice mail messages and store the messages in its own local memory. This method has the advantage of allowing a cellular telephone to collect current voice mail messages from the remote server even when the cellular telephone is out of its service area, either because it is roaming or because it cannot pick up a carrier signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the present invention describes a method for organizing voice mail messages, stored in a computer or in a cellular telephone&apos;s memory, into convenient groups, directories, or folders formatted in a way to be compatible between the computer and the cellular telephone&apos;s memory. Voice mail messages are downloaded from the cellular telephone for archiving, thereby freeing up memory available for storing voice mail messages on the server. Other voice mail messages can be uploaded to the cellular telephone, for example, new voice messages stored on the personal computer or old messages that had been archived on the personal computer. Groups, folders, or directories created on the computer and voice mail messages stored in them may be uploaded to the cellular telephone to facilitate voice mail message retrieval when needed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The present invention is not limited only to retrieving messages from a cellular network voice mail system. Any voice message service that allows a service subscriber to retrieve messages left by an outside caller is applicable to the present invention. The present invention provides a solution for managing voice mail messages by allowing a cellular telephone access to its assigned voice mail messages whenever and wherever desired and further provides a powerful means for storing and manipulating voice mail messages for greater efficiency and convenience. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a schematic diagram showing the system of the present invention. The cellular network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> interconnects the various components of the cellular network&apos;s system. The pertinent components to the present invention includes a voice mail recorder/player <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to record messages left by outside callers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> when they fail to establish a connection with a cellular telephone, either because it was turned off, was outside the service area, or not answered. A voice mail server <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> alternatively can record, in a computer readable format, a voice mail message left by the outside caller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and store it on a drive <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> made of a computer readable medium. The voice mail server <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can be connected to the Internet <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> enabling a voice mail system subscriber to retrieve voice mail messages by accessing a cellular network&apos;s web page via a cellular telephone <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, personal computer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> or another remote server <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. A receiver/transmitter <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> sends and receives conversations or voice mail messages to or from a cellular telephone <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, an outside caller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> or another cellular telephone <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, thereby allowing a cellular system subscriber to converse over a cellular telephone <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> or to retrieve voice mail messages from an assigned portion of the voice mail recorder/player <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The system components may be connected by a network, such as a LAN (localized area network) or WAN (wide area network). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The subscriber&apos;s network <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> interconnects the various components of that network&apos;s system. The pertinent components include a cellular telephone <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> capable of communicating with a personal computer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the cellular telephone can be connected to a remote server <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> or any other computer suitable for such a connection. Voice mail messages are stored on the drive <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> of the personal computer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> or the drive <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of a remote server <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, or alternatively, any other suitable computer readable medium. Both the remote server <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the personal computer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are tied into the Internet <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, and therefore are accessible to a cellular telephone <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> that is connected to the Internet or the voice mail server <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The remote server <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> can call the voice mail system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to retrieve messages through a telephone connection <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, using, for example, a modem. The system components may be connected by a network, such as a LAN (localized area network) or WAN (wide area network). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Both the subscriber&apos;s network <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the cellular network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are the media used to provide communication links between the various devices and computers interconnected within the systems. The networks <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may include permanent connections, such as wire or fiber optic cables, or temporary connections made through telephones or wireless communications. Personal computers and servers may be represented by a variety of computing devices, such as mainframes, personal computers, personal digital assistants (PDA&apos;s), and Internet-connected cellular telephones. The networks <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may include additional servers, routers and other devices not shown. Both systems <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are connected to the Internet <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> representing a worldwide collection of networks and gateways that use the TCP/IP suite of protocols to communicate with one another. Of course, the systems <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may also include a number of different types of networks, such as, for example, an intranet, a local area network (LAN), or a wide area network (WAN). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The present invention could be implemented in a variety of software environments. A typical operating system may be used to control program execution within the systems <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, although the preferred embodiment described below includes a browser within the subscriber&apos;s network <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as the agent that exchanges data in the security protocols with the cellular network. The browser does not have to be a conventional browser, e.g., Netscape Navigator or Microsoft Internet Explorer&reg;. In order to secure the information transmitted to and from the remote server, it may be capable of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) technology exchanged in a security protocol such as the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) version 3.0 and above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The browser for the cellular telephone is a microbrowser. A microbrowser is an Internet browser designed for use with a wireless handheld device such as a cellular telephone. Microbrowsers have small file sizes to accommodate the low memory available to handheld devices and the low-bandwidth constraints of the wireless-handheld networks. Microbrowsers using the wireless application protocol (WAP) are available from, among others, Openwave Systems, Inc. of Redwood, Calif. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The voice mail server <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> includes a conventional server software program such as International Business Machines&apos; Websphere&reg;, for administering the interaction with equipment users. The server software includes application programs that enable the server <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to manage the voice mail database, other databases, and execute various instructions in response to communications from various voice mail system users or subscribers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference> depict a typical cellular telephone used in the present invention. The cellular telephone <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> includes an antenna <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> for transmitting signals to and from the cellular network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The cellular telephone <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> includes a modulator <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>A, a transmitter <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, a demodulator <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>A, a receiver <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, and a controller <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> that provides signals to the transmitter and receives signals from the receiver. These signals include speech and/or computer readable files. Also connected to the controller <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are a conventional speaker <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> and microphone <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, a display <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and an input device, typically a keypad <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The keypad includes keys <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, which are numeric and alphanumeric keys typically found on a telephone, and other keys <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, used for operating the cellular telephone including, but not limited to, a power key, a SEND key, and various menu scrolling and soft keys. Also included is a processor <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> and a network interface <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, such as a conventional modem, and a battery power source <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
