<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Technical Field </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed generally toward rating systems for online auctions. In particular, the present invention is directed toward a method, computer program product, and apparatus for providing a user rating service for online auctions that uses objective rating criteria to promote fairness and that allows ratings to be shared among online auction services. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In any society in which division of labor is present, there exists the fundamental problem of valuation. When a person exchanges goods or services for other goods, services, money, or other resources, it is always necessary to make an inquiry into the value of the goods, services, or money exchanged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> According to basic principles of economics, trading resources according to their proper valuation should bring about the most efficient use of available resources. In practice, however, valuation of resources is anything but easy. Each party in an economic transaction can be assumed to be acting in his or her own best interest, and that best interest is almost certainly opposed to that of the other, assuming a two-party transaction. Thus, a seller will want to receive a high price for a good, and a buyer will want to pay a low price (no price at all is even better). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> To complicate matters, many resources are difficult to value simply because the parties to a transaction have access to only limited information about the resource. A prime example of this is corporate stock. The ownership rights to a portion of a corporation are difficult to value, simply because much of the information pertaining to a corporation and its earning potential is not public, and much of what is public cannot be predicted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> To solve this fundamental problem of valuation, people have, over time, devised different market mechanisms or negotiating schemes for determining resource values. Auctions, where buyers submit bids and certain buyers &ldquo;win&rdquo; (buy the product) and other buyers &ldquo;lose&rdquo; (are prevented from buying the product) are a common market mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Online selling through the Internet has made it simpler to search for and purchase products (particularly hard to find items), because of automated searching. Online auctioning, in particular, is a convenient means for buying and selling products, because, unlike conventional auctioning, online auctioning is not limited by any physical space&mdash;anyone can buy or sell from anywhere in the world. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> This enormous flexibility is not without some drawbacks, however. Many merchants and consumers are less than reputable&mdash;that much is axiomatic. For this reason, merchants and consumers in a physical environment attempt to shield themselves from disreputable commercial conduct in a number of ways. These range from the objective (e.g., relying on a credit report to screen customers) to the subjective (e.g., relying on one&apos;s intuitive sense of a person&apos;s honesty to screen customers or merchants). In an online environment, however, many of these safeguards disappear. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> As an attempt to remedy this inability to screen potential business contacts, the online auction house eBay, Inc., of San Jose, Calif., has developed a rating system, whereby buyers and sellers rate other buyers and sellers with whom they do business. This rating system provides users of eBay&apos;s online auction facility with information they can use when deciding when to do business with another user. Thus, eBay allows its users to view others&apos; subjective observations with regard to other users. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The eBay rating system, however, is purely subjective and must rely solely on user comments. This is problematic for two reasons. One is that new users, who have little or no ratings from other users, are at a disadvantage, because their ratings will be low until enough other users give them positive ratings. Another is that it is easy to abuse such a rating system by engaging in sham transactions with co-conspirators to give each other high ratings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Another drawback to eBay&apos;s rating system is that the information that eBay collects is only usable at eBay&apos;s website. It cannot be used at other Internet auction sites. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> What is needed, then, is a rating system that includes some objective criteria for determining ratings. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> With reference now to the figures, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> depicts a pictorial representation of a network of data processing systems in which the present invention may be implemented. Network data processing system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is a network of computers in which the present invention may be implemented. Network data processing system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> contains a network <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, which is the medium used to provide communications links between various devices and computers connected together within network data processing system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Network <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may include connections, such as wire, wireless communication links, or fiber optic cables. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In the depicted example, server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is connected to network <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> along with storage unit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. In addition, clients <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> are connected to network <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. These clients <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> may be, for example, personal computers or network computers. In the depicted example, server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> provides data, such as boot files, operating system images, and applications to clients <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Clients <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> are clients to server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Network data processing system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may include additional servers, clients, and other devices not shown. In the depicted example, network data processing system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is the Internet with network <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> representing a worldwide collection of networks and gateways that use the TCP/IP suite of protocols to communicate with one another. At the heart of the Internet is a backbone of high-speed data communication lines between major nodes or host computers, consisting of thousands of commercial, government, educational and other computer systems that route data and messages. Of course, network data processing system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> also may be implemented as a number of different types of networks, such as for example, an intranet, a local area network (LAN), or a wide area network (WAN). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is intended as an example, and not as an architectural limitation for the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> block diagram of a data processing system that may be implemented as a server, such as server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, is depicted in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Data processing system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may be a symmetric multiprocessor (SMP) system including a plurality of processors <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> connected to system bus <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, a single processor system may be employed. Also connected to system bus <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is memory controller/cache <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, which provides an interface to local memory <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>. I/O bus bridge <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is connected to system bus <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and provides an interface to I/O bus <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. Memory controller/cache <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and I/O bus bridge <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> may be integrated as depicted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Peripheral component interconnect (PCI) bus bridge <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> connected to I/O bus <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> provides an interface to PCI local bus <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. A number of modems may be connected to PCI local bus <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. Typical PCI bus implementations will support four PCI expansion slots or add-in connectors. Communications links to network computers <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> may be provided through modem <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> and network adapter <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> connected to PCI local bus <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> through add-in boards. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Additional PCI bus bridges <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> provide interfaces for additional PCI local buses <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>, from which additional modems or network adapters may be supported. In this manner, data processing system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> allows connections to multiple network computers. A memory-mapped graphics adapter <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and hard disk <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> may also be connected to I/O bus <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> as depicted, either directly or indirectly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the hardware depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> may vary. For example, other peripheral devices, such as optical disk drives and the like, also may be used in addition to or in place of the hardware depicted. The depicted example is not meant to imply architectural limitations with respect to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The data processing system depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> may be, for example, an IBM e-Server pSeries system, a product of International Business Machines Corporation in Armonk, N.Y., running the Advanced Interactive Executive (AIX) operating system or LINUX operating system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> With reference now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> block diagram illustrating a data processing system is depicted in which the present invention may be implemented. Data processing system <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is an example of a client computer. Data processing system <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> employs a peripheral component interconnect (PCI) local bus architecture. Although the depicted example employs a PCI bus, other bus architectures such as Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) and Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) may be used. Processor <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and main memory <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> are connected to PCI local bus <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> through PCI bridge <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>. PCI bridge <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> also may include an integrated memory controller and cache memory for processor <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. Additional connections to PCI local bus <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> may be made through direct component interconnection or through add-in boards. In the depicted example, local area network (LAN) adapter <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, SCSI host bus adapter <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, and expansion bus interface <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> are connected to PCI local bus <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> by direct component connection. In contrast, audio adapter <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>, graphics adapter <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>, and audio/video adapter <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> are connected to PCI local bus <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> by add-in boards inserted into expansion slots. Expansion bus interface <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> provides a connection for a keyboard and mouse adapter <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, modem <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>, and additional memory <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>. Small computer system interface (SCSI) host bus adapter <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> provides a connection for hard disk drive <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight>, tape drive <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight>, and CD-ROM drive <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. Typical PCI local bus implementations will support three or four PCI expansion slots or add-in connectors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> An operating system runs on processor <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and is used to coordinate and provide control of various components within data processing system <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The operating system may be a commercially available operating system, such as Windows 2000, which is available from Microsoft Corporation. An object oriented programming system such as Java may run in conjunction with the operating system and provide calls to the operating system from Java programs or applications executing on data processing system <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. &ldquo;Java&rdquo; is a trademark of Sun Microsystems, Inc. Instructions for the operating system, the object-oriented operating system, and applications or programs are located on storage devices, such as hard disk drive <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight>, and may be loaded into main memory <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> for execution by processor <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the hardware in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> may vary depending on the implementation. Other internal hardware or peripheral devices, such as flash ROM (or equivalent nonvolatile memory) or optical disk drives and the like, may be used in addition to or in place of the hardware depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Also, the processes of the present invention may be applied to a multiprocessor data processing system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> As another example, data processing system <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> may be a stand-alone system configured to be bootable without relying on some type of network communication interface, whether or not data processing system <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> comprises some type of network communication interface. As a further example, data processing system <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> may be a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) device, which is configured with ROM and/or flash ROM in order to provide non-volatile memory for storing operating system files and/or user-generated data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The depicted example in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and above-described examples are not meant to imply architectural limitations. For example, data processing system <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> also may be a notebook computer or hand held computer in addition to taking the form of a PDA. Data processing system <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> also may be a kiosk or a Web appliance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> provides an overall view of a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Internet <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> connects web clients <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> with various servers. Web clients <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> contain browser software for viewing hypertext documents from servers within the World Wide Web. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Hypertext is a method of organizing textual and graphical information on a computer screen. Information is organized into &ldquo;pages,&rdquo; which resemble printed pages in a book or (perhaps more accurately) printed scrolls (since a hypertext page can be of any length). The primary difference between hypertext and the printed word, however, lies in the fact that hypertext pages can contain links. That is, a portion of a hypertext document, such as a phrase or a graphic, may be made sensitive to clicking by the mouse such that when the user clicks on that portion, the user is directed to a new page or a different section of the current page. For instance, it is a common practice to make bibliographic citations into links. When a user clicks on one of these citations, the cited text appears on the screen. Hypertext documents are displayed using a program called a &ldquo;browser.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The largest and best-known repository of hypertext documents is the World Wide Web, a loosely bound collection of publicly accessible hypertext documents stored on computers the world over. The World Wide Web has become the preferred Internet medium for publishable information as well as for providing such interactive features as online shopping&mdash;to the extent that the terms Internet and World Wide Web are virtually synonymous to some. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Browsers can download hypertext documents from a server with the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP). HTTP allows a browser to request documents or files from a server and receive a response. In addition, when browser users enter information into a form embedded into an hypertext page, the browser transmits the information to a server using HTTP. Form information can then be passed along to applications residing on the server by way of the Common Gateway Interface (CGI). Those applications can then return a result, which may be written in HTML. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Registration server <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>, an HTTP-enabled server, functions as the main contact point for establishing user accounts. A user of web client <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, may register as a buyer or seller by entering appropriate information into a hypertext form and transmitting the information to registration server <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>. Registration server <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> collects this information and combines it with objective information to form a user rating. The objective information may include a credit report from credit reporting service <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, for instance. The user rating may be calculated by any appropriate formula. Registration server <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> stores the user&apos;s rating in registration database <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Auction web server <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>, an HTTP-enabled server, functions as the main contact point for online auctions. Auction web server <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> communicates with merchandise database <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight>, which stores information regarding items being auctioned, current bids, and auction times. A seller using web client <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> can, for example, interact with auction web server <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> through hypertext-based forms to establish an auction for a particular item. A buyer using web client <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, for example, can then place bids for an item by transmitting data from a hypertext form to auction web server <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Rating server <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight>, which may or may not be the same as registration server <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>, handles requests for and updates of users&apos; rating information. Rating server <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> stores the users&apos; rating information in ratings database <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>, which may or may not be the same as registration database <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>. Having a separate rating server and database storing only a subset of information may provide an added security benefit, as the separate rating server and database need not have direct access to sensitive use data, such as a user&apos;s credit report. Auction web server <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> requests a user&apos;s rating information from rating server <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> whenever the user wishes to take part in a buy or sell transaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Preferably, multiple auction web servers utilize the information stored in rating server <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight>. In a preferred embodiment, rating server <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> is operated by a trusted third-party that is neither directly affiliated with any users nor directly affiliated with any of the online merchants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Trading history server <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> records users&apos; transactions in trading history database <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight>. Trading history server <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> cooperates with rating server <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> to update users&apos; ratings as they engage in buying and selling transactions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> provides a tabular diagram describing information stored in each of the databases of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Table <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> describes the contents of data records stored within registration database <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>. User ID <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> contains information for identifying and authenticating a user, including a user identification string, a password, and the user&apos;s real name. Address information <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> contains addresses and telephone numbers for contacting the user or shipping products to the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Rating level <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> is calculated based on objective data, such as credit information <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> (q.v.), and positive and negative feedback from other users. Buying limit <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> and selling limit <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> provide maximum monetary amounts of items that the user may buy or sell. These limits may be defined with respect to a time period (e.g., the maximum dollar amount that may be bought within any given month) or they may be defined with respect to one or more transactions (e.g., the maximum value of an item that may be sold by the user). Much like a credit limit on a credit card, these limits protect sellers from buyers who may tend to overextend their finances and limit the potential losses incurred by buyers who buy from less reputable sellers. Credit information <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> is used to derive buying limit <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> and selling limit <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>; it may also be used in determining a value for rating level <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Table <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> describes the data contained within ratings database <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>. Ratings database <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> contains a user ID <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight>, rating <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight>, buying limit <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>, and selling limit <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> for each user. Ratings database <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> thus comprises a subset of the information in registration database <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Table <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight> describes the contents of merchandise database <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight>. For each individual auction, item identification information <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight>, an identification of the seller <highlight><bold>528</bold></highlight>, a quantity to be sold <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>, a description of the item <highlight><bold>532</bold></highlight>, an optional photo or image of the item <highlight><bold>534</bold></highlight>, and a time period over which the auction takes place <highlight><bold>536</bold></highlight> are stored. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Table <highlight><bold>538</bold></highlight> describes the information stored within trading history database <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight>. For each transaction (buy or sell) identifications of buyer and seller <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight>, a transaction date <highlight><bold>542</bold></highlight>, a transaction value <highlight><bold>544</bold></highlight>, seller comments about the buyer <highlight><bold>546</bold></highlight>, buyer comments about the seller <highlight><bold>548</bold></highlight> are stored. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a diagram depicting a process of registering a user in a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Web client <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> provides personal information <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> regarding the registering user to registration server <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>. If so authorized by the user, registration server <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> requests <highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight> credit information from credit reporting service <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>. Credit rating service <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> sends <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight> credit information to registration server <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>. Registration server <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> combines the credit information with the user&apos;s personal information to derive a reliability rating for the user. Registration server <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> then shares <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> the user rating and other pertinent information with rating server <highlight><bold>607</bold></highlight>. Finally, registration server <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> transmits <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> a user ID for the now registered user to web client <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a diagram depicting the establishment of an auction by a seller in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Web client <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>, operated by the seller, transmits <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> a request to set up an auction for a particular item or set of items to auction server <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>. Auction server <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> then requests <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> rating information regarding the seller from rating server <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>. Rating server <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> transmits <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> the seller&apos;s rating information back to auction server <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>. At this point, auction server <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> determines whether the proposed auction is allowable in light of the seller&apos;s rating information (e.g., the value of the auctioned item does not exceed the seller&apos;s selling limit or the seller has a high enough rating to establish an auction). If it is, then the auction is established. Finally, auction server <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> transmits notification of the approved or rejected auction to web client <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a diagram depicting the operation of an auction in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Web clients <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>806</bold></highlight> submit bids <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>808</bold></highlight> to auction server <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight>. Auction server <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight>, at the close of the auction, determines the winning bidder. Auction server <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> submits <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> a request to rating server <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> for rating information regarding the winning bidder. This information is transmitted <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight> back to auction server <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight>, which in turn transmits <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight> the information to web client <highlight><bold>818</bold></highlight>, operated by the seller. In this way, the seller can make informed decisions regarding whether to accept the results of the auction (from a legal standpoint, in most auctions the seller makes the final acceptance of the contract between the buyer and seller) how payment and shipping of the item will be handled. For instance, if the buyer is not reputable, the seller may require payment in advance before shipping the item. In addition, auction server <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> may intervene and prevent a transaction from occurring, if the buyer would be overextending the buyer&apos;s buying limit. Finally, trading history server <highlight><bold>822</bold></highlight> is notified of the transaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> At some later time, trading history server <highlight><bold>822</bold></highlight> will report its updated information concerning the buyer and seller to rating server <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight>, including any feedback from the buyer or seller regarding the transaction. Feedback may be transmitted to auction server <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> from a web client by either the buyer or seller and recorded by trading history server <highlight><bold>822</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a flowchart representation of a process of registering a user (a buyer or seller) within a rating system in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. First, a user logs on (accesses) the registration server (step <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight>). Then, the user provides personal information, such as a name, address, and perhaps one or more identification numbers, such as a social security number, for obtaining a credit report, if the user so authorizes (step <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight>). The registration server creates a reliability rating for the user based on the provided information (step <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>). Then, the registration server updates the rating server to include the new rating (step <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight>). Finally, the registration server provides a user ID to the now registered user (step <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is a flowchart representation of a process of establishing an online auction in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. First, a seller logs into an auction (web) server using the seller&apos;s user ID (step <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>). Then, the seller identifies to the auction server the items to be auctioned, their approximate value, and the seller&apos;s reliability rating (step <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight>). The auction server then uses the seller&apos;s user ID to verify the seller&apos;s rating; it also verifies the approximate value of the items (step <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight>). Next, the auction server determines if the proposed auction comports with what the seller is allowed to do in terms of selling (i.e., whether the seller is reliable enough to be allowed to sell, and if so, how much merchandise the seller may sell) (step <highlight><bold>1006</bold></highlight>). If not, then the auction server rejects the auctioning of the items (step <highlight><bold>1008</bold></highlight>). If so, however, the auction server lists the items within its merchandise database for potential buyers to place bids on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is a flowchart diagram depicting a process of conducting an auction in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Buyers bid for a listed item (step <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>). The auction server receives the bids (step <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>). At the close of the auction, the auction server selects the highest bidder (step <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight>). At this point, the rating of the highest bidder is retrieved from the rating server (step <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>); the auction server may intervene at this point to prevent the actual purchase from taking place, if the auction server determines that the potential buyer&apos;s bid would overextend the buyer&apos;s buying limit. Next, the auction server notifies the seller of the results of the auction, including the buyer&apos;s reliability rating (step <highlight><bold>1108</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> At this point, the buyer and seller begin to perform the transaction according to how they negotiate payment and shipping terms (step <highlight><bold>1110</bold></highlight>). The auction server then updates the trading history server with information regarding the auction transaction (step <highlight><bold>1112</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is a flowchart representation of a process of creating or updating a user&apos;s reliability rating in a preferred embodiment of the present invention. First, user (buyer or seller) logs into the registration server (step <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight>). If the user is new (step <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight>), then the user is asked to authorize access to the user&apos;s credit information; if the user does not wish to provide this information (step <highlight><bold>1204</bold></highlight>), the user is given a &ldquo;basic rating&rdquo; (step <highlight><bold>1206</bold></highlight>), providing a low level of buying or selling privileges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> If the user does authorize the use of the credit information, the registration server obtains a credit rating from a credit information service (step <highlight><bold>1208</bold></highlight>). If the user&apos;s credit rating is positive (step <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight>), a higher-than-basic rating is calculated for the user (step <highlight><bold>1212</bold></highlight>). If the user&apos;s credit rating is negative, then the user receives a &ldquo;basic rating&rdquo; (step <highlight><bold>1214</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> If the user is not new (step <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight>), then the user is prompted as to whether to update the user&apos;s rating. If the user wishes to update the user&apos;s rating (step <highlight><bold>1216</bold></highlight>), a new rating based on the amount purchased or sold and any positive or negative feedback from other users is calculated for the user (step <highlight><bold>1212</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> If the user does not opt to receive the next rating, it is determined whether the user has positive information or trading history that would warrant an increase in rating (step <highlight><bold>1218</bold></highlight>). If so, then a new rating is calculated for the user (step <highlight><bold>1212</bold></highlight>). If not, the user retains the user&apos;s current rating (step <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> One of ordinary skill in the are will appreciate that many variations on the present invention are possible. For instance, in accordance with an alternative embodiment of the present invention, sellers&apos; reliability ratings can be displayed to prospective bidders, so that bidders may be more selective with their bidding. A number of other variations are possible by consolidating one or more subsets of the servers utilized; for instance, it is entirely possible for the registration server, rating server, trading history server, and auction server to all be the same server. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Also, a user who receives an unfavorable reliability rating may wish to discover why the user was rated poorly. In such cases, the user may be provided with an explanation for why the user was given a low rating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> It is important to note that while the present invention has been described in the context of a fully functioning data processing system, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the processes of the present invention are capable of being distributed in the form of a computer readable medium of instructions and a variety of forms and that the present invention applies equally regardless of the particular type of signal bearing media actually used to carry out the distribution. Examples of computer readable media include recordable-type media, such as a floppy disk, a hard disk drive, a RAM, CD-ROMs, DVD-ROMs, and transmission-type media, such as digital and analog communications links, wired or wireless communications links using transmission forms, such as, for example, radio frequency and light wave transmissions. The computer readable media may take the form of coded formats that are decoded for actual use in a particular data processing system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The description of the present invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description, and is not intended to be exhaustive or limited to the invention in the form disclosed. Many modifications and variations will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. The embodiment was chosen and described in order to best explain the principles of the invention, the practical application, and to enable others of ordinary skill in the art to understand the invention for various embodiments with various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated. </paragraph>
