<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> Windshield wipers on cars have traditionally been built around a rotational motor/transmission mechanism that is noisy and incapable of providing full coverage of the windshield. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A linear motor-based windshield wiper allows a blade to achieve full coverage of a windshield by permitting a wiper blade to be moved across its surface along a line that follows the windshield&apos;s shape rather than a center of rotation as in a traditional motor. In an embodiment, coils are embedded within or behind the windshield. Permanent magnets in a truck with a windshield wiper attached thereto are driven by appropriate actuation of the coils to sweep the blade across the windshield. When the wiper is turned off, the truck is controlled to move to one side where a capture mechanism engages it and locks it to the vehicle, thereby preventing theft. The capture mechanism may be mechanical, magnetic, or any other suitable device to preventing theft. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment, permanent magnets are embedded in the windshield and coils in the truck actuated to move the truck. In this embodiment, the coils in the truck may be powered by a battery recharged by induction, sliding contacts, etc. The truck may be permitted to move by means of wheels, ball bearings, an air bearing (by injection of air through channels in the windshield, for example), magnetic levitation, by sliding contact, or any other suitable mechanism.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The following references are hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth in their entireties herein: U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,595,870, 5,723,917, 5,519,266. These references describe linear motors and their control mechanisms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 2</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a windshield <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is wiped by a wiper <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> driven across the windshield by a linear motor consisting of a truck <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and multiple coils <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The coils <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be embedded within or behind the windshield <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. The truck <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> rides on wheels <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the truck may be magnetically levitated, driven over an air cushion, or made to slide in contact with the windshield on a low friction surface, such as a fluorocarbon polymer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> According to well-known principles, magnets <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are arrayed on the truck <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with alternating polarity. The coils <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may or may not have ferromagnetic cores <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> as is also known in the field of linear motors. The coils <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are shown in section at <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>. A controller (discussed with regard to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) controls the linear motor such as to drive the wiper <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> at selected speeds across the windshield <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Note that an alternative configuration to that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is to locate the coils within a non-ferromagnetic portion of a vehicle frame. In this way, the coils will not block light. This &ldquo;stator&rdquo; could be located below or above the windshield. If located below the windshield, the truck could be completely hidden by a portion of an engine cover as is used to hide, so-called, hideaway windshield wipers on most cars. Note that yet another alternative is to provide multiple wipers and trucks to allow faster clearing of rain for a given linear motor speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, in an alternative embodiment, permanent magnets <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> are provided in the stator (either within or on the windshield <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> as shown or in a portion of the vehicle body). The truck <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> carries the coils <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The coils <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be controlled by a wireless or metallic conductor to convey control signals. The control signals can be from the user interface with a controller on-board the truck or the controller can be in the vehicle with the control signals indicating the current and timing. The coils <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may have cores or not as indicated with respect to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The truck in the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> may receive power from a battery (not shown) in the truck <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> or power may be conveyed through metallic conductors (not shown) through sliding contacts (not shown) in the manner of an electric train. If a battery is used, the battery may be recharged when the truck <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is in a resting position adjacent a clamp mechanism <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. In the latter case, metallic contacts (not shown) may be used to recharge the truck <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> batteries. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> To keep the windshield wiper mechanism from being stolen, the clamp mechanism <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> catches the truck <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> when it is driven to a home position adjacent the clamp mechanism <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. The clamp mechanism <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> may positively engage and prevent release of the truck <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> until an actuator, under control of the controller (not shown here, but shown and discussed with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) permits its release. The clamp mechanism <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> has jaws <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> that may be urged by springs inwardly so that a catch <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> can enter between the jaws <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> passively. When the clamp mechanism <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is activated, it may be toggled to a lock position by an actuator (not shown; the specifics need not be discussed because many alternatives are a routine matter to design) which prevents the jaws from moving apart until the controller again toggles the clamp mechanism <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> to permit the jaws to be moved apart. In this way, power need not be supplied to the clamp mechanism <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> to secure the truck <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and wiper <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> linear motor-driven windshield wiper mechanism has two trucks <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>, one at either end of the wiper <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. The controller controls the two trucks synchronously to maintain the wiper <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> in an alignment suitable for clearing the windshield <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. Note that only one of the trucks <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is shown with a catch <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight> and clamp mechanism <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, but it is clear that both trucks <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> may be provided with respective such mechanisms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6, a</cross-reference> controller <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> controls the one or more trucks <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> by way of a winding power control circuit <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. The latter may be a power circuit that supplies power directly to windings (coils <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) embedded in the windshield <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> or it may include only control logic (analog or digital) to provide the proper sequencing for driving the current in the coils <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to move the trucks <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>. In the latter case, the winding power control circuit <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> would include a signal transmitter according to whatever scheme is employed to signal the truck <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> coils <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The controller <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> also controls the latch mechanism <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> to toggle it between its release and capture states. The controller <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> may be a digital controller or an analog controller. The controller receives commands from a user interface <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> which a user employs to turn the system on an off and alter the speed of the wiping action. </paragraph>
