<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to a rapid prototyping of micro-electromechanical structures. In particular, the present invention relates to an apparatus and method for fabricating encapsulated micro-channels in a substrate. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) provide a technology which enables the miniaturization of electrical and mechanical structures. MEMS is a field created primarily in the silicon area, where the mechanical properties of silicon (or other materials such as aluminum, gold, etc.) are used to create miniature moving components. In fact, the MEMS area has been applied to the miniaturization and integration of frequency selected devices to bring such devices to the chip level. In addition, MEMS has also been applied to biological systems in order to create fluidic micro-systems in the area of micro-fluidics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Micro-machining is a technology with specific application to MEMS systems and is broadly defined as the selective removal of silicon substrates to result in suspended structures on membranes. Both micro-machining and MEMS can also be applied to GaAs, quartz and ceramic substrates. Specifically, micro-machining can aid in the building of integrated circuits. For example, using direct-write ion beam milling, integrated circuits can be quickly and easily debugged, as well as verified. The verification and debugging occurs by milling of the circuits to cut and paste conductors, resistors, capacitors or the like, or change the conductance, inductance or resistance values of these devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Moreover, direct-write micro-machining provides significant advantages, as opposed to batch processing of circuits using traditional photo-lithographical techniques, which require the creation of masks in order to implement devices within integrated circuits. For example, in the area of micro-fluidics, conventional design of the various channels within the micro-fluidic devices requires the design of masks to create the structures on a fabricated wafer. As described above, this can be very time consuming. For example, in fluidic micro-systems, the characterization of channels generally requires wafer fabrication and the creation of masks in order to create and test such devices. Accordingly, the rapid prototyping of radio frequency (RF) micro-systems, as well as fluidic micro-systems, is not feasible using traditional techniques, such as photolithographic masking techniques, especially in bio-fluidic applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Therefore, there remains a need to overcome one or more of the limitations in the above-described, existing art. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> A method and apparatus for fabricating encapsulated micro-channels in a substrate are described. The method described includes the formation of a thin film layer over an area of a substrate. Following the formation of the thin film layer, a periodic array of access holes or windows are formed within the thin film layer along dimensions of one or more desired micro-channels. Following formation of the access windows, the one or more micro-channels are formed within an underlying layer of the substrate. Finally, the one or more micro-channels are encapsulated, thereby closing the one or more access windows along the dimensions of the desired micro-channels. Accordingly, the method is suitable in one context for rapid prototyping of micro-electromechanical systems in the areas of, for example, RF micro-systems, fluidic micro-systems and bio-fluidic applications. In addition, the method enables the rapid prototyping of integrated circuits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> An apparatus is also described. In one embodiment, the apparatus includes a thin film layer formed on an area of a substrate. Once formed, a periodic array of access holes are formed along dimensions of one or more desired micro-channels. Next, the micro-channels are etched from the substrate via the access holes. Finally, the access holes are closed by depositing a partial thin film layer over a surface of the thin film layer. In the context of micro-mechanical or micro-electromechanical structures, the apparatus describes a further miniaturization effort, for example, of fluidic micro-systems as well as RF micro-systems and devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without some of these specific details. For example, various thin film layers, access hole configurations, and micro-channels may be modified according to the teachings of the present invention. In addition, the following description provides examples, and the accompanying drawings show various examples for the purposes of illustration. However, these examples should not be construed in a limiting sense as they are merely intended to provide examples of the present invention rather than to provide an exhaustive list of all possible implementations of the present invention. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring the details of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> System Architecture </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is depicted. The substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is generally a silicon wafer, for example, a silicon wafer pacified with, for example, SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. A thin film or oxide layer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may be deposited or grown over the substrate <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The thin film layer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, which is in one embodiment silicon nitride, is provided with an optimized thickness <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> for minimized photon absorption during laser chemical etching and maximized mechanical stability. In one embodiment, a thickness (T) <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> of the thin film layer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is between 0.1 micrometers and 4.0 micrometers, but is most likely between 0.75 micrometers to 1.20 micrometers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</cross-reference>, a block diagram of the substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, including the oxide layer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, is depicted, which illustrates one or more periodic access holes or windows <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, . . . , <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>-N) formed within the oxide layer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The periodic access holes or windows <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> are formed using direct-write, chemically assisted focused ion beam etching. As described in further detail below, the periodic access windows <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> enable the formation of one or more micro-channels within the substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, the access windows <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> are etched within the oxide layer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and not within the substrate. As such, the periodic access windows <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> are formed along channel dimensions of one or more desired micro-channels in order to assist in the formation of micro-channels within the substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the access windows <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> enable fabrication of fully encapsulated micro-channels of arbitrary lengths and widths on the surface of a silicon substrate (and potentially other substrates) using existing direct-write etching tools. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, formation of the one or more micro-channels <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> within the substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is depicted. For example, a scan beam of a laser chemical etcher is performed in a region where a micro-channel is desired in order to provide optimal power density/spot size. In one embodiment, an argon ion laser <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> utilizes a scanning mirror <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> to etch the substrate with a molecular chlorine (Cl<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>gas ambient) in order to etch the underlying silicon. As described above, etching occurs along the desired channel dimensions defined by the periodic array of access windows <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> to form the one or more micro channels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The completion of the one or micro-channels <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> within the substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is illustrated with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</cross-reference>. As such, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> illustrates a free-standing oxide membrane or micro-channel <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, which exists along the remaining access windows <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. As described above, the creation of such micro-channels is vital to RF micro-systems, fluidic micro-systems and bio-fluidic applications. However, in order to enclose the micro-fluidic channels (as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference>) to provide the functionalities desired by the fluidic micro-systems, the one or more access windows are closed in order to encapsulate the micro-channels. Enclosure of the micro-channels is depicted with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>D. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Referring now to FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>D, these referenced figures depict various possible configurations of access holes within the thin film layer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> depicts a micro-channel within the substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. As depicted, the micro-channel <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> has a maximum desired depth (D) <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> while a separation distance (A) <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> between the edges of neighboring access holes <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is also illustrated. An optimal value for the separation distance A <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> between neighboring access holes <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> depends upon the geometric dimensions of the desired channel <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, as well as the gaseous pressure in the laser chemical etch chamber. In one embodiment, when the flow of reaction by-products out of the micro-channel <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and/or the reactant species is limited by molecular diffusion, then the access holes <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> should be placed periodically along the dimensions of the desired micro-channel <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5B and 5C</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment described, reaction by-products include for example, SiCl<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, whereas the reactant species is, for example, Cl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. In addition, limitations caused by molecular diffusion will result when either the rate of out-diffusion of by-products or in-diffusion of reactant is slow or comparable to the laser beam scan rate. As such, in the embodiment described, configuration of the access holes <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5B and 5C</cross-reference>, enable increasing of the uniformity of reactant and by-product distribution along the channel <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, this will lead to more uniform etching throughout the channel <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> However, if neither the flow of reaction by-products out of the micro-channel <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> nor the reactant species are limited by molecular diffusion, then the access holes <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> should be placed at edges of the micro-channel <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>, as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</cross-reference>. Accordingly, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>D, the reactant by-products and the reactant species are not limited by molecular diffusion since both the rate of out-diffusion of by-products and the in-diffusion of reactant is fast compared to the laser scan beam rate. Accordingly, configuration of access holes <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>D, prevents over-etching of the micro-channel <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>. Moreover, the beam should be scanned, at minimum, over exposed regions in order to prevent over-etching in these regions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> As such, etching of the silicon layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> will proceed almost isotropically wherever the laser beam is focused and there is a clear, unobstructed path for the reactant species. In other words, etching will be uniformly performed in all crystal orientations of the silicon substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Consequently, if the beam is continuously scanned over an access hole <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, the region of silicon below the access hole <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> will etch more than the remainder of the channel, which is referred to herein as an &ldquo;over-etch&rdquo;. Namely, if a regular period array of access holes <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is determined to be the optimal solution for process conditions, then the spacing of the access holes <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> from edge to edge or from center to center should be minimized. In one embodiment, spacing of the access holes <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> to center to center is performed if the width <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> of the access hole <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is small compared to the spacing A <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> between the various access holes, as is generally the case. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> depicts a block diagram illustrating formation of the micro-channel <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> to implement optimal spacing of the access holes <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, minimization of spacing A (<highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>) between the access holes is generally accomplished by finding the floor unit uniformity of the following equation: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>Uniformity&equals;1&minus;(<highlight><italic>A/</italic></highlight>2<highlight><italic>D</italic></highlight>).&emsp;&emsp;(1) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> As illustrated by uniformity is optimal at the value of one. This optimal value results from the fact that (1) either because A <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> is very small or (2) D <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> is very large. Consequently, as a general guideline, access hole separation distance A (<highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>) will be in the range of 100 nanometers to 1 millimeter, and will depend explicitly on the length and width of the desired micro-channel <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates the introduction of a partial oxide layer (not shown), which is used to close the one or more access holes <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> in order to recreate the thin film layer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the one or more access holes <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> are closed by tilting the substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to a predetermined angle (&thgr;<highlight><subscript>R</subscript></highlight>) <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. In the depicted embodiment, the substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is tilted to an angle of, for example, 45&deg; wherein a deposition of, for example a non-conformal layer of oxide is provided via, for example, a physical vapor deposition source. In one embodiment, this is accomplished by the deposition of sputtered oxide to form a partial oxide layer <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> that encloses the micro-channels <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> in order to form encapsulated micro-channel <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>). Alternatively, silicon nitride may be deposited over the thin film layer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment described, the variable &ldquo;A<highlight><subscript>ar</subscript></highlight>&rdquo; is defined as the aspect ratio of the depth (T) <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> of the oxide layer to the width (W) <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> of the access hole <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. As described above, the thickness of the film <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is generally in the range of 50 nanometers to 5 micrometers, whereas the width <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> of the various micro-channels is controlled by the focused ion beam etch and the desired tilt angle (&thgr;<highlight><subscript>R</subscript></highlight>) <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> of the final deposition. Accordingly, the angle of rotation &thgr;<highlight><subscript>R </subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> may be used to calculate the deposition angle (&thgr;<highlight><subscript>D </subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>) as the angle measured from the vector normal to the substrate surface, depending on whether the substrate or deposition is rotated, such that: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the method described uses a combination of focused ion beam/laser chemical etching and physical vapor deposition to fabricate encapsulated micro-channels on a silicon substrate. The teachings of the present invention enable applications in micro- electromechanical systems and specific application in bio-MEMS technology, which require micro-fluidic channeling, as well as fluidic micro-systems and RF micro-systems. Systems performed using the teachings of the present invention are hinged upon an angled physical vapor deposition process, i.e., sputtered oxide followed by an optional conformal oxide/diaelectric layer for planarization and additional reliability of the initial oxide layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> For example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</cross-reference> depict a heated membrane formed in accordance with the teaching of the present invention.

<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> depicts a block diagram illustrating a method <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> for fabricating one or more encapsulated micro-channels <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> within a substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, for example, as depicted with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. At process block <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>, a thin film or oxide layer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is formed over an area of a substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the oxide layer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may be formed over the substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> using a low temperature deposition. In one embodiment, the oxide layer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may be grown over an area of the substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment, the thin film layer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is, for example, a low temperature silicon nitride. In addition, the oxide layer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> should have an optimized thickness <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> for minimized photon absorption during laser chemical etching and maximized mechanical stability, as depicted with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Following formation of the oxide layer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, process block <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> is performed. At process block <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>, a periodic array of access holes or windows <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is formed within the oxide layer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, as depicted with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> As described herein, the terms &ldquo;access windows&rdquo; and &ldquo;access holes&rdquo; are used interchangeably depending on the dimensions of the access holes/windows. In one embodiment, the periodic access holes, or windows <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, are formed within the thin film layer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> using chemically assisted focused ion beam etching. As illustrated with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, the access windows, or holes, <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> do not protrude within or into the substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, but are formed solely within the oxide layer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Following formation of the access holes <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, process block <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> is performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> At process block <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight>, one or more micro-channels are formed within an underlying area of the substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, as depicted with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B. As depicted with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, in one embodiment an argon ion laser <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> utilizes a scanning mirror <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> in order to provide a scanned beam of the laser chemical etch in a region where a micro-channel is desired. By utilizing the periodic array of access windows <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, the scanned beam is provided with desired optimal power density/spot size, utilizing a molecular chlorine (CL<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) gas ambient in order to etch the underlying silicon <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and form the one or more micro-channels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Formation of a completed micro-channel <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is depicted with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, wherein <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> illustrates the micro-channel <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> formed within the substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and below the oxide layer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> via access windows <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. However, in order for a micro-channel to be utilized within a MEMS based system, the micro-channel <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> requires enclosure. Consequently, at process block <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight>, the one or more micro-channels <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> are encapsulated, as depicted with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 9</cross-reference>. As illustrated with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 9</cross-reference>, the substrate is rotated to a pre-determined angle <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. Once rotated, an oxide is deposited along the angled surface of the substrate in order to close or reform the one or more access holes <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. As such, the closing of the one or more access holes in order to encapsulate the micro-channel is depicted with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, an additional method <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> is illustrated for forming a periodic array of access windows <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> within the oxide layer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, for example, as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A, 2B</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. At process block <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight>, access window dimensions are determined for the periodic array of access windows <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, an aspect ratio of the access windows are generally larger than or equal to one, such that the width <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> of the oxide layer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> equals a length <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> of the access window <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, as depicted with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>. As such, the oxide layer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> width <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is generally equal to the access window length <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> resulting in an aspect ratio of one. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> However, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications of the access hole/window configurations, such as the hole/window length <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and the oxide layer width <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, may be modified without departing from the scope of the present invention, as depicted in FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Once dimensions for the periodic array of access windows <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> are determined, process block <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight> is performed. At process block <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight>, channel dimensions of the one or more micro-channels are determined. Accordingly, the periodic array of access windows <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> are formed along the channel dimensions of the one or more desired micro-channels. Once the channel dimensions are determined, process block <highlight><bold>616</bold></highlight> is performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> At process block <highlight><bold>616</bold></highlight>, the oxide layer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is anisotropically etched to form the periodic array of access holes <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> along the channel dimensions of the one or more desired micro-channels. In one embodiment, direct-write focused ion-beam milling is used to anisotropically etch the thin film layer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in order to form access holes <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, by forming the periodic array of access windows <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> along the channel dimensions of the one or more micro-channels, etching the underlying area of the substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is facilitated by using a laser chemical etcher for rapid prototyping of one or more micro-channel along the desired dimensions of the one or more micro-channels. Consequently, one or more micro-channels <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> are therefore readily formed within the underlying area of the substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, as depicted with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>

At process block <highlight><bold>634</bold></highlight>, an angle for rotation of the substrate OR <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is determined in order to close the access holes <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the pre-determined angle &thgr;<highlight><subscript>R </subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is, for example 45&deg;. However, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various rotation angles may be utilized within the scope and teachings of the present invention based on the desired closure of the access holes <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> At process block <highlight><bold>636</bold></highlight>, the substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, including the oxide layer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, is rotated to the pre-determined angle <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> calculated at process block <highlight><bold>634</bold></highlight>. Following rotation of the substrate to the pre-determined angle <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, process block <highlight><bold>638</bold></highlight> is performed. At process block <highlight><bold>638</bold></highlight>, a sputter deposition of oxide is performed along an angled surface of the oxide layer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to close the array of access windows <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> using a partial oxide layer <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, as depicted with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. In one embodiment, the sputter deposition of the partial oxide layer <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> is performed using a physical vapor deposition source. In an alternative embodiment, a sputter deposition of silicon nitride is performed along an angled surface of the nitride layer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to close the array of access holes <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> using a partial silicon nitride layer <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, as depicted with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Once the periodic array of access holes are closed in order to encapsulate the one or more micro-channels <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, process block <highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight> is performed. At process block <highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight>, the oxide layer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is planarized. In one embodiment, a surface of the oxide layer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can be coated with a conformal layer of dielectric, which can planarize the surface. The dielectric is, for example, one of an oxide nitride or some silicon-based polymer. In an alternative embodiment, a chemical-mechanical polishing step can planarize the surface of the oxide layer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Several aspects of one implementation of a method for fabricating encapsulated micro-channels in a substrate using a periodic array of access holes or windows have been described. However, various implementations of the method utilizing various configurations of access hole dimensions for fabricating encapsulated micro-channels in a substrate for rapid prototyping of MEMS device and bio-MEMS application provide numerous features including, complementing, supplementing, and/or replacing the features described above. Features can be implemented as part of an RF, micro-fluidic, micro-system or as integrated circuits in different implementations. In addition, the foregoing description, for purposes of explanation, used specific nomenclature to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. However, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that the specific details are not required in order to practice the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In addition, although an embodiment described herein is directed to a MEMS device utilizing fabricated, encapsulated micro-channels, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the teaching of the present invention can be applied to other systems. In fact, systems for MEMS device utilizing fabricated encapsulated micro-channels are within the teachings of the present invention, without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention. The embodiments described above were chosen and described in order to best explain the principles of the invention and its practical applications. These embodiment were chosen to thereby enable others skilled in the art to best utilize the invention and various embodiments with various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> It is to be understood that even though numerous characteristics and advantages of various embodiments of the present invention have been set forth in the foregoing description, together with details of the structure and function of various embodiments of the invention, this disclosure is illustrative only. In some cases, certain subassemblies are only described in detail with one such embodiment. Nevertheless, it is recognized and intended that such subassemblies may be used in other embodiments of the invention. Changes may be made in detail, especially matters of structure and management of parts within the principles of the present invention to the full extent indicated by the broad general meaning of the terms in which the appended claims are expressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides many advantages over known techniques. The present invention includes the ability for fabrication of fully encapsulated micro-channels of arbitrary lengths and widths on the surface of a silicon substrate (and potentially other substrates) using existing direct-write etching tools. The use of direct-write etching tools allows for the possibility of developing rapid prototyping for micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) with specific application to micro-fluidic systems and RF micro-systems. In addition, the process taught by the present invention is low temperature and compatible with current low temperature packing technology, making the possibility for prototyping thermal management systems/networks on the back side of current integrated circuit products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> As such, when combined with the circuit edit technologies, MEMS structures can be rapidly constructed without the cost and time required for conventional pointer processing. Likewise, the present invention may be implemented for debug and prepare previously constructed Microsystems analogous to microsurgery used during first silicon debug. The technology of encapsulated micro-channels could be used with other techniques to affect or pair as an improved performance of existing micro-system designs without the need to create new masks and process wafers from scratch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In addition, potential engineering change orders (ECO) to the micro-system&apos;s design could be verified in advance to significantly improve the success rate of design changes. Furthermore, the low temperature process is compatible with microprocessor packaging technology. Consequently, micro-fluidic channels and their structures can also be prototyped on the back side of a silicon substrate of a production product in close proximity to active transistor layers for the purpose of heat management (directing heat away from active device areas). </paragraph>
