<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to building construction facing materials and more particularly to a concrete and plastic construction panel. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Concrete is a good building material, being long-lasting, moldable, water proof, fire proof, termite proof and vermin proof, and having high compressive strength. Concrete has, however, a high weight factor and relatively low tensile strength. Solid concrete panels are generally too heavy for many building panel applications, as for example, counter tops, shower enclosures, exterior facing panels, window sills and table tops. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Composite panels, having a facing layer of concrete and a support layer made of another material, can be lighter, cost less than a solid concrete panel, have better thermal and sound insulating properties, and possess all of the advantages of concrete and the support layer material. Prior known composite panels have a front facing layer of concrete, and a support layer that is adhesively attached to the facing layer after the facing layer has hardened. The adhesive adds to the cost of the panel, and the separate curing times for the concrete and the adhesive add to the manufacturing time of the panels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Composite panels having a front facing layer of concrete, and a support layer that is adhesively attached to the facing layer do not have mechanical attachment between the facing layer and the support layer. Differential thermal expansion and contraction can degrade the adhesive bond between the layers and thereby reduce the reliability of these composite panels. U.S. Pat. No. Re. 20,607 to Tomec discloses a composite panel with a multilayer base member and a surface layer of a flowable material such as cement. The base member is adhesively bonded or stapled together and has an outer layer with apertures, an intermediate layer with apertures that are offset or larger than the apertures in the outer layer, and a solid inner layer. The material of the surface layer flows around the apertures in the outer layer of the base member to interlock with the outer layer. The attachment between the layers of the base member does not interlock. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A composite panel having a concrete or cement mixture facing layer and a plastic support layer is disclosed. The support layer includes a planar outer surface, a spaced inner surface and a plurality of spaced cavities opening through the outer surface. The cavities enlarge from the outer surface into the support layer so that an overhanging edge portion is formed between each cavity and the outer surface. The facing layer is formed on the first surface and extends into the cavities. The facing layer and the overhanging edge portions of the support layer overlap and interlock to provide a durable mechanical attachment of the facing layer to the support layer.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 2</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a composite panel <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> embodying features of the present invention is shown, including a support layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and a facing layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated embodiment the panel <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> by way of example, and not as a limitation, as a countertop that includes a sink aperture <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> for receiving a sink and a formed front side <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The support layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is a rigid, one piece layer having a generally planar outer surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and a spaced inner surface <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The support layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is a honeycomb structure including a plurality of spaced cavities <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in the form of outer depressions <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> that open through openings <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the outer surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Preferably the cavities are uniformly spaced to form a uniform pattern in the support layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Each outer depression <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is defined by a outer depression surface <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> that connects to the outer surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> at the openings <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The outer depressions <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> widen or enlarge from the openings <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> into the support layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to form overhanging edge portions <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiment, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, the outer depressions <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> have the shape of a truncated sphere greater than a hemisphere so that the outer depression surfaces <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> connect along the openings <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to the outer surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> at an acute angle. Other shapes for the outer depressions <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, such as ellipsoid or ovoid, may be used and the outer depression surfaces <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> may connect to the outer surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> with a straight or curved surface between, as long as an overhanging edge portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is formed around a portion on the openings <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. A plurality of spaced inner depressions <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> extend into the support layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> closely interspersed or staggered between the outer depressions <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and open through the inner surface <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The inner depressions <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> preferably also have overhanging edge portions <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> connecting to the inner surface <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The closely staggered outer depressions <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and inner depressions <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> shown each extend through most of the support layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> from opposite sides and significantly reduce the weight of the support layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The facing layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed on the outer surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the support layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and has an inner face <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> on the outer surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the support layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and a spaced, oppositely facing outer face <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The facing layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed with extending portions <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> that extend from the inner face <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> through the openings <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and into the outer depressions <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of the support layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The extending portions <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> form around and overlap the overhanging edge portions <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the support layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to mechanically interlock and mechanically attach or affix the facing layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with the support layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to form a rigid, bonded, integral, unitary panel body without requiring an adhesive. The extending portions <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> extend into the outer depressions <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> preferably only a small portion of the depth of the outer depressions <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows one alternative configuration for the outer depressions <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and the inner depressions <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of the support layer, with the outer depressions <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and the inner depressions <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> each having a generally rectilinear polygonal shape with curved corners <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The outer depressions <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and the inner depressions <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> do not need to be of the same shape and other shapes may be used for either the outer depressions <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> or the inner depressions <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> as long as the overhanging edge portions <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are formed between the outer surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the support layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the outer depressions <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. As shown is <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the spaced cavities <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may alternatively be in the form of apertures <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> that extend through the support layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> from the outer surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to the inner surface <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The apertures <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> enlarge into the support layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> from the outer surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to form overhanging edge portions <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The illustrated apertures <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> have a cross sectional shape, in a plane perpendicular to the outer surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, of a hexagon with openings <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the outer surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the inner surface <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> forming opposing sides, and the hexagon sides connected to the openings <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> diverging therefrom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The support layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is preferably of a thermoplastic material that is lightweight as compared to concrete and is rigid. By way of example, and not as a limitation, the cavities <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in the form of the outer depressions <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> or the apertures <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, and inner depressions <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> can be formed in a thermoplastic material by either heating the material to near the melting temperature and directing pressurized gas into the material at selected locations on the outer surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the inner surface <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, or by directing pressurized gas that is heated above the softening temperature of the material into the material at selected locations. The cavities <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in the form of the outer depressions <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> or the apertures <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, and inner depressions <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> may have any cross sectional shape in any plane parallel to the outer surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, but are most easily formed with a round or oval shape with the above methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The facing layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is made of a cement mixture. Preferably the cement mixture includes a plasticizer. The facing layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed on the support layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by first pouring the cement mixture of the facing layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> into a mold and then placing the support layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> into the cement mixture, with the outer surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the support layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> facing towards the cement mixture, while the cement mixture is liquid. The cement mixture flows into the cavities <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and around the overhanging edge portions <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The air trapped in the outer depressions <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, in the support layers shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, limits the amount of cement mixture that enters the outer depressions <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> so that the cavities <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are only partially filled. Preferably the support layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> with the apertures <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is placed a limited distance into the cement mixture so that the cavities <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are only partially filled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The mold may be designed and the cement mixture may be mixed so that the outer face <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the facing layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> simulates stone, tile or other materials. Preferably the outer face <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> simulates decorative stone with a polished surface finish. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> the sides <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the panel <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be formed into any desired shape. The facing layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is preferably at least 3 mm thick, excluding the extending portions <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. The support layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is preferably at least three times the thickness of the facing layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> excluding the extending portions <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The composite panel <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention is suitable, by way of example, and not as a limitation, for use in counter tops, table tops, shower enclosures, window sills and exterior facing panels. The interlocking of the overhanging edge portions <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the support layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the extending portions <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> of the facing layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> assures a reliable connection between all of the layers of the panel <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, even where the panel <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is exposed to high temperature gradients. The inner depressions <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> provide for reliable attachment of the panel <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to a wall. The honeycomb plastic support layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> provides a panel <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with significantly higher tensile strength than a solid concrete panel. The cavities <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and inner depressions <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> together reduce the cross sectional area, in any plane parallel to the outer surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, of the support layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The reduced cross sectional area reduces heat and sound transfer, improving the thermal and sound insulating properties of the panel <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The partial filling of the cavities in combination with the reduced cross sectional significantly reduces the weight of the panel <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> relative to a solid concrete panel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Although the present invention has been described with a certain degree of particularity, it is understood that the present disclosure has been made by way of example and that changes in details of structure may be made without departing from the spirit thereof. </paragraph>
