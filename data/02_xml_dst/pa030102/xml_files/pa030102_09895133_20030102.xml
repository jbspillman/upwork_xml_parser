<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A method and apparatus for a UWB radio utilizing MEMS filtering is described. The method described includes receiving a pulse signal from a transmission station. Once received, a delay line including one or more taps is driven with the pulse signal. Once the pulse signal exits the delay line, the delay line is sampled at each of the taps to determine a time delay and amplitude of each echo in the pulse signal. These steps are repeated for each pulse signal received until a delay/amplitude map of the transmission channel between the stations is complete. Using the echo map, a time delay and amplitude of each echo indicated by the map is determined synthetic and recursive anti-echoes.

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to micro electromechanical structures. In particular, the present invention relates to an apparatus and method for an ultra-wideband radio utilizing MEMS filtering. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A wireless, local area network (LAN) is a flexible data communications system that can either replace or extend a wired LAN to provide additional functionality. Using radio frequency (RF) technology, wireless-LANs transmit and receive data over the air, through walls, ceilings and even cement structures, without wired cabling. A wireless-LAN provides all the features and benefits of traditional LAN technologies, such as Ethernet and Token Ring, but without the limitation of being tethered to a cable. This provides greater freedom and increased flexibility. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In other words, a Wireless-LAN is a network in which a mobile user can connect to a local area network (LAN) through a wireless (radio) connection. A standard from the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) 802.11B-1999, published Sep. 16, 1999 specifies the technologies for wireless-LANs. Accordingly, high bandwidth allocation for wireless-LANs will enable, at a relatively low cost, wiring of various buildings, such as classrooms, in the United States. One technique for providing high bandwidth allocation in a wireless-LAN is provided via ultra wide bandwidth (UWB) radio systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> UWB radio systems employ the transmission of very short pulses of radio energy. These characteristic spectrum signatures extend across a wide range of radio frequencies. In addition, since UWB signals have high bandwidth and frequency diversity, UWB signals are particularly suited for high speed data communications in environments, such as indoors, where multi-path fading is likely. Consequently, UWB radio systems are generally well-suited for implementing a wireless-LAN. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the radio spectrum utilized by wireless communication is considered to be fully utilized and, in fact, in short supply. In contrast, UWB signals, by their very nature, utilize spectrum already designed for other use and regulated by the Federal Communications Commission. Unlike continuous wave technologies that use sine waves to encode information, UWB technologies encode large amounts of information over short distances, using brief, extremely low power bursts or pulses of radio energy spread across a wide range of frequencies. As indicated above, one of the most appealing characteristics of UWB technology is its place in the frequency spectrum, a characteristic directly associated with low power consumption and interference immunity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, by transmitting data at a very low power, UWB devices are able to use spectrum already occupied by radio devices. This characteristic enables UWB technology to recycle spectrum, a characteristic of great value in a time when spectrum, a scarce resource, is in high technological demand. Unfortunately, wireless-LANs utilizing UWB radio signals may suffer from echoes due to multi-path fading. This problem becomes particularly serious when considering that a wireless-LAN must transmit signals and receive data over the air through walls, ceilings and even cement structures, without wired cable. As a result, transmission through such structures may cause echoes as the transmitted signals bounce off the walls. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Therefore, there remains a need to overcome one or more of the limitations in the above-described, existing art. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> A method and apparatus for an ultra-wideband radio utilizing MEMS filtering are described. The method described includes receiving a pulse signal from a communicating transmission station. Once received, a delay line including one or more taps is driven with the received pulse signal. Once the received pulse signal exits the delay line, the delay line is sampled at each of the one or more taps to determine a time delay and amplitude of each echo in the received pulse signal. These steps are repeated for each received pulse signal from the communicating transmission station until the delay/amplitude map of the channel between the transmission station and the receiving station is complete. Once completed, the delay/amplitude map may be transmitted to the transmission station or utilized to remove channel echoes from input transmission signals received by the receiving station. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The method further includes the receipt of a delay/amplitude map of a channel. Using the delay/amplitude map, a time delay and amplitude of each echo indicated by the map is determined. Once each echo is determined, a synthetic anti-echo is generated, having the same time delay as the respective echo, but an inverse amplitude of the echo in order to cancel out any echoes over the channel. In addition, recursive echoes are also generated to remove echoes caused by the generated synthetic echoes. As such, when transmitting or receiving a signal over the channel, the synthetic echoes and recursive echoes are combined with the signal in order to eliminate all channel echoes in a received signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without some of these specific details. For example, the various transceiver configurations and circuits may be modified according to the teachings of the present invention. In addition, the following description provides examples, and the accompanying drawings show various examples for the purposes of illustration. However, these examples should not be construed in a limiting sense as they are merely intended to provide examples of the present invention rather than to provide an exhaustive list of all possible implementations of the present invention. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring the details of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> System Architecture </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> As described above, ultra wide bandwidth (UWB) radio systems send out very sharp pulses that intrinsically have a very wide spectral content. In contrast, traditional continuous wave radio systems transmit and receive spectrally controlled trains of sine waves. Accordingly, tuning and modulation of the UWB signals takes place in the time amplitude domain. As a result, UWB signals exhibit low power for a given signal to noise ratio, which leads to compatible interoperatability with existing radio services. In addition, UWB radio signals have the ability to remove multi-path effects by pulse shaping and timing discrimination techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> timing diagram <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is illustrated depicting a transmitter <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and a receiver <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> also depicts a graph <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of electrical fields versus time. Accordingly, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows how UWB radio transmits data between a transmitter <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and a receiver <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. As described above, the pulses are very sharp in time, implying a very wide bandwidth infrequency. As such, modulation is achieved by either amplitude modulation or by time position variation. Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, detection of data occurs by sampling data at one or more time slots <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. During time slots &lsquo;1&rsquo; (<highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>) and time slot &lsquo;3&rsquo; (<highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>) sampling of a transmission channel yields the detection of a pulse, or digital 1&prime;. The absence of a pulse at time slot &lsquo;2&rsquo; (<highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>) indicates a digital &lsquo;0&rsquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> block diagram is depicted which illustrates a micro-electrical mechanical system delay line <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. As known to those skilled in the art, micro-electrical mechanical systems (MEMS) are precisely etched silicon devices that have mechanical, as well as electrical, components. At current levels of lithography, MEMS filters and delay lines can support signals of up to 10 gigahertz (GHZ). For a multi-tap delay line, the speed of sound is some tens of kilometers per second (typical for solids), thus implying that a one millimeter long delay line can control signal delays of 0.1 microseconds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Moreover, metal taps can have spacing pitches of approximately 0.2 micrometers, which implies that the inter tap &Dgr; delay times for delay line using metal taps can be as small as approximately 20 pico seconds. Multiplying these times by the speed of light implies that a MEMS delay line can control multi-path differential lengths from 6&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;4 </superscript></highlight>meters up to 30 meters. This considerable dynamic range can, in principle, compensate for all echoes in a wireless-local area network, for example as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</cross-reference>. Accordingly, by utilizing an ultra-wide bandwidth radio system transceiver, which includes a MEMS based delay line having multiple taps, base band (full bandwidth) echo compensation is possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the MEMS based delay line <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> consists of mechanical arms <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, . . . , <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>-N) tied to a central spine <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. Rocking motion will be transmitted by electro-static forces down the chain of rocking arms <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. Rocking motion can be initiated by an electrostatic forces applied to the first rocker <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and delayed samples of the input signal can be detected by capacitive pick-ups (not shown) which are attached to taps underneath successive rocker arms <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the delay line may initially be driven by a data signal. Once driven, taps beneath the successive rocker arms can be sampled to determine if any additional signal noise or echoes are received along with the received data signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the mechanical arms are non-uniformly spaced in order to simplify design and provide coarser sampling for longer echo delays, as described in further detail below. In other words, echoes that occur close in time to a pulse signal require precise time calculation. In contrast, echoes that occur further away from the incident pulse signal will spread out in time and require coarse time cancellation. Likewise, a time delay from receipt of the initial signal as well as an amplitude of each echo is determined by sampling the taps of the MEMS delay line <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</cross-reference>, a local area wireless network is depicted, which utilizes transceiver stations implemented using UWB radio. Referring now to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A, a peer-to-peer wireless local area network configuration <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is depicted. In a peer-to-peer configuration, two or more personal computers (PCs) <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . , <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>-N) equipped with, for example wireless adapter cards, form a local area network which enables communication between each of the PCs <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and a server computer <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. The peer-to-peer configuration <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is principally used to quickly and easily set up a wireless local area network where no infrastructure is available, such as a convention center or offsite meeting location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B, a</cross-reference> client server wireless configuration <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> is illustrated. In the client server wireless configuration <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>B, the PC computers <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> each include, for example, wireless adapter cards which enable communication with a wireless-LAN access point <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight>. As such, the PCs <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> are linked to a central hub, or LAN access point <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight>, that acts as a bridge to resources of a wired network <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight>. Unfortunately, regardless of the configuration used, wireless local area networks will suffer from noise due to interference from signals as they travel along and are affected by the environment, resulting in signal noise or channel echoes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, current wireless-local area network systems will suffer from channel echoes, for example as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A, a</cross-reference> direct pulse <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is illustrated, which includes several inverted echoes <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, . . . , <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>-N) and non-inverted echoes <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, . . . , <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>-N) (echo <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>). In accordance with the teachings of the present invention, a multi-tap MEMS delay line may be used to sample each of the echoes <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> in the transmission channel in order to generate synthetic anti-echoes <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, . . . , <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight>-N) and <highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, . . . , <highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight>-N), as depicted in the signal amplitude versus time graph <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference>. Accordingly, once each synthetic anti-echo <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight> is broadcast, along with a data signal <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> through the transmission channel, the synthetic anti-echoes <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight> will cancel out any echoes <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> caused by the data signal <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Consequently, utilizing a MEMS based delay line <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> transceiver can receive continuous pulses from a communicating station and generate a delay/amplitude map of the transmission channel between the two stations. Using this echo map, the receiving station can either generate synthetic anti-echoes for its received input signals to remove channel echoes (post-compensation) or transmits the map to the communicating transmission station such that the transmission station may pre-distort its transmission signals based on the received delay/amplitude map (pre-compensation mode). As referred to herein, the term &ldquo;channel calibration&rdquo; refers to the post-compensation or pre-compensation of data signals in order to remove channel echoes from received signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> transceiver <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is depicted which utilizes a multi-tap MEMS based delay line in order to detect channel echoes over a transmission channel. As described above, the MEMS based delay line may utilize non-uniformly spaced taps to provide coarser sampling for longer echo delays. In addition, the transceiver also pre-distorts data signal transmissions over the transmission channel such that echoes are removed from a received data signal. The transceiver <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>, as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is utilized, for example in the wireless-LANs as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</cross-reference>, such that the transceiver may be encompassed in an adapter card of the various PCs <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the transceiver <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> includes a processor <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> having circuitry to execute instructions. A communications interface <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> is coupled to the processor <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> and collectively includes a first MEMS based delay line <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>, a delay/amplitude echo map block <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight>, a second MEMS delay line <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>, a plurality of programmable amplifiers <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight>, a power amplifier <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight> and an antenna <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the transceiver <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> utilizes a first MEMS based delay line <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> and a delay/amplitude echo map block <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> in order to sample a pulse signal received from a communicating transmission station (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, the MEMS based delay line <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> may include one or more taps <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, . . . , <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight>-N). Utilizing the various taps of the MEMS based delay line <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>, the delay/amplitude block <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> samples each of the one or more taps in order to determine whether channel echoes are received along with the pulse signal. When an echo is detected, based on a tap <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> of the MEMS based delay line <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>, the echo map block <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> determines the delay of the echo echo and an amplitude of each echo. This process is repeated until the echo map block creates a delay/amplitude echo of the transmission channel. However, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the transceiver <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is depicted with a first and second MEMS delay line <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> for illustration purposes only, such that a specific implementation may multiplex a single MEMS based delay line for both the transmit and receive functions of the transceiver <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Once completed, the delay/amplitude echo map is stored in a storage device <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>. In addition, the transceiver <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> may transmit the echo map to a receiver station using a back channel <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>. The delay/amplitude echo map is then received by a communicating transmission station, which is providing the pulse signals <highlight><bold>536</bold></highlight> to the transceiver <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. The communicating transmission station continuously transmits a pulse signal <highlight><bold>536</bold></highlight> to the transceiver <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>, for example once every millisecond. This process is repeated until the communicating transmission station receives a delay/amplitude echo map from the transceiver <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Once received, the transceiver <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> will begin transmitting pulse signals <highlight><bold>562</bold></highlight> to the communicating transmission station, such that a delay/amplitude echo map of a reverse transmission channel between the two stations can be completed. Once completed, the delay/amplitude echo map of the reverse channel will be transmitted via the back channel <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> to the transceiver <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. Once received, the transceiver <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> may utilize an echo structure of the echo map in order to pre-distort data signal transmissions over the transmission channel. This process is performed by the MEMS delay line <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, during signal transmission, the transceiver chipset <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight> will transmit a data signal <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight>, which is provided to the modulator <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>. The modulator <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> will modulate the signal <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight> and provide the data signal <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight> to the MEMS based delay line <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>. Utilizing the delay/amplitude echo map of the transmission channel, the processor <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> will attach a programmable amplifier <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, . . . , <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight>-N) to a respective tap <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, . . . , <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight>-N) of the MEMS based delay line corresponding with a delay of a detected echo. The echo will then be sampled and amplified by an amplifier <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight> with an inverse amplitude of the detected echo. As such, the various amplifiers will generate synthetic anti-echoes for each of the echoes detected in the echo map. The various synthetic anti-echoes are then received by the power amp <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight> and summed together with the data signal <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight> and transmitted over the transmission channel via the antenna <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> However, the synthetic anti-echoes will also generate echoes. Consequently, the processor will also determine recursive anti-echoes and attach additional programmable amplifiers <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight> to taps <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight> which capture the recursive anti-echoes. Consequently, the synthetic anti-echoes along with the recursive anti-echoes will be summed together with the data signal <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight> and transmitted over the transmission channel via antenna <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight>. As such, the synthetic anti-echoes and recursive anti-echoes will cancel out with any echoes within the transmission channel, resulting in a virtually echo-free data signal, which is received by a receiving station. In one embodiment, calculation of the recursive anti-echoes is repeated until a signal noise floor or residual echo spectrum of the transmission channel is below a predetermined level such as &minus;10 decibels (db). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The embodiment of the transceiver <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates a pre-compensation mode wherein data signals are pre-distorted prior to transmission over the channel. However, post-compensation of received data signals may also be performed, as illustrated by the transceiver <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. However, those skilled in the art will appreciate that a combination pre-compensation/post-compensation transceiver is within the contemplation of the present invention. The transceiver <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is more or less identical to the transceiver depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> with the exception that the transceiver <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> does not include a back channel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the transceiver <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> contains the requisite circuitry to generate a delay/amplitude echo map based on received pulse signals from a communicating transmission station. However, once the echo map is formed, the echo map is stored, for example, in the storage device <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>, and utilized by the MEMS delay line <highlight><bold>650</bold></highlight> in order to cancel out echoes in received data signals <highlight><bold>638</bold></highlight>. As such, a data signal <highlight><bold>638</bold></highlight> received via antenna <highlight><bold>634</bold></highlight> is provided to the MEMS delay line <highlight><bold>650</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> However, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the transceiver <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> is depicted with a first and second MEMS delay line <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>650</bold></highlight> for illustration purposes only, such that a specific implementation may multiplex a single MEMS based delay line for both the transmit and receive functions of the transceiver <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the processor <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> in accordance with the delay/amplitude echo map of the transmission channel will determine one or more taps <highlight><bold>652</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>652</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, . . . , <highlight><bold>652</bold></highlight>-N) which capture an echo based on the stored echo map. As such, an amplifier <highlight><bold>654</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>654</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, . . . , <highlight><bold>654</bold></highlight>-N) will be attached to each of the taps <highlight><bold>652</bold></highlight> determined by the processor <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the mechanical arms are non-uniformly spaced in order to simplify design and provide coarser sampling for longer echo delays, as described in further detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Consequently, the amplifiers <highlight><bold>654</bold></highlight> will capture the various echoes and generate the synthetic anti-echo by reversing the polarity or amplitude of the echo. As such, the programmable amplifier <highlight><bold>652</bold></highlight> will generate a synthetic anti-echo <highlight><bold>658</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>658</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, . . . , <highlight><bold>658</bold></highlight>-N) for each echo indicated by the delay/amplitude echo map of the respective transmission channels. Consequently, a summing amplifier <highlight><bold>660</bold></highlight> will sum each of the synthetic anti-echoes <highlight><bold>658</bold></highlight>, along with the received data signal <highlight><bold>638</bold></highlight>, which will result in a cancellation of each of the echoes contained in the received data signal <highlight><bold>638</bold></highlight>. Procedural methods of implementing the teachings of the present invention are now described. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> depicts a block diagram illustrating a method for calibrating transmission channels within a wireless-LAN, for example as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</cross-reference>, utilizing transceivers which communicate utilizing ultra wide bandwidth (UWB) radio signals. As described above, the term &ldquo;channel calibration&rdquo; refers to the post-compensation or pre-compensation of data signals in order to remove channel echoes from received signals. At process block <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>, channel calibration is established between a communicating pair of stations, for example, <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, within a wireless network <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>. At process block <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight>, it is determined whether an additional pair of stations, for example <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>-N, require channel calibration for a transmission channel <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> therebetween. As such, channel calibration is repeated for each transmission channel <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, . . . , <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>-N) within the wireless-LAN network <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Once channel calibration is complete, process block <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight> is performed. At process block <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight>, it is determined whether a station <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, or PC, is receiving data. When data is being received, control flow branches to control block A, otherwise, process block <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> is performed. At process block <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight>, it is determined whether a station <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is transmitting data. When a station is transmitting data, process block B is performed, otherwise, process block <highlight><bold>840</bold></highlight> is performed. At process block <highlight><bold>840</bold></highlight>, process blocks <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> are repeated until the wireless-LAN is shut down. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, illustrate an additional method for establishing channel calibration between a pair of communicating stations (e.g., <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), as illustrated at process block <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> of the method <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. Accordingly, at process block <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> of the method <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9, a</cross-reference> communicating transmission station <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> will transmit a pulse signal over a transmission channel between the transmitting station <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a communicating receiving station <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. At process block <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> of the method <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the receiving station will receive a pulse signal over the transmission channel <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> from the communicating transmission station <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Once received, at process block <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight>, the receiving station <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> will drive a MEMS based delay line, including one or more taps, with the received pulse signal. In one embodiment, the MEMS delay line is designed with closely spaced taps at a start of the delay line in order to capture echoes within close proximity to the incident pulse requiring precise time calculations for cancellation. In this embodiment, the taps are gradually further spaced apart towards an end of the delay line in order to capture echoes, which occur further away from the incident pulse and therefore do not require precise time calculations for cancellation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> At process block <highlight><bold>714</bold></highlight>, the receiving station will sample each of the one or more taps of the delay line to determine a time delay and amplitude of each echo detected in the received pulse signal.

Once the echo map is complete, process block <highlight><bold>724</bold></highlight> is performed. At process block <highlight><bold>724</bold></highlight>, it is determined whether the receiving station is in pre-compensation mode. </paragraph>

However, if the transmission station <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is in post-compensation mode, the transmission station <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> will transmit a pulse signal to the receiving station <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> until the receiving station <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has completed the echo map. As such, process block <highlight><bold>732</bold></highlight> is performed. Otherwise, once the delay/amplitude echo map is received at process block <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight>, process block <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight> is performed. At process block <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight>, the transmitting station <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> will store the received delay/amplitude echo map for transmission channel <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

At process block <highlight><bold>764</bold></highlight>, it is determined whether the receiving station <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is in pre-compensation mode (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). When the receiving station is in pre-compensation mode, process block <highlight><bold>770</bold></highlight> is performed. At process block <highlight><bold>770</bold></highlight>, received data <highlight><bold>638</bold></highlight> has been pre-distorted by the transmitting station and therefore, the received data signal should be free of channel echoes and is therefore stored. Otherwise, process block <highlight><bold>756</bold></highlight> is performed. At process block <highlight><bold>756</bold></highlight>, the receiving station <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> will remove channel echoes from the received data signal using a stored delay/amplitude echo map <highlight><bold>642</bold></highlight> of the respective transmission channel <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 6</cross-reference>). Once channel echoes are removed from the received data signal <highlight><bold>638</bold></highlight>, the post-compensated data signal <highlight><bold>662</bold></highlight> is stored at process block <highlight><bold>770</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, an additional method <highlight><bold>760</bold></highlight> for removing channel echoes from a received data signal (post-compensation mode) is depicted, for example, in the transceiver <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>.

Consequently, at process block <highlight><bold>830</bold></highlight>, the transceiver <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> transmits a data signal over the transmission channel <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the receiving station <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Finally, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> illustrates an additional method <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> for performing pre-distortion of data signals (pre-compensation mode) within a transceiver such as the transceiver <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. At process block <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight>, the transceiver will select a stored delay/amplitude echo map <highlight><bold>542</bold></highlight> of a transmission channel <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> between the transceiver <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> and a receiving station <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. At process block <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight>, the transceiver <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> will determine a time delay and amplitude for each echo indicated by an echo structure of the selected delay/amplitude echo map <highlight><bold>542</bold></highlight>. However, due to the fact that synthetic anti-echoes will also result in echoes when transmitted over the transmission channel <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the transceiver <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> must generate recursive anti-echoes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> As such, at process block <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight>, the transceiver <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> will generate recursive anti-echoes for each echo caused by a synthetic anti-echo. At process block <highlight><bold>818</bold></highlight>, process block <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight> is repeated until a residual echo spectrum of the transmission channel is within a pre-determined threshold, such as for example, &minus;10 db. Once this is the case, process block <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight> is performed. At process block <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight>, the synthetic anti-echoes and the recursive anti-echoes <highlight><bold>558</bold></highlight> are combined with the data signal <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight> using the power amp <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight>. Consequently, once the data signal and synthetic anti-echoes and recursive anti-echoes are broadcast over the transmission channel <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the synthetic and recursive anti-echoes will cancel out any echoes caused by the data signal when transmitted over the transmission channel <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Several aspects of one implementation of the wireless-LAN utilizing UWB radio signal for providing echo-free received data signals and removing echoes from received data signals have been described. However, various implementations of the wireless-LAN provide numerous features including, complementing, supplementing, and/or replacing the features described above. Features can be implemented as part of a wireless adapter card for PC or as part of transceiver stations in different implementations, as well as combination pre-compensation/post-compensation transceivers. In addition, the foregoing description, for purposes of explanation, used specific nomenclature to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. However, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that the specific details are not required in order to practice the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In addition, although an embodiment described herein is directed to a wireless-LAN, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the teaching of the present invention can be applied to other systems. In fact, systems for wireless communication utilizing UWB signals are within the teachings of the present invention, without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention. The embodiments described above were chosen and described in order to best explain the principles of the invention and its practical applications. These embodiment were chosen to thereby enable others skilled in the art to best utilize the invention and various embodiments with various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> It is to be understood that even though numerous characteristics and advantages of various embodiments of the present invention have been set forth in the foregoing description, together with details of the structure and function of various embodiments of the invention, this disclosure is illustrative only. In some cases, certain subassemblies are only described in detail with one such embodiment. Nevertheless, it is recognized and intended that such subassemblies may be used in other embodiments of the invention. Changes may be made in detail, especially matters of structure and management of parts within the principles of the present invention to the full extent indicated by the broad general meaning of the terms in which the appended claims are expressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides many advantages over known techniques. The present invention includes the ability to provide wireless-LAN networks with virtually echo-free signal transmission. Accordingly, high bandwidth allocation for wireless-LANs will enable, at a relatively low cost, wiring of various buildings, such as classrooms, in the United States. Such high bandwidth allocation is provided by UWB radio signals, which have the ability to remove multi-path effects by pulse shaping and timing discrimination techniques. Accordingly, virtually echo-free wireless-LANs are provided by the present invention by combining UWB radio signals with MEMS based delay-lines in order to remove channel echoes from received data signals. </paragraph>
