<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> personal object <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, shown here by example as a cane or walking stick, is any object that a person, by habit or necessity, finds indispensable and, consequently, keeps constantly on their person or within easy reach. Another feature of at least some personal objects is that they are in contact with the person regularly, so that a biosensor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> integrated into them may regularly receive inputs to monitor the health status of the user. Other examples of personal objects were identified in the Summary of the Invention section and include: walkers, wheelchairs, crutches, personal transportation vehicles, watches, key holders, purses, glasses, hearing aids, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The personal object <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, in the example embodiment, has a housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> encasing the electronic components of a digital assistant. Here the housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> forms the handle of the cane. In the present example, a speaker <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and a microphone <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are used to generate a user interface, allowing the user to make use of the assistant by speaking and listening. Additionally and/or in combination with the microphone <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>/speaker <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> interface, the user can command the assistant by operating scroll button <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and/or enter button <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for scrolling through and selecting from recorded menus, and/or entering verbal data. An emergency button <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> may also be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The biosensor module <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be incorporated directly into the portion of housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> so that sensors comes in direct contact with the user&apos;s skin. Alternatively, the sensor may be remote, such as a heart monitor chest strap, and communicate with a component integrated in the housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, or example by a radio frequency or infrared link. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> An accessory port <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> may be provided to interface indirectly or upload or download data and may allow connection to a keyboard, computer, keypad, modem, display, etc. The port <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> may be an infrared, radio wireless, cable-type connector, or any other suitable data channel device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the integrated electronic functions in housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> include a personal digital assistant (PDA) <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. PDA <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> stores and retrieves appointments and may be programmed to store and retrieve addresses and phone numbers, calendar events, and memos, to-do lists, etc. Additionally, PDA <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> functionality may include any other capabilities known to be used in PDA applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> PDA <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be operable without a visual display relying solely, or primarily upon, speech recognition and synthetic speech output, though a display may be made attachable through port <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Speech (or other audio symbology) is output from PDA <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to the user is through speaker <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in the form of synthesized speech or replayed sound samples. Direct user input may be through a microphone <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Speech recognition may be used to enter data such as phone numbers, addresses, memos, appointments, activate functions such as entering commands or parameters, call for help, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Integrated with PDA <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is a cell phone <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Cell phone <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> utilizes microphone <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and speaker <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> for communication with others via cell phone carrier networks. Additionally, dialing functions of numbers stored in the PDA <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may automatically be retrieved and used to program cell phone <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> responsively to voice commands. Of course, dialing of non-stored numbers may also activated by speaking numbers into microphone <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> according to known techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> A navigation function <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> integrates with PDA <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to provide navigation information to the user. A GPS feature of navigation function <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> determines the user&apos;s present position. Cartographic information is stored in PDA <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the user&apos;s present position assessed in relation to addresses, appointments, distances, directions for the best route, travel times, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> For example, say the user lives uptown, has a haircut appointment across town, followed by a doctor&apos;s appointment downtown. The PDA may be programmed to calculate, based on the user&apos;s then-current position, the distance, route, and mode of transportation; then sound a reminder and instructions sufficiently in advance of each appointment time to allow preparation and travel. If the user appears to be headed in the wrong direction, the PDA may generate a local warning signal and if the user remains off track, a remote signal to a helper via the cell network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Integrated with PDA <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, cell phone <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and navigation function <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> within housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is a biosensor module <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Biosensor module <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> includes biosensor (s) <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and/or <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, biosensor communication channel <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, and biosensor information processor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Biosensors <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are those incorporated into housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&apos;s surface and include a skin contact detector <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> to activate biosensing. Biosensors <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are capable of monitoring biological processes measurable on the user&apos;s skin. For example, pulse, temperature, galvanic skin response, vibration, moisture, force, etc. These parameters can be supplied to a classification engine on board the PDA, which may be programmed to combine them and detect danger zones in a parameter space. So, for example, if force and vibration are high, the PDA may be programmed to transmit a remote message to a caretaker indicating that the user is struggling, for example with weakness or palsy. In addition, the biosensor parameter space may be combined with other measurable parameters in such a user-state classification engine to increase the reliability or sensitivity of state detection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Biosensors <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are remote from housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and may constantly monitor relevant biological processes. Biosensors <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>may be capable of monitoring various pathognomonic biological processes. For example, the biosensors <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>may include a halter monitor (attached to the chest) providing the user&apos;s electrocardiogram. The PDA may be programmed to classify risk zones in the parameter space. Remote biosensor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>may also be a surgically implanted device used to monitor blood gas level, blood pH, blood insulin or blood glucose level, histamine level, specific enzyme level, prescription drug concentration, etc. Alternatively a pressure transducer placed appropriately in a cast may monitor stresses placed on the broken limb as the patient progresses toward healing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Biosensor communication channel <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> connects biosensors <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to biosensor information processor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Biosensor communication channel <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> may take the form of any suitable communication channel including a hard-wired connection (preferable in the case of an integral biosensor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) or in the form of an RF or infrared transmitter/receiver set in the case of a remote type biosensor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Biosensor information processor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> receives raw data from biosensor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>or <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, through biosensor communication channel <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, and classifies the user state. Next, the state class is used to generate a useful output such as a call to a caretaker or a message. For example, if the data is to be used in a biofeedback type situation, biosensor information processor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may be programmed to provide a proportional signal to the user through speaker <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. If the state exceeds some threshold, an audio message may be generated, for example: &ldquo;your blood glucose is high, take your insulin now&rdquo;, &ldquo;you are putting too much weight on your leg&rdquo;, &ldquo;your heart rate is exceeding your prescribed limit, please reduce your activity level now&rdquo;, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Biosensor monitoring may also be integrated, along with PDA <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, cell phone <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and navigation function <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, within housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, to emergency alert <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> including emergency button <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Raw data indicating an emergency condition causes biosensor information processor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to activate an emergency alert sequence stored in PDA <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to notify, via cell phone <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, specific individuals or organizations of the emergency situation and request assistance. The user&apos;s location and navigation instructions thereto provided by navigation function <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can also be programmed to be automatically provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Additionally, emergency alert <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may also be activated by the user by simply pressing emergency button <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, whereby the user can either speak directly to the answering party(ies) using cell phone <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> or a predetermined emergency message may be sent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the raw signals received <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> from the biosensors, GPS, inputs, audio input, and any other data sources may be preprocessed <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> and applied to a classification engine <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>. For example, the classification engine may recognize the normal spoken voice of the user and convert the speech into command or verbal symbols for interpretation. It may generate a user state indicator based on an input vector that includes all the raw data input. Unrecognized audio or audio classified as being consistent with struggling or injury may also form part of an input vector and used to classify the user state. The classification engine <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> may operate based on known network techniques such as Bayesian and neural networks. The fit between input vectors and responses may be provided by a weighted factor template as in a Bayesian network (or neural network or other machine-intelligence technique). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The output of classification engine <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> is a user state vector that may be used by a response generator process <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight> running on the PDA or any other controller associated with the intelligent assistant. The response generator receives inputs and sends outputs through a user interface generator process <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight>. A signal generator process <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> may transmit signals through output ports or wireless channels. For example, the signal generator process <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> may generate phone calls with synthetic or recorded speech messages or emit alarm signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> It will be evident to those skilled in the art that the invention is not limited to the details of the foregoing illustrative embodiments, and that the present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or essential attributes thereof. The present embodiments are therefore to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive, the scope of the invention being indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description, and all changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are therefore intended to be embraced therein. </paragraph>
