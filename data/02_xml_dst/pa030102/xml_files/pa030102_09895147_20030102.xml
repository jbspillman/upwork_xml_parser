<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention pertains to fastener installation, and more particularly to installation of lockbolts in assemblies having sealant or adhesive between the parts that must be squeezed out before the lockbolt is secured. </paragraph>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Lockbolts have been used for many years, particularly in the aerospace industry, to fasten together assemblies of parts. A lockbolt is a high strength fastener capable of rapid installation, interference fit, low weight and repeatable installation parameters conducive to quality control documentation. Lockbolts are bolts, usually made of a titanium alloy such as 6AL-4V Titanium, having a head at a headed end and annular grooves adjacent the opposite (tail) end. A grooved &ldquo;pintail&rdquo; at the tail end of the fastener provides a gripping portion by which a lockbolt tool can grip the end of the fastener for applying a pulling force. A lockbolt is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,221,152, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Lockbolts are installed with a tool that pulls the lockbolt to the desired tensile preload and has a swage ring for swaging an aluminum collar onto the annular groves in the fastener tail for securing the fastener after it has been pulled tight. A narrow neck between the grooved tail and the pintail provides a fracture region designed to break at a predetermined force, about flush with the swage collar, allowing speedy removal of the tool to the next fastener location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The lockbolt is a fast and reliable fastening system, but suffers from one disadvantage: after securing the swage collar, the fastener cannot be tightened further, or &ldquo;retorqued&rdquo;, in the parlance of conventional helically threaded bolts and nuts. The grooves in the tail of a lockbolt are annular, not helical. The benefit provided by the annular grooves is that the collar cannot become loose by rotating under the influence of vibration the way a nut can, but if the collar was swaged prematurely, before proper pretension was established, it must be cut off and the lockbolt replaced to obtain a properly pretensioned fastener. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> One circumstance in which the lockbolt swage collar occasionally is secured prematurely is when a viscous fluid sealant or adhesive is used in the interface between the two parts to be fastened together, as when they must produce a fluid-tight seal. One example in which sealant is used is in the wing fuel tanks of a commercial jet airplane for fluid-tight seals to prevent leakage of fuel. When an assembly is fastened together with a viscous fluid such as a sealant or adhesive in the interface, the lockbolt is pulled tight on the assembly, but a finite time is necessary before the viscous fluid can flow out of the interface under the pressure exerted by the pulling force of the fastener. This finite time varies, depending on the flow characteristics of the viscous fluid, the temperature, the spacing between adjacent fasteners, the thickness and stiffness of the part material, the pulling force, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Recognizing that it was necessary to allow time for sealant and adhesive to be squeezed out of the interface, manufacturers of lockbolt equipment in the past have provided an intermediate force which mechanics can apply to the lockbolt, during which the sealant or adhesive could flow out of the interface, before application of the final pulling force ramp-up, leading to swaging the collar and fracture of the pintail. The mechanics were expected to operate the lockbolt installation equipment with a sufficient time delay between application of the intermediate pulling force on the lockbolt and the final ramp-up pulling force on the lockbolt leading to the pintail fracture. That time delay would depend on a number of factors, such as the type of sealant, the temperature, the proximity of the fastener hole to the edge of the part. etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> An experienced mechanic has a remarkably sensitive ability to discern the correct amount of time to allow the sealant to squeeze out of the interface, and high quality assemblies have been consistently produced using the manual approach. However, the commitment of airplane mechanics to produce quality assemblies sometimes resulted in excessive delay times between the intermediate force and the final force ramp-up. Delay times on the order of a two seconds are usually appropriate, but an unusually quality conscientious mechanic would sometimes allow 3 or 4 seconds for sealant squeeze-out, which is more time than necessary. Management was reluctant to admonish such quality conscious mechanics to increase production speed for fear of sending the wrong message about quality vs. production rate, but at the same time management was concerned about excessive production time per operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> As a consequence, the sealed assemblies produced using lockbolts have continued to be made with excellent quality but at a slower than optimal production rate. An enormous number of such fasteners is installed in a large assembly, such as an airplane wing, so those additional few seconds per fastener accumulates into a significant production time increase, and therefore cost increase, for that assembly. Thus, there has long been a need for a lockbolt installation system that automatically shifts from intermediate pressure to full pressure in the optimal time delay for sealant/adhesive to squeeze out of the interface, allowing full fastener preload to be maintained for the fastener. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, this invention provides an improved process for installing lockbolts in assemblies having an interface between two parts in the assembly, with a viscous fluid substance such as an adhesive or sealant in the interface. The invention provides an improved apparatus for installing lockbolts in such assemblies such that an adjustable time delay is provide for exerting a partial fastener preload to allow for fluid squeeze-out before establishing full fastener preload and swaging of the lockbolt collar. The invention produces assemblies fastened at an economical production rate that have fasteners tensioned at the designated preload without relaxation therefrom by fluid squeeze-out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> These features and benefits are attained in a process and apparatus for installation of a lockbolt to fasten together an assembly of at least two parts having a viscous fluid such as adhesive or sealant in the interface between the two parts. A lockbolt is inserted into aligned holes through the two parts and tension is exerted on the lockbolt with a pulling force at a predetermined intermediate magnitude applied by the apparatus. The tension exerted on the lockbolt is reacted against opposite sides of the assembly to exert a compressive force on the assembly to squeeze the desired amount of the fluid out of the interface. The intermediate pulling force is maintained for a precisely timed dwell period based on an optimal period for that fluid and the ambient temperature. After the dwell period, the pulling force is increased in magnitude while simultaneously swaging a collar into threads on the lockbolt to secure the collar on the lockbolt and secure the lockbolt in a state of tension in the hole in the assembly. The pulling force magnitude continues to increase until the pintail breaks off the lockbolt.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Turning now to the drawings, wherein like reference characters designate identical or corresponding parts, and more particularly to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> thereof, an assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of two parts <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is shown having a hole in each part. The holes are aligned to provide a through hole <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in the assembly for receiving a lockbolt fastener <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. A layer <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of viscous fluid material such a sealant or adhesive paste is applied to one or both faying surfaces of the parts <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to bond and seal the interface therebetween. The fluid material <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is typically applied to the top surface of the bottom part <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> before the top part <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is placed on top of the bottom part <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The through hole <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is drilled through the two parts <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, preferably after the parts have been assembled with the sealant <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> in the interface and clamped or otherwise held immobile while the hole is drilled. Of course, the usual assembly will have numerous holes, but the description of one will suffice for all of them. When drilling with sealant in the interface, the better practice is to clamp-up at the drilling location to prevent interlaminer burrs from intruding into the interface. When the parts are drilled separately or when they are match drilled and then separated for de-burring, the sealant is applied after the de-burring step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the lockbolt <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may have a shank <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> sized slightly greater in diameter than the diameter of the fastener hole <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> so that the lockbolt has an interference fit in the hole <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. An interference fit fastener must be driven into the hole <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, thereby cold-working the hole margins for improved fatigue resistance. The lockbolt has a cylindrical or conical head <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> for exerting compressive force on one side of the assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and a collar <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> that is swaged onto an annular grooved section <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> contiguous with the shank <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, for exerting a compressive force on the other side of the assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> equal to the tensile preload in the shank <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. A grooved pintail <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is joined to the annular grooved section <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> by way of a reduced breakneck <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. An installation tool <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, pulls on the lockbolt pintail <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to preload the lockbolt in tension and put the assembly in compression. With the lockbolt held in tension, the tool <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> swages the collar <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> from its outer end onto the annular grooved section <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, and then breaks the pintail <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> off the annular grooved section <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, two installation tools <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are shown for gripping the pintail <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the lockbolt <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and exerting a pulling force while reacting the pulling force with a compressive and swaging force with a die <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> on a nose assembly <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> on the collar <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. The tool <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, includes a body having a handle <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and a barrel <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> enclosing a cylinder <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> in which a piston <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, externally threaded at its front end <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, moves along an axis <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> under influence of hydraulic fluid pressurized in a power unit <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>. The fluid is admitted through a flexible, high-pressure hose <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> coupled to a fitting (not shown) attached to a first fluid passage channel <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> in the handle <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, and spent fluid is vented through a second fluid passage channel <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and a sump hose <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> back to the power unit <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>. Pressurized fluid flow to the cylinder through the first fluid passage channel <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is controlled by the operator by a trigger <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> mounted on the handle <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> in a manner to be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The nose assembly <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the tool <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6</cross-reference>, has a cylindrical die <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> having a front tapering lead-in opening <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> for swaging the collar <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The die <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> has a cylindrical extension tube <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> that is connected to the front end <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> of the barrel <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> by a retaining nut (not shown) which threads onto the front end <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> of the barrel <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and engages an annular lug <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> on the tube <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>. A collet <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> slidably disposed in the tube <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> is internally threaded at its rear end and is threaded into the externally threaded front end <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> of the piston <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The collet <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> has an internal tapering surface <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> that engages a three-piece segmented jaw <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> attached to an elastomeric tube <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> to form a &ldquo;unitized&rdquo; jaw assembly <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>. The three pieces of the jaw <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> are disposed symmetrically around the axis <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the tool and are internally toothed to engage the grooves in the pintail <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Retraction of the piston <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> pulls the collet <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> to the rear which tightens the jaws <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> on the pintail and exerts a tensile force on the lockbolt <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The installation tool <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, shown schematically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, includes a barrel <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> enclosing a cylinder <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> in which a piston <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> moves under influence of pressurized hydraulic fluid admitted to the cylinder <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> on one side or the other of the piston, as in the tool <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. A nose assembly <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is attached to the front end of the barrel <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> and operates in the same manner as the nose assembly <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> on the tool <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. The barrel <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> is connected to an air-over-oil canister <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> by a handle <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>, through which fluid flow lines <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>177</bold></highlight> convey fluid for pressurizing and venting front and rear ends of the cylinder <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> for driving the piston <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> rearward for pulling the lockbolt and swaging the collar <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, and then returning the piston <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> forward for the next lockbolt installation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The pistons <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> in the tools <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, respectively, are energized by hydraulic pressure generated by power units <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>173</bold></highlight> that use an electrically powered hydraulic pump or a pneumatically powered air-over-oil unit, respectively. The pneumatically powered tool <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> has a canister <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> built into the tool itself for the air-over-oil power unit <highlight><bold>173</bold></highlight>. Both power units are provided with pressure regulators and adjustable pneumatic delay and electro/hydraulic delay circuits, respectively, to enable the fastener installation system to operate in accordance with this invention. These two systems will be described below in conjunction with FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the power unit <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> for generating pressurized hydraulic fluid to energize the tool <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> (shown only schematically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>) is shown having an automatic pressure reduction dwell circuit <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and a pump <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> driven by an electric motor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> through a coupling <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. The output of the pump <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> communicates with the tool <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and the pressure reduction dwell circuit <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> via a solenoid-operated valve <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The pressure reduction dwell circuit <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> includes a pressure regulator <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> such as a Enerpac model V-152, connected in series with a two-way solenoid valve <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> such as an Enerpac modular valve model VEK 15000B. The two-way solenoid valve <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is actuated by a time delay relay <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> that is electrically actuated when the operator pulls the trigger <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> of the tool <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. In its un-energized position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the valve <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> couples the pump <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to a fluid line <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> coupled to the fluid hose <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> through which the hydraulic fluid pressurized in the pump <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> pressurizes the rear end of the cylinder <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to push the piston <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to its forward position. Simultaneously, the valve vents the front end of the cylinder <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to a sump <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> through the fluid hose <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and a fluid line <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Pulling the trigger <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> electrically energizes the solenoid of the valve <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to shift the valve from the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> to the other position where the pump <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> communicates through the valve <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to the fluid line <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the pressure hose <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> for conveying pressurized hydraulic fluid to the tool <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> for pressurizing the front end of the cylinder <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to push the piston rearward in a pulling stroke. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Pressure reduction circuit <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> provides a vent to sump for pressure in excess of the pressure set by the adjustable pressure regulator <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, so the pressure passed to the tool <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is the pressure set in the pressure regulator. The solenoid in the valve <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is energized by the time delay relay <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> to hold the valve <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> in the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> until the dwell time set in the time delay relay times out, at which time the valve <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> shifts to close the dwell circuit <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and the pressure rises in the line <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> to the full value produced by the power unit <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>. The time set for the valve <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> to remain in its open position, on the order of 2 seconds, is determined by analysis and confirming test to be that necessary to squeeze the sealant or other fluid in the assembly interface substantially out of the interface around the fastener hole, which is a layer of sealant about 0.006&Prime;-0.008&Prime; thick. At that thickness, there is insignificant additional squeeze-out and the tensile preload on the lockbolt is substantially unaffected by additional squeeze-out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The pneumatic power unit <highlight><bold>173</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> has an air-over oil canister <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> that converts air pressure to hydraulic pressure for operating the piston <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> in the tool <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Air pressure is admitted from an air pressure source <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> through a pneumatic dwell unit <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> or an electro-pneumatic dwell unit <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the pressurized air is admitted to the bottom side of an air cylinder <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> in the air-over-oil canister <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> from an air pressure line <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> from the pneumatic dwell unit <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> through a valve <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> operated by a trigger <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight>. Simultaneously with the pressurizing of the air cylinder <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight>, air pressure from the source is admitted through the trigger valve <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> and a trigger line <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> to the dwell circuit <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight>. The air cylinder <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> has a piston <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> that is driven by air pressure in the cylinder <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, at the start of the cycle in the conventional tool, the trigger of the tool is pulled at point A and full air pressure enters the tool to exert full force on the piston to tension the lockbolt and swage the collar. At point B, maximum pressure is attained in the cylinder and the pintail of the lockbolt is broken. At point C, the swaging die on the nose piece is removed from the swaged collar, which relaxes to the residual load at point D. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the invention as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the tool&apos;s trigger is activated at A and regulated air pressure enters the tool and the timer is started. The lockbolt is pulled in and is held for predetermined time. Collar material <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> flows into the locking grooves <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of the lockbolt <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. At point B, the timer times out and the main air line pressure regulator by-passes the pressure regulator and pulls in the lockbolt with maximum force, finishing the collar swaging and breaking the pintail <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> at point C. At point D, the swaging die <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> on the nose piece <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is removed from the swaged collar <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, which relaxes to the residual load at point E. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, which represents a conventional installation of a lockbolt in an assembly with sealant in the interface between the faying surfaces of the parts, the trigger is pulled at point A, admitting full air pressure to the tool <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Maximum pressure is reached at point B where the collar is swaged and the pintail breaks. The swaging die is removed at point C, but the lockbolt preload continues to decrease along D as sealant continues to squeeze out of the interface between the two parts of the assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In accordance with this invention, the installation of a lockbolt into an assembly with sealant in the faying surface of the interface, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, starts when the trigger is pulled at point A. Regulated air pressure is admitted to the tool to the maximum pressure set in the pressure regulator, and that pressure is maintained during the dwell period shown in the period B. When the timer times out, full air pressure is applied to the tool, reaching maximum at point C when the pintail breaks. The swaging die is removed at point D and the collar relaxes to its residual load at point E. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> An additional unanticipated benefit of the use of this invention is an improvement in the retained tensile preload of fasteners that is independent of the squeeze-out of sealant from the assembly interfaces. That is, the retained tensile preload on the fasteners is greater for fasteners secured using this invention for assemblies that do not use sealant as well as for those that do. Metallurgical analysis of lockbolt collars, partially swaged with a dwell at swaging pressure about 20 psi less than the pressure required to break the pintail before applying the final pressure, reveals that the grain size of the collars is larger than for collars swaged without the dwell, and that more collar material is displaced into the annular grooves or threads of the lockbolt, thereby distributing the load more uniformly on all the threads of the lockbolt. Also, the dwell period gives time for the tool to self-align on the axis of the fastener to ensure better coaxial alignment of the collar on the lockbolt. </paragraph>
