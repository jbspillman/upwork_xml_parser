<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to apparatus and a method for selectively changing the orientation of a mirror, and more specifically, to mirror mounted in or on a vehicle and employing a wireless remote control for changing the field of view of the mirror. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A variety of manually controlled mirrors are typically provided on vehicles, including an interior overhead rear-view mirror, one or more side-view mirrors, and visor mounted vanity mirrors. Another mirror now sold for use in a vehicle is intended for monitoring a child strapped into a rear-facing child car seat. This mirror is mounted and manually positioned so as to enable a driver (or other person) seated in the front seat to view the reflection of a child seated in the rear-facing child car seat by looking at the reflection of that mirror in the conventional overhead rear view mirror. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Several patents have been issued that are directed to mirrors for viewing an infant sitting in a car seat facing toward the rear. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,120,155 (Brennan et al.) discloses a clamping arrangement for attaching a child monitoring mirror to the back cushion of the rear seat in a vehicle. Similarly, U.S. Pat. No. 6,039,455 (Sorenson) discloses an infant observation mirror that is attached to an infant car seat to enable a driver to view the infant in the conventional interior rear-view mirror. A roof-mounted mirror that is intended for use in conjunction with the conventional interior rear-view mirror for viewing an infant is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,576,898 (Rubin). The roof-mounted mirror is hinged so that it can be folded up into the head liner and can also be used by a passenger sitting in the rear seat as a conventional vanity mirror. Finally, U.S. Pat. No. 4,702,572 (Cossey) discloses a mirror that is mounted to the back cushion of a rear seat for viewing an infant and which has an adjustable post secured by a pin for controlling the height of the mirror. The mirror is mounted using a spring-loaded bracket that extends over the top back portion of the rear seat cushion in a vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It would be desirable to enable a user to remotely control the orientation or field of view of a mirror used for viewing an infant. Although the prior art references noted above enable a driver to manually adjust the orientation of a mirror to enable a rear-facing child to be viewed, such manually adjusted mirrors can readily move out of position due to vibration of the automobile or motion of the supporting seat. The child can also change position sufficiently in a car safety seat so as to be outside the field of view of the driver. To correct the mirror position, a driver should stop the vehicle, and enter the back seat of the vehicle to make an adjustment, return to the driver&apos;s seat in order to check the view, and repeat these steps, if necessary, until the proper mirror orientation is achieved, and then continue driving. Within a short time, the mirror may again need to be readjusted due to automobile vibration, supporting seat movement, a child or toy hitting the mirror, or other disturbances to the mirror or child&apos;s position. It would be unsafe for the driver to adjust such mirrors while driving, and leaning over the front seat to reach the mirror is often not possible, particularly for a short driver. Thus, it would be very desirable to enable a user to remotely readjust the orientation of a mirror with a wireless controller, without leaving the front seat. The adjustment of a remote controlled mirror could safely be accomplished while stopped at a stop sign or stop light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> If a remotely controlled mirror is provided for viewing a child or for other purposes on a vehicle, it would be desirable to provide a user full control over the angular position of the mirror about one or both of the X and Y axes. Such a mirror could be used in many other applications besides viewing an infant. For example, an exterior wireless remote controlled mirror could be mounted on one or both sides of the vehicle that was purchased without exterior side mirrors, or to replace manually adjusted side mirrors. Use of such a wireless remote controlled mirror would eliminate the expense and difficulties of routing direct wire connections between a position controller and the mirror(s), and would enable greater flexibility in relocating and readjusting the mirror for various purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Motorized side-view mirrors are often provided as factory installed options on vehicles. However, these motorized mirrors are controlled by a factory installed four-position switch that is hardwired to the mirror by a factory installed wiring harness. The four-position switch is typically located near the driver and if two side mirrors are provided, typically includes a selector switch so that the driver can determine whether the left or right side mirror is controlled by the four-position switch. These switches are connected to the vehicle&apos;s electrical system and hardwired to the side mirrors. If a vehicle was purchased without the motorized adjustable side mirrors, there is typically no easy way to retrofit the vehicle with after market add-on mirrors of that type. Thus, it would be desirable to provide wireless remotely controlled side mirrors that can be retrofitted without the need for installing hardwired switches and complex wiring harness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> One remotely adjusted side mirror is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,056,905 (Jensen). In this invention, which is intended for use on a truck and trailer, a transmitter is mounted at a rear corner of a trailer and directs a signal at an acute angle outwardly from the side of the trailer toward the front of the vehicle. When the truck turns relative to the trailer, the signal from the transmitter is received by a receiver in the outwardly extending rear-view mirror, causing the mirror to change angular position horizontally so that more of the area to the side of the trailer is visible to the driver. When the truck and its trailer are again generally aligned, the signal from the transmitter is no longer incident on the receiver, and the mirror then returns to its normal position in which it shows less of the area to the side of the trailer and more of the area to the rear. In a second embodiment, the transmitter is selectively controlled in response to a steering gear position. However, each embodiment disclosed by Jensen automatically adjusts the position of the mirror in response to the orientation of the vehicle, and not under the control of the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it will be apparent that there is a definite need for a wireless remote controlled mirror for use in various vehicle applications. Such a mirror could be used for viewing a child, as a new or replacement side mirror, or as an auxiliary mirror for extending the view of different portions of the environment around a vehicle. For example, an auxiliary mirror that is capable of wireless remote control could be very useful in extending the view of the road when towing a trailer or carrying loads that block the normal rear view mirror view. The ability to remotely adjust the orientation and view of such a mirror with a wireless control would enable the mirror to be positioned where optimum benefit can be achieved, without requiring any wiring to be installed (if a battery supply is provided on the mirror), or if it is desirable to supply vehicle power to the mirror, by providing only a single power lead to the mirror. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In accord with the present invention, a wireless remote controlled mirror includes a base; a prime mover that is attached to the base, a reflective lens movably coupled to the prime mover; and a receiver that controls the prime mover, such that in response to a wireless signal received by the receiver the prime mover reorients the reflective lens. Preferably, the base is attachable to an object such as an automobile seat or other surface using either a strap, a clip, a clamp, a mounting frame, one or more bolts, an adhesive, or other suitable mount. The reflective lens is coupled to the prime mover and pivots with respect to the base when driven by the prime mover. The prime mover, which is preferably an electric motor, rotates a threaded shaft that engages threads coupled to the reflective lens, causing the reflective lens to pivot. The receiver receives an RF signal from a remote controller that causes the prime mover to drive the reflective lens in a desired direction by pivoting it about an axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> One application of the present invention is directed to a system that enables a front-facing person (e.g., the driver) in a vehicle to remotely control the mirror to view a rear-facing passenger disposed behind the front-facing person, for example, to view a child in a rear-facing child safety seat. Preferably, the wireless remote controlled mirror is mounted either to a rear passenger seat that supports the rear-facing child seat, or directly to the rear-facing child seat. It is also contemplated that the wireless remote controlled mirror might be fabricated as an integral part of a rear-facing child seat. The wireless remote controlled mirror is directed toward a front of the vehicle such that a reflection of the child in the wireless remote controlled mirror may be viewed by the front-facing person, who is looking at the reflection in a conventional rear-view mirror of the vehicle. Preferably, the position of the wireless remote controlled mirror is controlled with a four-way directional switch included on a hand-held remote controller, such as a key fob, in which a transmitter is disposed. The wireless remote controlled mirror can alternatively be mounted on other surfaces of a vehicle and used for other purposes besides viewing a rear-facing passenger. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the present invention is directed to a method for positioning a wireless remote controlled mirror that includes a reflective lens pivotally mounted in a housing.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Base <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> also includes a contoured edge <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> disposed opposite bottom surface <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The contoured edges defines an open end of the base within which the housing is movably pivoted, since the shape of contoured edge <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is designed to accommodate motion of a positioning surface <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> on the rear of the housing <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, opposite front outer edge <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Contoured edge <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> allows positioning surface <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to pivot relative to the base, while also minimizing a gap between contoured edge <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and positioning surface <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>.

In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>B, for the sake of clarity, reflective lens <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is not shown. Within housing <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is disposed a dome <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> having a convex rear surface and including a socket <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). Socket <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> extends from the center of the convex rear surface of dome <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> through an orifice <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of positioning surface <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Socket <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> provides an interference snap fit over a pin <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Pin <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> has a ball <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> that is inserted through a hole <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of base <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and through a hole <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> formed in a circuit board <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, pin <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may be formed as part of base <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and extend from the center of the interior portion of base <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Socket <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> holds the convex rear surface of dome <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in sliding contact with an inner or front surface <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of housing <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, which, in turn, maintains positioning surface <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of housing <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in sliding contact with contoured edge <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of base <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. This arrangement of sliding surfaces enables housing <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to pivot relative to dome <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and base <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, both of which are stationary as the housing and reflective lens are moved. </paragraph>

Threaded shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is thus a worm gear that acts on driven threads <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, causing positioning surface <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of housing <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to pivotally slide between contoured edge <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of base <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the convex surface of dome <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Those skilled in the art will recognize that a variety of other driving means may be employed to pivot housing <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, or reflective lens <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Other means contemplated for coupling one or more prime movers to housing <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> include a ball joint, a universal joint, a linkage bar, a spring, or a cable, but it is clear that still other conventional techniques can be employed in some form of transmission that is used to direct a force applied by a prime mover to moving the housing and the reflective lens about one or two axes. </paragraph>

When one of the motors is activated by a drive signal (discussed below), the threaded shaft by that motor causes housing <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to pivot through an angle of up to about 60, so that the reflective lens is reoriented to a new position, for example, as illustrated by broken lines delineating housing <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&prime; and bezel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>&prime;. While movement about only one axis is illustrated, it will be apparent that a similar movement about an orthogonal axis (extending from left to right through base <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, as shown in the example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) can also be carried out by energizing the other motor. Both motors can be energized simultaneously to cause movement about both orthogonal axes at the same time, if desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates preferred application of the present invention in which the mirror is employed in a vehicle for viewing a child. An automobile <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> includes a front seat <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and a passenger seat <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> that is disposed behind front seat <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. Strapped onto passenger seat <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is a rear-facing child safety seat <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, which designed to support a child facing toward a rear of automobile <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. A driver or other person (not shown) in automobile <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> may use a conventional overhead rear-view mirror <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> to view an area behind front seat <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, but the child is not normally visible in the conventional overhead rear-view mirror, since the child is hidden by the rear-facing child safety seat. Even when turning around, the child will not normally be visible. To solve this problem, mirror <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is mounted to a headrest <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> that is attached to passenger seat <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. The driver can then view the child inside rear-facing baby seat <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> via a line of sight <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>&mdash;but only if the orientation of mirror <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is set so that the reflection of the child in the reflective lens of mirror <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is visible in the conventional overhead rear-view mirror.

<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference> illustrates one preferred approach for attaching mirror <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to a vehicle seat. One end of a nylon strap <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is attached to mounting clip <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of base <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Nylon strap <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is horizontally wrapped around headrest <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, and an opposite end of nylon strap <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is attached to mounting clip <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>(not shown in this Figure). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference> illustrates another preferred technique for attaching mirror <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to a vehicle seat. Two nylon straps <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are vertically wrapped around headrest <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> of rear seat <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>.

Base <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>&prime; is optionally shaped to match the front surface contour of headrest <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a block diagram of a preferred embodiment of an electrical circuit for mirror <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. A power supply <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> provides electrical power to all electrical components in the circuit that require power. Preferably, power supply <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> employs storage or rechargeable batteries; but optionally, it is also contemplated that power supply <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> can be energized with power drawn from the electrical system of a vehicle. For example, the mirror might be coupled to a cigarette lighter receptacle, to draw 12 volt direct current power from the vehicle battery/alternator (not shown). A receiver <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> receives a signal that was transmitted from a wireless remote controller (discussed below). Preferably, the signal is an RF signal, and receiver <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is an RF receiver. However, those skilled in the art will recognize that an infrared receiver, microwave receiver, optical receiver, or other wireless signal receiver may by employed. Receiver <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> relays the signal to a local controller <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, which determines the type of command conveyed by the signal that was received. For example, the signal may convey a command that indicates a direction in which the reflective lens in mirror <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is to move, or a defined position previously stored in memory to which reflective lens <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is to be reoriented. Another command that can be indicated by the signal is a programming command that causes a current position of the reflective lens to be stored in memory. Optionally, memory <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> maybe used to store a plurality of previously set positions, in addition to storing machine instructions used for controlling local controller <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, and for storing other data. The commands can be pulse code modulated, or frequency shift keying, or may use other well known techniques for distinguishing between a limited set of commands conveyed by an RF signal or other type of signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Once local controller <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> determines the specific wireless command that was received, local controller <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> issues an appropriate drive signal to energize the prime mover, such as an electric motor <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, which must cause the required movement to reorient the reflective lens. As described above, the motor causes its threaded shaft to rotate, which drives threads on the lens housing, thereby causing the lens housing to pivot. Preferably, electric motor <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>provides a driving force to move the motor housing in a selected direction about an axis that is orthogonal to the axis about which the driving force provided by electric motor <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>pivots the reflective lens. When electric motor <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is energized, an optional sensor <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>detects motion of the lens housing. Sensor <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may be any one of a number of conventional motion sensors, such as a potentiometer that detects rotation of the threaded shaft, an optical or magnetic sensor that detects pivoting of the lens housing, a timer that detects duration of motion, or a simple logic gate that only detects that motor <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is energized. In turn, sensor <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may optionally transmit a motion signal back to local controller <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> to provide a closed loop control; however, the user can monitor the orientation of the reflection in the reflective lens to provide the necessary closed loop control of the reflective lens orientation. Once receiver <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> no longer receives the transmitted wireless command from the wireless remote controller <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> or has achieved a position previously stored in memory, in accord with the command that was last transmitted, local controller <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> de-energizes the motor and motion of housing <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and reflective lens <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> stops. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> A wireless remote controller <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is preferably similar in shape and size to a key fob, such as those used to wirelessly, remotely lock and unlock a vehicle. Also, wireless remote controller <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is preferably sized and shaped to be stored in channel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) when the mirror and remote controller are removed from the vehicle. A housing <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the remote controller is preferably made of a plastic material with a volume sufficient to contain a battery used for a power supply (not shown), a small circuit board (discussed below), and a four-position rocker switch <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Preferably, wireless remote controller <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> transmits an RF signal that conveys different commands to the mirror. However, those skilled in the art will recognize that an infrared signal, a microwave signal, an optical signal, or other wireless signal may instead be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Preferably, a four-position rocker switch <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is used to control the desired directional orientation of reflective lens <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in mirror <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. However, an additional keypad <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> can be provided to enable other types of commands or functions to be selected by a user. For example, pressing a keypad button <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> may cause wireless remote control <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to transmit a signal, commanding an incremental position change of the mirror lens relative to one or both of the orthogonal axes of the mirror housing. Alternatively, specific keypad buttons on keypad <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> can be assigned to different previously set positions of the reflective lens that have been stored in the memory of mirror <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. For example, when one keypad button A is pressed, a signal is transmitted to the mirror commanding the reflective lens to move to a previously stored position assigned to keypad button A for use by a tall driver. Another position of the reflective lens might be stored in the memory for and assigned to a keypad button B for use by a short driver of the vehicle. In this manner, the setup time required to properly orient reflective lens <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> when either the short driver or the tall driver drives the vehicle after the other driver is substantially shortened. It would not be necessary to reorient the mirror incrementally each time that a different driver uses mirror <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the vehicle, following its use by another driver. This function is somewhat like that provide by a memory seat position in modern cars that enables a driver to select an assigned button that returns the seat and other driver specific setting to previously stored conditions. Another keypad button may enable a user to activate or deactivate an optional light (not shown) on the mirror. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In addition, remote controller <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may include an optional indicator <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> that is a light emitting diode (LED) used to indicate that transmission of a wireless command signal is in progress. Alternatively, indicator <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> may be continuously lighted or blink in a specific pattern to indicate that power is available, or conversely, that battery power is low. Those skilled in the art will recognize that a variety of other buttons, keypad configurations, and/or other features may be included on the wireless remote controller <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Such features may include operation as a universal remote control to control a door locking system, a panic button for sounding an alarm, a garage door opener, etc. It is also contemplated that dual mirrors <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be controlled with a single remote controller that is provided with a selector switch (not shown) to enable a user to select one of two different mirrors <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> that will be controlled with the signals transmitted from the remote controller. </paragraph>

A power supply <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> includes a storage or rechargeable battery that provides electrical power to all electrical components in the circuit that require such power. When a user indicates a desired direction by activating a four-way switch <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, the four-way switch selects the corresponding signal transmitted and a fob controller <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> provides the appropriately encoded signal to convey that command to a transmitter <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, one of the buttons on a button array <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> (corresponding to keypad <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>) is activated by the user to indicate a command signal that fob controller <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> will cause transmitter <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> to transmit. Fob controller <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> determines the type of command that will be transmitted in response to the user action and controls transmitter <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, causing the transmitter to transmit that command. An optional memory <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> is used to store previously defined positions, options, machine instructions for fob controller <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, and other data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> illustrate other preferred embodiments for mounting the wireless remote controlled mirror to an object. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> illustrates a clamp <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> that enables the mirror to be clamped to a child safety seat, or to a vehicle seat, or to some other object. It is contemplated that mirror <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> might be mounted to objects not used in a vehicle, such as to a shelf, a playpen, a swimming pool, a boat dock, or any other object suitable for supporting the mirror to view a desired location. Clamp <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is preferably connected to base <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> by a semi-rigid, but flexible gooseneck <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. Gooseneck <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> enables coarse positioning of the mirror so that it is directed generally as desired, whereas the mirror provides fine positioning through its remote control functionality. Those skilled in the art will recognize that clamp <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> may be directly attached to base <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, or may be connected to base <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in a variety of other ways. </paragraph>
