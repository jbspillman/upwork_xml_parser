<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> There are several methods and apparatuses that are conventionally well known. The present technology presently known is described below. There are several problems that are associated with the present technology for the pressure regulator valves. The present invention solves such problems by introducing innovations making the present invention of superior quality as compared with the prior art technology. The problems associated with the prior art technology are high line pressure and harsh shifts or slide <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> related to slow line rise. Furthermore, there is a breakage of forward clutch drum caused by high engagement pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The vehicles with a CD4E transmission often have excessively high line pressure, which can lead to broken forward drums and other parts. This high line pressure is due to unregulated EPC pressure forcing the pressure regulator valve into the maximum line position. Valve body bore wear at the pressure regulator valve contributes to the problem by allowing balance and regulated line pressure to bleed through to exhaust. The present invention provides a solution to the above stated problem. The present invention comprises a self-regulating pressure regulator valve that limits TV pressure. Annular grooves have been added to prevent side loading by properly centering the valve in the bore. The valve has been manufactured from anodized aluminum to extremely tight tolerances and is slightly oversized to restore hydraulic integrity at all spool/bore interfaces, after the bore is reamed and the valve is installed. An o-ringed end plug is also included to prevent EPC/TV leakage from the valve body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> There are several known prior art patents that are available in the field and their discussion follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,618,036 to Ideta teaches a hydraulic control system for lock-up clutch of torque converter. This particular piece of the prior art is a hydraulic control system comprising a pump driven by an engine to discharge hydraulic fluid, a torque converter having a lock-up clutch with a lock-up clutch piston movable to a clutch released position when fluid pressure within a lock-up release chamber is higher than fluid pressure within a working chamber within a torque converter cavity, a line pressure regulator valve and an orifice which provides a restricted flow communication between the torque converter and the pump even when line pressure generated by the line pressure regulator valve is lower than a predetermined value. The present invention comprises a self-regulating pressure regulator valve that limits TV pressure. Annular grooves have been added to prevent side loading by properly centering the valve in the bore. The valve has been manufactured from anodized aluminum to extremely tight tolerances and is slightly oversized to restore hydraulic integrity at all spool/bore interfaces. An o-ringed end plug is also included to prevent EPC/TV leakage from the valve body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,611,371 to Wirtz teaches a shift/regulating valve for controlling a hydrodynamic torque converter for an automatic transmission comprising a shifting component, a valve body defining a control pressure chamber for a fluid mechanism having an end facing the shifting component, an end remote from the shifting component, and a guide bore extending from the control pressure chamber to the end remote from the shifting component. Furthermore, this prior art further comprises a spool disclosed slidably in the guide bore and having at least one control groove thereon, a control pressure outlet from the control pressure chamber, a first pressure connection to the control pressure chamber and a second pressure connection connecting at least one working chamber with at least one outlet. Moreover, the shift/regulating valve comprises a resilient element for biasing the spool toward the shifting component, wherein a second pressure connection is connected to an outlet through a control groove, a control member located in the control pressure chamber, having a first end remote from the shifting component projecting into the guide bore, and a longitudinal bore connecting the control pressure chamber to a regulating pressure chamber bounded by the spool and the control member and a pressure connection terminating in the end of the control pressure chamber remote from the shifting component. The present invention provides numerous differences and advantages over the prior art. The present invention is a self-regulating pressure regulator valve that limits TV pressure. Annular grooves have been added to prevent side loading by properly centering the valve in the bore. The valve has been manufactured from anodized aluminum to extremely tight tolerances and is slightly oversized to restore hydraulic integrity at all spool/bore interfaces. An o-ringed end plug is also included to prevent EPC/TV leakage from the valve body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The discussed prior art presents a formidable database of information. However, this prior art does not attempt to solve the problems that the present invention is designed to answer. The present invention is a pressure regulator valve that prevents high wear and tear when used under normal operational conditions of a land motor vehicle transmission. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It should be clear to one skilled in the art, that the above discussed prior art is used for the purposes of illustration and should not be construed as limiting in any way, except for the prior art elements claimed in the above patents. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a pressure regulator valve replacement assembly. The present invention would be better understood in conjunction with a following description of a preferred embodiment. However, it is understood by one skilled in the art that the present invention is not limited to the above referenced specific embodiment, but other embodiments are allowable, provided they are within the scope and spirit of the following claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In the following description, references to the drawings, certain terms are used for conciseness, clarity and comprehension. It is assumed by one skilled in the art that there are to be no unnecessary limitations implied from the such references, besides the limitations imposed by the prior art, because such terms and references are used for descriptive purposes only and intended to be broadly construed. Furthermore, the description and the drawings are for illustrative purposes only and not to be construed as limited to the exact details shown, depicted, represented, or described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the present invention is shown comprising a pressure regulator valve assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In a particular embodiment, the valve <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be fabricated from anodized aluminum to withstand extremely tight tolerances and is slightly oversized to restore hydraulic integrity, at all spool/bore interfaces, after the bore is reamed. The assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a body <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, a snout <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which is further shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and will subsequently be described in more detail. The assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a ball <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> that is placed in the entrance. Furthermore, the space that is formed between the walls <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the snout <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is filled with a lubricant gel like substance <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, which prevents valve assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from fast degeneration from the pressure that is being applied to it. The assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> further comprises, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> spring <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, that compresses at an according rate to allow a certain amount of pressure to be let it. Whenever a pressure is applied to the valve assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, spring <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> compresses under the pressure of the ball <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the ball <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, may be fabricated from pure steel and may have a diameter of 1.1875 inches. Furthermore, in another embodiment, the spring <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be a musical wire that is compressible at a specified frequency of compression of 10 cycles per second and a temperature of 300 degrees Fahrenheit. Finally, in yet another embodiment, the lubricant <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> may be any conventionally known lubricant that would perform like a gel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the snout <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is shown. The snout <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has walls <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> that come in contact with the ball <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The walls <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> form a trapezoidal structure that is capable of receiving the ball. The top of this structure has a channel <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and an opening <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> that leads out of the valve assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. On the opposite end of the snout, the outer casing is threaded <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in order to properly connect with the threaded part of the valve body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the present invention is shown to have annular grooves <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The annular grooves <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> serve to prevent side loading by properly stabilizing and centering the valve <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the bore. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows the annular grooves from view X of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Plug <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, seals the end opening of the valve body casing bore in which the pressure regulator valve assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, sits. The plug <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is an addition, which serves to prevent EPC/TV pressure leakage from the bore. The plug <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is inserted in the end of the valve body casing bore after the bore has been reamed and the new valve assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has been installed. An o-ring groove <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>, is made up of walls <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> on the plug <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. These walls protrude from the center of the plug <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and allow for the installation of an o-ring <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. This o-ring <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, fits in the o-ring groove <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, and creates a more positive seal at the end of the bore. It is the combination of the plug and the o-ring that prevents EPC/TV pressure from escaping through the valve body casing bore. The plug <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> does not make contact with the valve assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, but rather is inserted in the end of opening of the valve body casing bore after it is reamed and the valve <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is installed. There are no threads to hold the plug <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> in place, rather it is forced into the bore where it is held under its own power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In the foregoing description of the invention, reference to the drawings, certain terms, have been used for clarity, conciseness and comprehension. However, no unnecessary limitations are to be implied from or because of the terms used, beyond the requirements of the prior art, because such terms are used for descriptive purposes and are intended to be broadly construed. Furthermore, the description and illustration of the invention are by way of example, and the scope of the invention is not limited to the exact details shown, represented, or described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> While the present invention has been described with reference to specific embodiments, it is understood that the invention is not limited but rather includes any and all changes and modifications thereto which would be apparent to those skilled in the art and which come within the spirit and scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
