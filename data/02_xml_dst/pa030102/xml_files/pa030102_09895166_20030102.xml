<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an MP3 player device, more particularly, to an MP3 player with large storage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Developments of all assortments of audio players and storage for audio data are progressing up date owing to the need of human kinds for audio storing. Especially under the drive of the needs for audio devices of the Internet and multimedia, efforts are further made to audio players and storage for audio data to make them with higher quality, higher stored capacity, and more convenient for use. The storage for audio data and audio players in the market are in sequence a phonograph disk and a phonograph player, a magnetic recorded tape and a magnetic recorders, a compact disk (CD) and a CD-ROM, a digital versatile disk (DVD) and a DVD ROM, and flash ROM and an MP3 player. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Magnetic recorded tapes are not able to be sustained for a long time, and are easy to be demagnetized by ultra-violet ray, plus their small capacities and being sensitive to noise signals which make the magnetic recorded tapes gradually decline on the market. In a CD-ROM, a laser light incidents a compact disk and reflexes back to an optical pickup head through the disk with audio data molded in. The reflex optical signals and thus the audio signals are digital, and which considerably make the signals themselves immune to noise, and thereby high audio quality is achieved. The disk is easy to conserve, with high capacity, low in cost, immune to interference of noise; which make the storage itself and the associated player extremely popular on the market and cut the first edge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> An MP3 player is much easier to use for music listening. The audio data are specifically compressed and stored in a semiconductor memory, such as ROM, EPROM and flash ROM. Although an MP3 player is small in dimension, easy to carry, the memory it uses costs very high as compared to compact disks. Generally, the size of the memory used for an MP3 player is 16 MB, and which is corresponding to a 15-minute period of length. To update the data in a small-sized memory for an MP3 player, a computer is needed to do write or rewrite audio data to the MP3 player. To increase the capacity of a memory of an MP3 player, added-on cards can be inserted into the player, but the cost needed is just sharply risen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Consequently, a small-sized, light, capacious, easy-used, and low-priced storing device for audio data and a player has become the goal of the researchers&apos; and users&apos;. MP3 players have received widely popularity since its open to the market. If the bottleneck for small storing space on MP3 players has a breakthrough, then MP3 players will be provided with all advantages as mentioned above. For that reason, how to improve MP3 players has drawn much attention from the insiders and symbolized the progress of audio processes in electronic industry. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMERY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In view of the shortcoming a conventional MP3 player suffers, the present invention suggests a combined MP3 player machine with a large memory that can be accessed by the controller of the MP3 player. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In this invention, compact disks (recordable compact disk, re-writable compact disk, hard disk) are utilized as the memory and a CD-ROM (CD-R, CD/RW, Hard disk, etc.) is positioned as the ducking station of the MP3 player by use of combining the MP3 player and the CD-ROM. The CD-ROM is self-powered, and thus separated from a computer. The MP3 player is fabricated on the CD-ROM and can be independent and detachable from the CD-ROM. When they connect together, audio data can transmit to the MP3 player from the CD-ROM through the interface between them; such as USB, EPP, SCSI, IDE, and the like; and capacious storage is well provided. When the combined machine is connected to a computer through an interface, the MP3 player can be programmed through the USB (RS232, EPP, SCSI, IDE, etc.) interface of the CD-ROM, since the USB (RS232, EPP, SCSI, IDE, etc.) port of the MP3 player is locked and bypassed to the USB (RS232, EPP, SCSI, IDE, etc.) port of the CD-ROM. When the combined machine plays, the audio signal of the MP3 to the earphone or speaker is locked and bypassed to the earphone or speaker of the CD-ROM. When the MP3 player is extracted from the combined machine, it can be a player itself. The consumer, the combined MP3 player with a large memory, and the computer are well integrated, and the capacious memory for the MP3 player is perfectly achieved by bridging over the MP3 player and the compact disks. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> To settle the limited memory issue on a conventional MP3 player, the present invention provides herein a large memory for the MP3 player without needing high cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, which depicts a function block of the MP3 player used in prior arts. The audio data storage <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is typically flesh ROM (ROM, or EPROM is allowed also), and with a size of 16 MB, which is unsatisfied for current use. With the use of an external memory card (not shown for simplicity), the cost may be very high and thus not practicable. Furthermore, when updating new music or audio data for the MP3 player <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a connection with a computer is needed. In the prior art, the computer can program the internal storage <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> through the interface port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to the computer interface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in the MP3 player <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Since the MP3 audio data is specifically compressed, the audio data fetched from the storage <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> by the player controller <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is fed into the MP3 decoder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for decoding. The decoded audio data are then fed into the audio signal generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and then outputted to the earphone or speaker <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In this invention, an MP3 ducking station is combined with the MP3 player in prior arts to obtain a combined machine (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) with a large memory. For the profile of the combined machine, see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The ducking station <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is located below the MP3 player <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and they jointly form a combined machine <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The combined machine <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is self powered or can be optionally powered by a computer when they are connected. The ducking station <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> can be CD-ROM, CD-R, CD/RW or a hard disk, all of which are able to provide mass storage for the MP3 player <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. A computer can program the MP3 player <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through the USB (EPP, SCSI, IDE, or RS232, etc.) interface of the CD-ROM <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> since the USB (EPP, RS232, SCSI, or IDE, etc.) port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the MP3 player <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is locked and bypassed to the USB (EPP, SCSI, RS232, or IDE, etc.) port <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the CD-ROM <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> when the MP<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> player <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is placed on the CD-ROM <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> for use. Similarly, the signal generated from the audio signal generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the MP3 player <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is locked and bypassed to the earphone or speaker <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the CD-ROM <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> for the combined machine so that audio can be outputted from the earphone or speaker <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the CD-ROM <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> since the CD-ROM is provided with a higher power speaker. For the combined machine <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> itself, the controller of the MP3 player <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can read the audio data stored in the compact disk (now shown) through the interface (USB, IDE, SCSI, EPP, RS232, etc.) between them, which will be explained in more detail, and thus obtain a large memory since the compact disk is capacious and can be enlarged by use of a plurality of disks. The MP3 <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> itself is self-powered or powered by the ducking station <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> when they are connected. The MP3 <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is optionally detachable from the combined machine <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and work as a player. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Continuing back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the player controller <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can not only address the internal storage <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, but also the storage in the ducking station <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The controller <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> issues an address signal for read, the internal storage <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> or the storage <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> in the sucking station <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> addressed then transmits the audio data requested by the controller <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to the decoder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, since the MP3 data is specifically compressed. The audio signal generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is then charge of outputting audio through the earphone or speaker <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Continuing to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, besides the strategy programming the storage <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the MP3 player <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through the USB port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> from a computer, the computer can program the internal storage <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the MP3 player <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through the bypass <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, which is extended from the USB interface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the MP3 <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the interface <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the ducking station <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. With the bypass <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, programming from the computer to the internal storage <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the combined body is possible. Similarly, the audio signal to the earphone or speaker <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the ducking station <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is obtained through the bypass <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> from the audio signal generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in the MP3 player <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, since the CD-ROM has a higher power speaker. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Since the controller <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can access the internal storage <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the storage <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> in the ducking station <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, a large memory equipped MP3 player is thus achieved, and a consumer, the combined MP3 player with a large memory, and a computer is thus integrated together. </paragraph>
