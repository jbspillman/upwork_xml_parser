<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">Telecommunication carriers that provide collect and bill-to-third-party calls face considerable revenue losses due to unbillable, uncollectible, and fraudulent calls. This real-time call validation system reduces the number of unbillable calls by determining when the dialed number has been ported, the originating carrier has no billing relationship with the terminating carrier, or the dialed number belongs to a customer of a switchless reseller, all events that in today&apos;s environment would result in an unbillable call. This system also decreases subscriber fraud by identifying in real-time a dialed number&apos;s listed name and address and determining whether there are other numbers associated with said name and address and, if so, whether they are associated with a history of fraud, bad debt, or unbillability. Finally, this system provides a real-time method for applying industry-standard credit assessment tools to the management of collect and bill-to-third-party accounts. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates in general to telecommunications systems and in particular to methods for reducing bad debt, fraud and unbillability related to collect and, in some cases, bill-to-third-party telephone calls utilizing a real-time call validation system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Discussion of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Collect and Bill-to-Third-Party Call Billability </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Telecommunications carriers typically invoice collect calls to the called party through a called party&apos;s Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) with a call detail record (CDR) of the call appearing on the called party&apos;s local telephone bill. Today, as many as ten percent of collect calls are deemed &ldquo;unbillable;&rdquo; that is, the carrier that provides the collect call service is unable to invoice the called party for the call through their LEC. If a collect or &ldquo;bill-to-third-party&rdquo; call is unbillable, the originating carrier must find a way to bill the called party (or the &ldquo;bill-to-party&rdquo; in the case of a bill-to-third-party call) directly. Not only is this process costly, but typically carriers only end up collecting 5% to 10% of the revenues for collect and bill-to-third-party calls that they bill directly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> There are three primary reasons why so many collect calls are unbillable: the introduction of Local Number Portability (LNP), the growth in the number of Competitive Local Exchange Carriers (CLECs), and the development of switchless resellers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Local Number Portability is a telecommunications network capability that allows a subscriber of a telecommunications service provider (a user) connected to the public switched telephone network (PSTN) through a particular service provider to move to a different service provider while retaining his or her public directory number. Such change of service provider will at some time likely result in the user&apos;s telephone appearance on the network moving to a different switching system. In moving to a different service provider, the user becomes a &ldquo;ported subscriber.&rdquo; Other network users can connect to the ported subscriber without any changes to their dialing procedures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Telephone numbers in the pre-LNP environment are assigned to local telephone end offices on the basis of geography. Numbers begin with a three digit numbering plan area designation, or NPA (more commonly known as an area code), followed by an office exchange number or NXX (i.e., the first three digits of a local seven digit telephone number). A complete telephone number takes the form of an NPA-NXX office designation and a four-digit line number sequence, or NPA-NXX-XXXX. Each XXXX represents one of 10,000 different customer telephone numbers. In effect, the dialed NPA-NXX is the terminating switch&apos;s (pre-LNP) routing address for the rest of the network. Thus a pre-LNP telephone number serves two functions: identifying the customer, and providing the network with information needed to route a call to the customer. Upon introduction of LNP, these two functions are separated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A basic approach that has been adopted for implementing LNP is known as location routing number (LRN) architecture. The LRN architecture uses a unique 10-digit location routing number to identify each switch in the network for call-routing purposes. As in the familiar 800/888 (or, more generally, 8xx) toll-free calling service, an LNP database is used to store routing information, but the LNP database stores routing information for telephone numbers of subscribers who have selected another local service provider and have been moved to that provider&apos;s switching system. Thus, the LNP database contains the directory numbers of all ported subscribers and the location routing number, or LRN, of the switch now serving each of these numbers. LNP requires that end-office switching systems be able to determine whether a dialed NPA-NXX is included in the portability environment. In making this determination, switching systems typically set triggers to occur based on detection of a dialed number including an NPA-NXX for which portability is available. Usually, only one customer&apos;s line need be ported for the trigger to be active for all XXXX associated with that NPA-NXX. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> These triggers are designed to give rise to a query to the Local Number Portability database (&ldquo;LNP database&rdquo;) to retrieve the Local Routing Number of the dialed number. The LNP database is typically accessed for such queries from switches using advanced intelligent network (AIN 0.1) telecommunications call processing capabilities and signaling protocols such as transaction control application part (TCAP) intelligent network protocols. That is, queries from switches to an LNP database, and responses from the LNP database, are advantageously communicated using standard common channel signaling messages over the CCS7 (Common Channel Signaling System 7) network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Typically, the switch (a Service Switching Point or SSP) from which the call originates sends an LNP query over the signaling network to a Signal Control Point (SCP) which accesses the LNP database in order to retrieve the routing information for a ported subscriber. If the dialed number has been ported, the query response from the SCP will contain the pertinent Local Routing Number in the Called Party Number (CPN) field and the Ported Dialed Number (PDN) (i.e., the number originally dialed) in the Generic Address Parameter (GAP) field. Alternatively, if the call is destined to a number that has not been ported, the query response will simply keep the dialed NPA-NXX-XXXX number (the dialed number or DN) in the CPN parameter to indicate that it should be used for routing purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Carriers will provide LNP via a system of multiple, regional databases. Such regional databases reduce capacity concerns that would be encountered with a single national LNP database and reduce the distance over which routing information need be sent. These regional databases are administered and maintained by a national Number Portability Administration Center (NPAC). NPAC provides updates to these databases when end users change terminating office connections, typically when these users are moved from one local service provider&apos;s switching system to another local service provider&apos;s switching system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The introduction of Local Number Portability has created new challenges for communications carriers that need to bill for collect calls and calls billable to third parties. Carriers typically do not bill the recipients of a collect call directly for that call. Rather, they provide the call detail record (CDR) to the recipient&apos;s local exchange carrier (LEC) to be billed on the call recipient&apos;s local telephone bill. To accomplish this task, carriers often use a billing clearinghouse to bill their collect calls, although they may also elect to perform this function themselves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In most cases, the carrier will, on a weekly basis, send a data file to the clearinghouse containing the call detail records (CDR) for all of its collect calls for the previous week. The clearinghouse will import the CDR file into its billing program which will then analyze the NPA-NXX of each CDR to determine to which other telecommunications carrier the CDR should be sent in order to bill the call on the recipient&apos;s local phone bill. To determine which NPA-NXX belongs to which carrier, the clearinghouse relies on NPA-NXX database tables provided and maintained on a national basis by the Traffic Routing Administration (TRA), a division of Telcordia Technologies (formerly Bellcore). For example, analysis of the CDR of a collect call to 404-467-XXXX would determine that the CDR should be sent to BellSouth to be rebilled to the call recipient on his or her local phone bill. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In a pre-LNP environment, the method of analyzing the NPA-NXX to determine to which carrier to CDR should be sent functioned satisfactorily. The nationwide implementation of LNP, however, has resulted in a significant increase in the number of collect calls that telecommunications carriers are unable to rebill through the LECs. If subscribers port their directory numbers to a different carrier, in essence, they have changed their local exchange carrier without changing their NPA-NXX. Upon analysis of the NPA-NXX of the CDR of a call to such a subscriber, the clearinghouse will mistakenly send the CDR to the carrier to which the TRA assigned that NPA-NXX. However, as the subscriber has ported the directory number to a different carrier, the carrier to which that NPA-NXX belongs will reject the CDR and send it back to the clearinghouse with a Return Code of 50. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> A Return Code 50 indicates that the call cannot be billed by the receiving carrier due to non-ownership, portability or resale of the line. Non-ownership simply means that the NPA-NXX of the CDR did not belong to the carrier to which the CDR was sent in the first place. Portability, as has been described above, implies that while the NPA-NXX of the dialed number does belong to the carrier to which the CDR was sent, the number has been ported to a different carrier. Resale means that the number belongs to a customer buying local exchange services from a non-facilities based (i.e., switchless) reseller of the local exchange carrier&apos;s service. In such a case, the carrier will actually terminate the collect call on behalf of the reseller, but the CDR will be rejected with a Return Code 50 because the CDR should be sent to the reseller rather than to the local exchange carrier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,699,416 to Atkins (1997) attempts to address some of these issues by querying a LNP database to identify the appropriate Line Identification Database (LIDB) for performing billing validation. LIDB databases typically contain all billable directory number accounts maintained by a service provider. Carriers query LIDB databases prior to connecting a collect, third party, or calling card call to validate the dialed number (e.g., can it receive collect calls), the calling card (e.g., is the PIN correct), etc. As more CLECs enter the local telecommunications market, they may choose to maintain their own LIDB database or choose to use a LIDB database shared with other service providers. Thus dialed directory numbers with the same NPA-NXX may be found in different LIDB databases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Atkins provides a way of determining which of a plurality of LIDB databases a carrier should query to validate a call. However, a dialed number may be ported to a different carrier yet still be contained in the same LIDB database in which it was originally stored. In fact, given that there are currently only twelve LIDB databases in North America covering extensive regional areas, this is more likely to be the case than not. In such a case, a clearinghouse would still be unable to bill the collect call to the correct local exchange carrier. The billing clearinghouse, which still parses call detail records on the six-digit NPA-NXX rather than the ten-digit dialed number, will provide the CDR to the LEC to which the NPA-NXX has been assigned. The LEC will still reject the call detail record since the dialed number has been ported to another carrier. In other words, identifying the correct LIDB database to query does not ensure that the call can still be billed correctly. Atkins&apos; invention fails to provide a way of identifying when a number has been ported and block a call to that number prior to its connection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> It is therefore one object of the present invention to reduce the number of unbillable collect and bill-to-third-party calls that result when the call recipient has ported his or her directory number to a different local service provider. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The proliferation of new competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs), both facilities-based (have their own switches) and non-facilities based, has also driven a significant increase in the number of unbillable collect calls. To rebill a call to another carrier, the originating carrier or its billing service provider must have a contractual agreement in place with the carrier providing the called party&apos;s local service in order to rebill the call. In some instances, the clearinghouse may actually not have a direct billing relationship with the recipient&apos;s carrier, particularly in the event the carrier is one of the smaller CLECs. In such cases, the clearinghouse may have a billing relationship with another clearinghouse that specializes in billing to the increasingly large number of smaller CLECs. Illuminet and NECA are two such clearinghouses that specialize in rebilling calls to smaller CLECs. Thus a call to a subscriber of such a CLEC may go from the originating carrier to its clearinghouse to a second clearinghouse before eventually being rebilled through the CLEC to the call recipient. However, in an ever increasing number of cases, the originating carrier or its clearinghouse will not have either a direct or an indirect (i.e., through a second clearinghouse) billing relationship with the call recipient&apos;s carrier. In such a case, a collect call to such a carrier would be unbillable. The dilemma for the originating carrier of a collect is to know prior to connecting the call whether it has a billing relationship&mdash;direct or indirect&mdash;established with the carrier that will ultimately be responsible for invoicing the called or billed party for the call. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an object of the invention to reduce the number of unbillable collect and bill-to-third-party calls by identifying when the call recipient or billed party is a subscriber of a local service provider with which the originating carrier has no direct or indirect billing relationship. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The third major source of unbillable collect and bill-to-third-party calls is a result of the development largely since the Telecommunications Act of 1996 of the switchless or non-facilities based reseller. A switchless reseller is a company that, as the name implies, resells the services of a local exchange carrier under its own brand name. Since the reseller is &ldquo;switchless&rdquo; (or &ldquo;non-facilities based&rdquo;), the LEC must provide the necessary switching services to the reseller&apos;s customers. The reseller typically provides sales, marketing, billing, and collection services which are branded under the reseller&apos;s corporate name. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> At the end of a billing period, the LEC will provide billing information to the reseller in order to invoice the reseller&apos;s customers. The reseller can then provide its customers an invoice under its own letterhead. Alternatively, the LEC may produce invoices for the reseller utilizing the reseller&apos;s letterhead. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> When a collect or bill-to-third-party call is placed to a number of a customer of a switchless reseller, the originating carrier will go through the same routine as it does with any other collect or bill-to-third-party call. Typically this consists of first performing a LIDB query to determine whether or not the dialed number is allowed to receive a collect call. If the query response is affirmative, the carrier will then query an LNP database to determine whether the number has been ported, and, if so, to where the call should be routed. Having determined that the dialed number can receive a collect call (i.e., no blocking indicator has been set in the LIDB database) and that the number has not been ported, the carrier will connect the call to the dialed number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> A dilemma arises when the originating carrier (or its billing clearinghouse) needs to bill the called party, the reseller&apos;s customer, for this call. The originating carrier will analyze the NPA-NXX of the dialed number and determine that the call detail record should be sent to the LEC in question. However, the LEC will reject the call detail record with a Return Code of 50, because the pertinent call detail record should be sent to the switchless reseller. In all likelihood, the originating carrier will have no billing relationship, either direct or indirect, with the switchless reseller as switchless resellers are many in number, are usually quite small in size, and typically have billing relationships only with the LEC providing their switching service. Hence, collect and bill-to-third-party calls to switchless resellers are almost always unbillable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The Ordering and Billing Forum of the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions (ATIS) has been discussing the issue of billing collect and bill-to-third-party calls to the customers of switchless resellers for a considerable time. However, at the time of writing, the telecommunications industry has yet to come up with a solution to this problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> This problem manifests itself with particular acuity in the inmate telephone business. Realizing that collect calls to switchless resellers may go unbilled, the families and friends of inmates may even subscribe to a switchless reseller&apos;s service specifically to receive inmate collect calls. One analysis of a sample of collect calls from inmates in correctional facilities indicated that as many as five percent of the calls were made to customers of switchless resellers all of which were therefore unbillable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an object of the invention to reduce the number of unbillable collect and bill-to-third-party calls by querying a multiplicity of databases to determine whether the dialed number belongs to a switchless reseller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> It is a further object of the invention to reduce the number of unbillable collect and bill-to-third-party calls by querying a database of collect call records to determine if previous calls to a particular number were unbillable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Subscriber Fraud </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Fraudulent telephone activity for collect and bill-to-third-party calls presents a significant and increasing problem to telecommunications carriers. Such fraudulent activity may include subscriber fraud. Typically, this type of fraudulent activity occurs when a subscriber signs up for telecommunications services and proceeds to use the services with no intent to ever pay for the services provided. Such a fraudulent subscriber would continue to use the services without paying until the network access was blocked by the service provider. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> This category of subscriber fraud is quite prevalent in the inmate calling business, the segment of the telecommunications industry dedicated to providing phone services to jail and prison inmates. Inmates&apos; family members will obtain a second telephone number from a different local exchange carrier from the one providing their primary service. The family members will use that second number to receive collect calls from the inmates, incurring substantial telephone charges which they never pay. When the LEC providing the second line finally disconnects the service (often after a period of many months during which a significant amount of collect call debt has been incurred), the inmates&apos; family may simply obtain a third telephone number from yet another LEC, and the fraud begins all over again. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Prior attempts to detect and prevent such fraudulent telephone calls have been made, but with generally unsatisfactory results. For instance, because the LEC&apos;s are responsible for billing most customers utilizing the long distance or interexchange carrier&apos;s (IXC) toll services, the LEC would provide customers who were delinquent in paying their bills with a predetermined grace period prior to suspending the delinquent customer&apos;s access to the IXC network for collect and third party service. As a result, the IXC would continue to incur high revenue losses as a result of the delinquent customer&apos;s continued use of long distance services during this grace period until access to such service was suspended by the LEC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,754,632 to Smith (1998) attempts to address subscriber fraud partially by utilizing address information to determine if one customer account matches another. However, this patent does not provide a solution to subscriber fraud in relation to collect or bill-to-third-party calls. For example, the proposed solution depends on the analysis of address data that are part of the account information owned by a particular telecommunications carrier. By their very nature, collect and bill-to-third-party calls are more often than not to telephone numbers (i.e., accounts) that do not belong to the originating carrier. Hence U.S. Pat. No. 5,754,632 fails to provide a solution to subscriber fraud when no address data are available because the called party is not a subscriber of the originating carrier&apos;s service. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> It is therefore one object of the invention to provide a method of identifying the described type of subscriber fraud prior to the connection of a collect or bill-to-third-party call to a called party that is not necessarily a customer of the originating carrier. What is needed is a real-time method for obtaining the address of the dialed number and determining whether that same address has been used for other dialed numbers, and, further, whether a history of fraud, bad debt, and/or delinquent accounts is associated with that same address. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The lack of a listed name and address prior to the processing of a collect call presents one other problem in the inmate calling business. Typically, in prisons or penitentiaries, inmates&apos; phone calls are restricted to a list of numbers that is commonly known as an &ldquo;allow list.&rdquo; For example, an inmate may only be allowed to call his mother, his girlfriend, and his attorney. If the inmate attempts to call a number that is not on his/her allow list, the inmate telephone system blocks the call. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Currently, correctional officers have no automated way of verifying that the telephone numbers on the lists submitted by the inmates belong to the people the inmates claim they do. The verification of the numbers on inmates&apos; allows lists is so labor-intensive that the ownership of most numbers simply goes unverified. In other words, correctional staff simply must trust that the inmate is providing accurate information as to who are the owners of the telephone numbers on his/her allow list, which, for obvious reasons, is far from an ideal situation. It is therefore an additional object of the invention to provide an automated method of verifying ownership of the telephone numbers on a correctional inmate&apos;s allow list. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Finally, it common within the inmate calling industry to analyze the calls made by multiple inmates to a common telephone number. The purpose of such analysis is to detect possible patterns of illicit activity (e.g., drug trafficking) that may be perpetrated from within a single or multiple correctional facilities. One obvious way that inmates can evade such security efforts is to call multiple numbers that connect to the same address. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> What is needed is a real-time method for providing a listed name and address for each telephone number an inmate dials. It is therefore one object of the present invention to provide such a method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Utilizing Credit Scores to Assess Risk and Reduce Bad Debt </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Telecommunications carriers use a variety of tools to minimize bad debt. Included among these is the use of credit scores provided by credit reporting bureaus to establish and update subscribers&apos; credit limits. Those skilled in the art are well familiar with how credit scores are used to minimize the risk of bad debt in providing services to a carrier&apos;s own subscribers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In the case of a collect call, the originating carrier must rebill the call to the called party, which, in most cases, is not a subscriber of the carrier&apos;s own service. The carrier has no means of obtaining a credit score or performing a credit assessment of the called party as it does not know in advance to whom its subscriber (i.e., the calling party) will make a collect call. Furthermore, the originating carrier does not have the data (name, address, telephone number, and, ideally, Social Security number) typically required to obtain credit information related to the called party. In essence, the originating carrier is extending credit to the called party blindly with no ability to assess the latter&apos;s ability or willingness (based on past payment history) to pay for charges incurred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> This dilemma manifests itself with particular acuity in the inmate calling business, that segment of the telecommunications industry dedicated to providing telephone services to inmates in correctional facilities. Whereas collect calls make up only a small percentage of the gross revenues of most telecommunications carriers, an overwhelming percentage of inmate calling providers&apos; revenues is derived from collect calls. The rate of bad debt or &ldquo;uncollectibles&rdquo; in the inmate calling industry averages between 10% and 15% of gross revenues, a staggering percentage in comparison with other segments of the telecommunications industry or, indeed, any industry. As described above, inmate calling providers have no method for using credit information such as credit scores to set credit limits and/or determine whether a collect call should even be connected given the respective credit history of the called party. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Some inmate calling providers do set credit limits on the monetary value of collect calls that can be made to a particular number during a particular period (e.g., $200 per month). However, since no credit information (e.g., a credit score) is available prior to the call being connected, such credit limits tend to be set on a &ldquo;one size fits all&rdquo; basis. In other words, every call recipient&apos;s credit limit is set at the same level regardless of whether they have a good credit history or a bad one. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,615,408 to Johnson, et al. (1997) provides a means of using credit scores for managing accounts of subscribers of telecommunications services. However, this patent fails to provide the real-time solution required by providers of collect call and bill-to-third-party call services. The patent describes a method that requires that a carrier wishing to use credit information for account management purposes have in hand the data necessary for obtaining the desired credit information related to the a specific account or phone number (typically the subscriber&apos;s name, address, and Social Security number). Such a solution is inadequate for providers of collect call and bill-to-third-party call services as they typically only have one piece of data&mdash;the dialed telephone number&mdash;and nothing more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> What is needed is the ability to obtain a credit score and/or perform a credit assessment of the called party or third party prior to the connection of a collect or bill-to-third-party call. It is therefore one object of this invention to provide a real-time method for enabling telecommunications carriers to obtain credit scores and perform credit assessments of the called party in real-time to make credit decisions based on the called party&apos;s (or bill-to-third-party&apos;s) credit history and thereby reduce the bad debt and fraud associated with collect and bill-to-third-party calls. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a real-time call validation system that substantially obviates one or more of the problems due to the limitations and disadvantages of the related art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The present invention is a call validation system that provides a range of services designed to reduce the amount of unbillable, uncollectible, and fraudulent collect and, in some cases, bill-to-third-party calls. To reduce the number of unbillable collect calls, the invention utilizes a series of queries of Local Number Portability databases and other databases containing NPA-NXXs and Operating Company Numbers (OCNs) to (1) determine whether there is a previous history associated with that number of bad debt, fraud, or unbillability, (2) determine whether the dialed number has been ported, (3) identify the local service provider that will terminate the call, (4) determine whether the originating carrier has a billing relationship with said local service provider, and (5) determine whether the dialed number belongs to the customer of a switchless reseller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> To reduce subscription fraud, the invention performs a reverse directory lookup of in a directory assistance database to obtain the dialed number&apos;s listed name and address, then searches a database to determine if there are other dialed numbers associated with that same address, and, if so, whether those numbers involve bad debt or delinquent accounts. The invention may also be used to verify in a correctional facility whether the telephone numbers submitted by an inmate indeed belong to the person to whom the inmate claims. The invention may also further be used to detect when calls from one or more correctional facilities have been made to the same address by multiple inmates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Finally, to decrease bad debt, the invention uses the telephone number, listed name and address and other data provided by the carrier (e.g., Social Security number) to obtain a telco credit score and other credit information that can be used to determine whether credit should be extended in the form of a collect or bill-to-third-party call, and, if so, how much. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, several objects and advantages of the present invention are that it provides a real-time method for accomplishing the following tasks: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide a real-time call validation method that reduces the percentage of unbillable collect and bill-to-third-party calls further by determining prior to the connection of the call whether the dialed number belongs to a switchless reseller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide a real-time call validation method that decreases subscriber fraud by determining if there are other telephone numbers associated with the dialed number&apos;s listed address that involve bad debt or delinquent accounts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide a real-time call validation method that facilitates the ability of staff in correctional facilities to verify ownership of a telephone number submitted by an inmate for his/her allow list. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide a real-time call validation method that enhances the capability of correctional officers to determine when multiple inmates have made telephone calls to the same address. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Reference will now be made to the preferred embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the present call validation system consists of a combined computer and telecommunications system as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Exemplary operation of the preferred embodiment will now be described. In this example, telephone <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is connected via circuit <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight> with the originating carrier&apos;s switch <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>, which, in all likelihood, would be the switch of a Local Exchange Carrier (LEC). Switch <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> is connected via circuit <highlight><bold>173</bold></highlight> to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. The calling party at telephone <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> wishes to make a collect call to telephone <highlight><bold>183</bold></highlight>. Telephone <highlight><bold>183</bold></highlight> is connected via circuit <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> to the terminating carrier&apos;s switch <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> which, in all likelihood, is also a Local Exchange Carrier&apos;s switch. Switch <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> is connected to the PSTN <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> via circuit <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. Typically, when switch <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> wishes to send a collect call to a number not resident in its own database, it will perform a query on a Line Identification Database <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> available via circuit <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> that connects the switch <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> to the SS7 network <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>A. The purpose of this query is to determine whether the dialed number is capable of receiving a collect call. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The Point of Presence <highlight><bold>149</bold></highlight> (POP) is a telecommunications facility housing various hardware and software systems required to offer the real-time call validation services. To send call validation queries to POP <highlight><bold>149</bold></highlight>, originating switch <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> is connected to the Internet <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> via circuit <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight>. POP <highlight><bold>149</bold></highlight> is in turn connected to the Internet <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> via circuit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. The POP contains four principal elements. The first is a Central Control Server <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> that receives and processes validation queries from customers of the validation service (i.e., telecommunications carriers). Central Control Server <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> is connected to a Database Server <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> via circuits <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> with a firewall <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> in between to provide data security. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Central Control Server <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> is also connected via circuit <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> to SS7 Server <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight>. SS7 Server <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> contains special boards such as those manufactured by NMS Communications that enable queries and responses to be sent to and from the SS7 Network. SS7 Server <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> is connected to the SS7 Network <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>B via a 64 kbps circuit <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> known as an &ldquo;A-Link.&rdquo; Server <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> connects with a Signal Transfer Point (STP) <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>, which relays queries over circuit <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> to Local Number Portability Database <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> To perform its real-time validation services, Central Control Server <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> must also be capable of querying other databases available via the Internet <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. In particular, Central Control Server <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> will send queries to a Directory Assistance Database <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> connected to the Internet via circuit <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>. Similarly, the Central Control Server <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> will send queries to a Credit Reporting Bureau Database <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> connected to the Internet via circuit <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> One skilled in the art can appreciate that the principles of the invention are not limited by the architecture of the switching and/or computer network used, but rather are applicable to a wide variety of switching and computer network architectures. For example, all of the call validation services provided by this invention could be performed utilizing telecommunications and computer equipment housed within the same facility as the originating carrier switch. Similarly, said call validation services could even be embedded within the software of the originating switch itself or in a peripheral computer connected to the originating switch. For the sake of simplicity, a single telecommunications and computer network architecture has been described above for the purposes of illustrating the operation of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates how the invention will determine whether a collect call or bill-to-third-party calls is billable. Description is made with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. Prior to connecting a collect call from phone <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> to phone <highlight><bold>183</bold></highlight>, originating carrier switch <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> (or some peripheral computer equipment connected to switch <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>) will send a message over the Internet <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> (or alternatively over a direct circuit) to Central Control Server <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> for the purpose of determining whether the call will be billable. This message will contain, among other data, the dialed number (i.e., phone <highlight><bold>183</bold></highlight>&apos;s directory number) to which the calling party wishes to make the collect call. In Step <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, the Central Control Server <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> receives this message, authenticates the message, and validates the carrier as a customer of the call validation service. In Step <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, Central Control Server <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> determines that the carrier has requested that the billability of the dialed number be analyzed. In Step <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, Central Control Server <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> retrieves the dialed number from the carrier&apos;s message. In Step <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, Central Control Server <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> looks up the dialed number in an internal database stored on Database Server <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> to determine if the number is associated with a prior history of unbillability, bad debt, or fraud (see decision point <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>). If there is such a history, the Central Control Server <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> will set the relevant flags in Step <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> in the response message to be sent back to the originating carrier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The next series of steps relate to determining whether the dialed number has been ported or not. In Step <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, Central Control Server <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> sends a message to SS7 Server <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> containing the pertinent telephone number. In Step <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, SS7 Server <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> sends a TCAP query to LNP Database <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> via the SS7 Network <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. SS7 Server <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> receives the query response in Step <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> and passes this information back to Central Control Server <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>. In Step <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, Central Control Server <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> compares the ten digits in the Called Party Number field (field <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>) of the query response with the original dialed number to determine if the number has been ported (that is, moved to the switch of a carrier to which the NPA-NXX of the dialed number does not belong). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Step <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> represents the decision point where the invention determines whether the number has been ported. If the number has been ported, the Called Party Number (CPN) field in the query response message will contain the Local Routing Number rather than the dialed directory number, and the dialed directory number will have been placed in the Generic Address Parameter field (field <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>). If not ported, the dialed directory number will be the same as the number in the Called Party Number (CPN) field contained in the query response message. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> If the query response indicates a ported number, in Step <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> Central Control Server <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> will set an indicator to be used in the return message to the originating carrier that the number has been ported, and, as such, may need to be blocked. The term &ldquo;blocked&rdquo; or &ldquo;block&rdquo; as used herein is not intended to be limited simply to the denial of a call. Instead, the term may be user-defined to include, for example, denial of the call, redirecting the call to a live operator, offering the caller or the called party an alternative billing method, and so forth. In one alternative embodiment of the invention, the carrier may insert an indicator or flag in the Call Detail Record to indicate to the carrier&apos;s own billing program or that of its clearinghouse that the call needs to be invoiced to a carrier different from the carrier to which the dialed number&apos;s NPA-NXX belongs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The purpose of Steps <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> is to identify who the terminating carrier is. If the dialed number has been ported, in Step <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> Central Control Server <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> will extract the first six digits of the Local Routing Number which, in essence, equate to an NPANXX belonging to the terminating switch. To identify the terminating carrier, Central Control Server <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> will then look up these six digits in an internal database stored on Database Server <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> that contains tables of NPA-NXXs and the carriers to which they belong. Such tables are available on a subscription basis from the Traffic Routing Administration, a division of Telcordia Technologies. If the dialed number has not been ported, in Step <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> Central Control Server <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> will simply use the NPA-NXX of the dialed number to perform this lookup query. Central Control Server <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> will use these queries to obtain both the carrier&apos;s name and the Operating Company Number (OCN) of the terminating carrier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Having identified the terminating carrier, the next Step <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> is to determine whether the originating carrier has a billing relationship (either direct or indirect) with the terminating carrier. Once again, the Central Control Server <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> will look up in tables in an internal database on Database Server <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> to determine whether the originating carrier can bill calls to the terminating carrier. The originating carrier or its clearinghouse may provide the tables containing the OCNs of carriers with which they have billing agreements. Alternatively, Central Control Server <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> may examine a table of NPANXXs to which the originating carrier or clearinghouse has indicated it can bill calls. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Step <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> represents the decision point where it is determined whether the carrier or the clearinghouse can bill to the pertinent NPA-NXX. If not, in Step <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, Central Control Server <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> returns a message to the carrier indicating that the call cannot be billed due to the lack of a billing relationship with the terminating carrier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> If determined that the carrier or clearinghouse can bill to the pertinent NPA-NXX, Central Control Server <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> proceeds to Step <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> where it determines if the dialed number belongs to a switchless reseller. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> contains an exploded view of how the present invention determines whether the number belongs to a switchless reseller. The first Step (<highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>) is to look up the NPA-NXX of the dialed number in an internal database to identify which database should be searched to determine whether a number with a particular NPA-NXX belongs to a switchless reseller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> There are four options. First, in Step <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>, Central Control Server <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> searches an internal database where the Local Exchange Carrier has agreed to provide a database of reseller numbers. Second, in Step <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, Central Control Server <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> performs a query in Directory Assistance Database <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> where the LEC in question consistently identifies when a listed number belongs to a switchless reseller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The other remaining two options involve queries of LEC&apos;s proprietary databases (referred to herein as &ldquo;Customer Service Record databases&rdquo;) that are used by CLECs and IXCs to make inquiries about particular numbers, order repair work, etc. In Step <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, Central Control Server <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> queries the type of Customer Service Record database where if the number belongs to a switchless reseller, the database query returns no record. In Step <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, Central Control Server <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> queries the type of Customer Service Record database where the reseller&apos;s name is stored in the Bill To field. In an additional step (<highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight>), Central Control Server <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> determines through a query of an internal database of reseller names whether the name in the Bill To field is a switchless reseller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Returning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, if it is determined the dialed number belongs to a customer of switchless reseller, in Step <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> Central Control Server <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> returns a message to the originating carrier indicating as such. Alternatively, having determined that the dialed number has not been ported nor belongs to the customer of a switchless reseller and that that the originating carrier has a billing relationship with the terminating carrier, Central Control Server <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> will in Step <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> return a message indicating that the call appears to be billable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> describes the Steps involved in the present invention&apos;s real-time method for preventing subscriber fraud. In a typical scenario, the calling party will attempt to make a collect call to a particular number. The originating carrier wishes to determine whether there is any evidence of subscriber fraud associated with the dialed number. In Step <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, Central Control Server <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> receives a message from said carrier and validates the carrier as a customer of the subscriber fraud prevention service. In Step <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, Central Control Server <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> determines that the carrier has requested the subscriber fraud prevention service. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Central Control Server <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> retrieves the dialed number from the carrier&apos;s message in Step <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>, and in Step <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> sends a Reverse Directory Lookup query containing this number to Directory Assistance Database <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>. In Step <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>, Central Control Server <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> receives the query response containing the listed name and address then searches an internal database stored in Database Server <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> in Step <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> to determine if there are other telephone numbers associated with the dialed number&apos;s listed name and address (decision point <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> If not, Central Control Server <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> returns a response in Step <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> to the carrier indicating that there is no evidence of subscriber fraud. However, if another telephone number(s) has been found that is associated with the dialed number&apos;s listed name and address, the same query is used to determine whether there is any previous history of fraud, bad debt, or unbillability associated with the other telephone number(s) (decision point <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>). If so, in Step <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> Central Control Server <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> returns a message to the carrier indicating what evidence was found. If no such evidence is found, in Step <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> Central Control Server <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> returns a message indicating the existence of other number(s) associated with the same listed name and address as the dialed number but with no previous history of fraud, bad debt or unbillability. While not shown on <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> for simplicity&apos;s sake, the message returned to the carrier may indicate when there is a match on the listed address but not the listed name and when there is a match on both fields. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> depicts an alternative embodiment of the present invention, namely an automated method for verifying the ownership of a telephone number. As described in the Background section above, one application of this embodiment could involve a correctional officer who wishes to verify the information related to a list of telephone numbers provided to him/her by a prison inmate. However, many other potential applications exist. For example, a hospital emergency room admissions clerk may wish to verify the information that a patient (or a family member) has provided on a registration sheet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> As in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, Steps <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> describe how the present invention will obtain in real-time the listed name and address of a particular telephone number utilizing a Reverse Directory Lookup (RDL) query of Directory Assistance Database <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>. However, in this scenario, the carrier sends not only the telephone number(s) in question but the supposed owner&apos;s name and address as provided by the inmate. In Step <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>, Central Control Server <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> compares the actual listed name and address provided from the RDL query with the information provided by the inmate. In Step <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight>, a response message is sent to the carrier containing the listed name and address information from the RDL query along with a flag that is set to &ldquo;true&rdquo; to indicate that these data match those provided by the inmate and to &ldquo;false&rdquo; if they do not. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Typically, all the Steps contained in dotted box <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> would be performed either on an automated basis by the carrier&apos;s inmate telephone system or manually by a correctional officer. In Step <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>, the message containing the listed name and address is received from Central Control Server <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>. The flag indicator is checked in Step <highlight><bold>509</bold></highlight> to determine if the RDL query data and the inmate data match (refer to decision point <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>). If the flag is set to &ldquo;true,&rdquo; then in Step <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight>, the telephone number is added to the inmate&apos;s list of numbers he/she is allowed to dial and another flag is set to indicate that the name and address information have been successfully verified. If the information from the RDL query and the inmate&apos;s list do not match, then in Step <highlight><bold>513</bold></highlight> a flag is set to indicate that further investigation is required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> One skilled in the art can appreciate that an equally possible alternative would be for the carrier (or the corrections facility itself) to send a message containing only the telephone number that the inmate wishes to add to his/her allow list. Upon performing the RDL query, Central Control Server <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> would return the listed name and address, and the carrier or the correctional staff would themselves compare the data returned in the RDL query with that provided by the inmate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> As noted in the Background section above, most inmate telephone systems provide a report that indicates when multiple inmates have called the same telephone number. The purpose of the report is to help correctional staff and police investigators identify potential patterns of illicit activity (e.g., drug trafficking). Currently, inmates may thwart such efforts by dialing multiple numbers at the same address. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> describes yet another alternative embodiment of the invention, in this case, a method of determining when multiple inmates of correctional facilities have called telephone numbers at the same address. As before, Step <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> show how Central Control Server <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> receives a message from the originating carrier or correctional facility and validates the carrier or facility as a customer of the service. In Step <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> it is determined that the one-address-multiple-numbers query has been requested. In Step <highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight> Central Control Server <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> retrieves the dialed number from the message and, in Step <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>, performs a Reverse Directory Lookup query in Directory Assistance Database <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Upon receipt of the RDL query response in Step <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight>, Central Control Server <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> in step <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> searches an internal database stored on Database Server <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> for other telephone numbers with the same listed address as that provided in the message from the carrier or correctional facility. If no address information were readily available in such a database, Central Control Server <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> could alternatively obtain from the Directory Assistance Database <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> other telephone numbers listed with the number from the original query and then query an internal database to determine if these numbers had been previously called by an inmate. As a third alternative, Central Control Server <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> could simply obtain all the telephone numbers with a given listed address and return those to the carrier or correctional facility so that they could determine whether calls had been made to these numbers on their own. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Step <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> shows the decision point of whether calls have been made to the same address (either to one number of multiple numbers) by multiple inmates. If yes, Central Control Server <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> sends a response to the carrier or correctional facility containing a list of the telephone numbers called as well as the listed name and address. If no, Central Control Server <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> responds that no other inmates have called the particular address in question. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> describes the Steps involved one embodiment of the present invention&apos;s real-time method for providing credit scores and other credit information to providers of collect and bill-to-third-party call services. As before, in step <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> Central Control Server <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> receives a message from the carrier that is originating the call and validates the carrier as a customer of the service. In Step <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>, Central Control Server <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> determines that the instant credit score service has been requested and, in Step <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight>, retrieves that dialed number from the carrier&apos;s message. Step <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> consists of Central Control Server <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> sending a Reverse Directory Lookup query in Directory Assistance Database <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>, the response to which is received in Step <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> In Step <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight>, Central Control Server <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> utilizes the dialed number and the information provided by the Reverse Directory Lookup query (listed name and address) to send a second query to Credit Reporting Bureau database <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, the response to which is received in Step <highlight><bold>707</bold></highlight>. Central Control Server <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> in Step <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> then retrieves the credit score and other credit history information obtained from Credit Reporting Bureau database <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. Typically this credit score will be a &ldquo;telco credit score&rdquo; especially developed for the telecommunications industry for trying to predict the likelihood that a consumer will or will not pay his/her telephone bill. The other credit information provided may include, for example, records of any unpaid telephone or other utility bills over the last 24 months. In some cases, multiple scores may be returned (e.g., two instances of a &ldquo;B. Smith&rdquo; residing at &ldquo;123 Main Street&rdquo;). In such cases, Central Control Server <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> in Step <highlight><bold>709</bold></highlight> creates an average credit score. In Step <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>, Central Control Server <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> returns the credit score(s) and other credit information to the originating carrier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Armed with this credit information, the carrier must now decide whether to connect the call or not (decision point <highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight>). If the credit score is very low or the called party shows a history of not paying his/her telephone bill, the carrier may decide to block the call (Step <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight>). The term &ldquo;blocked&rdquo; or &ldquo;block&rdquo; as used herein is not intended to be limited simply to the denial of a call. Instead, the term may be user-defined to include, for example, denial of the call, redirecting the call to a live operator, offering the caller or the called party an alternative billing method, and so forth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Should the carrier elect to connect the call (Step <highlight><bold>715</bold></highlight>), it may still use this credit information, as depicted in Step <highlight><bold>714</bold></highlight>, to determine what credit limit, if any, should be imposed on the dialed number account. For example, the carrier may decide to set a limit of $150 per month on collect and bill-to-third-party calls to the dialed number in question. Or, alternatively, the credit score and history may be so favorable that the carrier decides not to set any credit limit on calls that number. The key point is that the carrier now has relevant information provided in real-time that enables it to make credit decisions (e.g., connect the call, establish a credit limit, etc.) on the basis of the called party&apos;s credit score and history. In Step <highlight><bold>716</bold></highlight>, Central Control Server <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> stores the credit limit in an internal database for future use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> describes the logic and sequence of steps of an alternative embodiment of the instant credit score service. Steps <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>809</bold></highlight> are similar to Steps <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>709</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> except in Step <highlight><bold>803</bold></highlight>, Central Control Server <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> retrieves not only the dialed number but credit decision parameters provided by the originating carrier. In Step <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight>, Central Control Server <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> utilizes the credit score and history in the context of the credit decision parameters provided by the originating carrier to determine whether the call should be connected or not. If not, Central Control Server <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> sends a message to the originating carrier in Step <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight> to block the call which the carrier does in Step <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> If it is decided that the call should be connected, Central Control Server <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> in Step <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight> again makes use of the credit score and history and carrier&apos;s credit decision parameters to determine whether a credit limit should be established for the dialed number account and, if so, how much. In Step <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight>, Central Control Server <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> sends a response to the carrier indicating that the call should be connected and the credit limit to be imposed on this particular account. The carrier connects the call to the dialed number in Step <highlight><bold>817</bold></highlight> and records the credit limit to be established in an internal database in Step <highlight><bold>818</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the reader will see that this real-time call validation system resolves at once many issues that have long plagued the providers of collect and bill-to-third-party call services. The invention significantly reduces the number of unbillable collect and bill-to-third-party calls by determining prior to the call: (1) whether the originating carrier has a billing relationship with the terminating carrier; (2) whether dialed number has been ported and therefore, in today&apos;s environment, is considered unbillable; and (3) whether the dialed number belongs to a customer of a switchless reseller which would also make such a call unbillable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> This call validation system also provides an automated method of preventing subscriber fraud by identifying the listed name and address of the dialed number in real-time and determining whether there are other telephone numbers associated with said name and address, and, if so, whether they are associated with a history of fraud, bad debt, or unbillability. The invention further provides staff in correctional facilities with an automated method for verifying ownership of numbers on inmates&apos; proposed allow lists and enables them to identify instances where multiple inmates are calling the same address. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Finally, the present invention for the first time offers carriers a method for utilizing industry-standard credit assessment tools in determining whether a collect or bill-to-third-party call should be connected, and if so, whether a credit limit should be established and at what level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> The collective effect of the various services provided through this real-time call validation system will be to reduce carriers&apos; losses due to unbillable, uncollectible, and fraudulent collect and bill-to-third-party calls thereby increasing their overall profitability. </paragraph>
