<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an automobile rubbing strip, and more particularly to an illuminating rubbing strip for an automobile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Safety is the most important thing for automobile drivers and that is why all cars are equipped with head lights, tail lights and signaling lights so as to show to other drivers that there is a car moving or turning. However, during the nights, in the raining days or in a big parking lot where the lighting is not sufficient to show to others that there is a car moving or turning, collisions happen from time to time. With the front lights and the tail lights, a head-on collision may be avoided when drivers keep a safety distance from others. However, when the car is turning, drivers can only tell from the blinking of the signaling light, which is far more inefficient and ineffective to warn others. Because the signaling lights takes only a small portion in the car body, drivers easily overlook the blinking of the signaling lights and tragedy happens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> To overcome the shortcomings, the present invention intends to provide an improved car rubbing strip to mitigate or obviate the aforementioned problems. </paragraph>
