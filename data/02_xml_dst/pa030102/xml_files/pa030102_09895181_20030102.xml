<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to electronic thermometers and, more specifically, to such an electronic thermometer, which uses an electric heater to pre-warm the housing, preventing the housing from absorbing heat energy received by the detection tip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A variety of mechanical and electronic thermometers have been disclosed, and have appeared on the market. A regular electronic thermometer has a metal detection tip adapted to detect the temperature of the object to which the metal detection tip is attached. Because the housing absorbs heat energy received by the metal detection tip, it takes 2&tilde;3 minutes to obtain the accurate temperature value (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). There is known an electronic thermometer with electric heater that pre-warms the housing when switched on to measure the temperature of, for example, a patient. This structure of electronic thermometer, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, comprises a housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime;, a cap-like detection tip <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>&prime; fixedly fastened to the front side of the housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime;, an induction chip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime; and an electric heater <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime; respectively mounted in the cap-like detection tip <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>&prime; and connected to a control circuit assembly (not shown) in the rear side of the housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; by respective conductors <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&prime;. When switching on the electronic thermometer, the electric heater <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime; is turned on to pre-warm the housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime;, preventing the housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; from absorbing heat energy received by the cap-like detection tip <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>&prime;. This design of electronic thermometer with electric heater is still not satisfactory in function. The drawbacks of this design of electronic thermometer are numerous and outlined hereinafter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 1. Because the induction chip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime; and the electric heater <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime; are installed in the narrow inside space of the cap-like detection tip <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>&prime;, the fabrication procedure of the electronic thermometer is complicated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Because the inside space of the cap-like detection tip <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>&prime; is narrow, the capacity of the electric heater <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime; is limited, and it takes much time to warm up the housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; to the desired level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> 3. Because the induction chip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime; and the electric heater <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime; are close to each other, the induction chip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime; may be affected by the radiation heat of the electric heater <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime;, resulting in a detection error. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> 4. Because pre-warming time is long (about 20 seconds), it takes much time (about 30 seconds, i.e. pre-warming time 20 seconds plus measuring time 10 seconds) to complete a measuring procedure. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been accomplished to provide an electronic thermometer, which eliminates the aforesaid drawbacks. It is the main object of the present invention to provide an electronic thermometer with electric heater, which requires less time to complete a measuring procedure. It is another object of the present invention to provide an electronic thermometer with electric heater, which achieves accurate temperature detection within a short time. According to the present invention, the housing has an elongated front neck, which separates the induction chip and the electric heater, preventing the radiation of heat of the electric heater from affecting accurate temperature detection of the induction chip. Because the electric heater is installed inside the housing remote from the cap-like detection tip, the capacity of the electric heater can be relatively increased so that the electric heater can quickly warm up the housing to the desired level during each measuring action.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, an electronic thermometer in accordance with the present invention comprises a housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a cap-like detection tip <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> fixealy fastened to one end of the housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has a rear receiving chamber <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, which receives a control circuit assembly <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. An induction chip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is mounted inside the cap-like detection tip <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and adapted to detect the temperature of the object to which the cap-like detection tip <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is attached. Conductors <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are connected between the induction chip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the control circuit assembly <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> for signal transmission from the induction chip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the control circuit assembly <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has an elongated front neck <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> connected between the rear receiving chamber <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the cap-like detection tip <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. An electric heater <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is mounted in one end of the elongated front neck <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> remote from the cap-like detection tip <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, i.e., inside the throat between the neck <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the rear receiving chamber <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and electrically connected to the control circuit assembly <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> by conductors <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Because the electric heater <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the induction chip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are disposed at two ends of the elongated front neck <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the induction chip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is free from the effect of the electric heater <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, i.e., the heating operation of the electric heater <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> does not affect accurate temperature detection of the induction chip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, when switching on the electronic thermometer and attaching the cap-like detection tip <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the skin of the body of the patient, the control circuit assembly <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> immediately drives the electric heater <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to pre-warm the housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to a predetermined temperature level (for example, about 35&deg; C.) below human body temperature, and the induction chip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is induced by the body temperature of the patient to output a signal to the control circuit assembly <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, causing the control circuit assembly <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to output a digital signal indicative of the body temperature of the patient. Because the electric heater <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is turned on to pre-warm the housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> when switched on the electronic thermometer, no significant temperature difference occurs between the housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the cap-like detection tip <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> during measuring. Therefore, the housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> does not absorb heat energy from the cap-like detection tip <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to affect accurate detection of the induction chip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. According to the present invention, it takes only about 10 seconds to complete one measuring action. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> A prototype of electronic thermometer has been constructed with the features of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>. The electronic thermometer functions smoothly to provide all of the features discussed earlier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Although a particular embodiment of the invention has been described in detail for purposes of illustration, various modifications and enhancements may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the invention is not to be limited except as by the appended claims. </paragraph>
