<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method, system, and program for implementing an auction using calendar information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Much has been written about Internet auctions, where interested buyers submit bids to purchase products over the Internet. One of the more successful and profitable Internet companies is Ebay, Inc., which allows sellers to auction goods and products by requesting that buyers submit bids for their goods and products. Interested buyers may then submit bids to purchase the auctioned product. Internet sites also allow for reverse auctions where interested buyers of a product can request that sellers of the product submit bids over the Internet to sell the desired product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Although the use of the Internet to auction goods and products is well established, less established is the auctioning of services that are purchased for specific time slots. For instance, a person may want to purchase a professional service for one or more calendar time slots. Alternatively, professionals may want to auction their services for available time slots. In enabling the auctioning of services, the time availability of the person requesting bids for the service must be taken into account as the service cannot be offered or provided for times when the bid requestor is unavailable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Thus, there is a need in the art for a system that enables the auctioning of services for calendar time slots so as to ensure that bids are submitted for those times that the bid requester is available to receive or offer the service. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Provided is a method, system, and program for implementing an auction. Scheduled event records for a user are maintained within a computer database, wherein each scheduled event record indicates a scheduled event for the user at a calendar time slot. A request is received for bids for a service from the user indicating a time period, wherein the service is to be performed during a calendar time slot within the indicated time period. A determination is made of scheduled event records for the user within the indicated time period. A template is generated to display a calendar for the indicated time period showing time slots. Available time slots comprise time slots in the indicated time period that do not include one scheduled event as indicated in the scheduled event records. At least one bid for the service is received for one available time slot in which the service is to be performed, wherein the bid indicates an amount. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In further implementations, in response to an expiration of the bidding period, a determination is made of at least one bid having a most favorable amount. The determined at least one bid is accepted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Still further, the request for bids may further indicate a requested frequency indicating a number of multiple bids that will be accepted for the time period indicated in the bid. In such case, in response to an expiration of the bidding period, a determination is made of up to the indicated number of bids having amounts higher than the amounts for other bids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In one implementation, the user is requesting service providers to bid to provide the service during at least one available time slot within the indicated time period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In a further implementation, the user is a service provider requesting that clients bid for the user to provide the service during available time slots. In such case, in response to an expiration of the bidding period, a determination is made of one bid in each available time slot having the highest bid amount if there is at least one bid submitted for the time slot. Each bid having the highest bid amount in each available time slot is accepted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The described implementations provide a technique for using a user&apos;s scheduled event records maintained in a personal information manager (PM) calendar system with an auction system, such that the auction system only allows bids to be submitted for time slots that do not conflict with the user&apos;s already scheduled events recorded in the PIM system.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In the following description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and which illustrate several embodiments of the present invention. It is understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural and operational changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates a wireless computing environment in which embodiments of the invention are implemented. A wireless device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, such as a telephony device, e.g., cellular phone, personal digital assistant (PDA), band held computer, palm computer, etc., communicates with a server <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> via a communication tower <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, gateway server <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, and network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The server <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> may comprise one or more server class machines known in the art. The wireless device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> includes a communication layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which converts digital data into a signal that is transmitted to the communication tower <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> in a manner known in the art. The gateway server <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> converts the signals back into digital data to transmit via network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the server <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may comprise any collection of devices, routers, etc. used to transmit data to a centralized server <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> providing data management for the wireless device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> operations. The communication tower <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and communication layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may implement any known wireless transmission technology known in the art such as 3G, Code-Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), satellite, Bluetooth, etc.** <footnote id="FOO-00001">**Bluetooth is a trademark of Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson. </footnote></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The wireless device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> further includes locator technology <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> that provides a current position coordinate of the wireless device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in three dimensional space (x, y, z) on the surface of the earth and the time the position coordinate was generated. The locator <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may comprise a global position satellite (GPS) receiver that is capable of calculating a current position based upon signals sent from satellites in a manner known in the art. Alternatively, the location of the wireless device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be estimated externally from the wireless device by measuring the transmissions from the wireless device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> using any known location positioning technology in a manner known in the art, such as Enhanced Observed Time Differential (E-OTD), Time Of Arrival (TOA), the CellPoint positioning system, the Ericsson Mobile Positioning System, etc.** In fact the U.S. Federal Communication Commission (FCC) mandated that cellular phone manufacturers incorporate technology to allow the location of the wireless device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to be determined. Any reference to the locator <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> refers to the locator technology used within the wireless device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> that enables a position determination. For instance, if the locator <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> comprises a GPS receiver, then the locator <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> itself may determine the actual position coordinate. Alternatively, the locator <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may provide information to an external component to enable the external component to determine the position coordinate of the wireless device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. <footnote id="FOO-00002">**Bluetooth is a trademark of Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson. </footnote></paragraph>

In the described implementations, the PIM client <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> periodically generates a measured position record <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> by obtaining the measured position coordinate (x, y, z) and the current time from the locator <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (which may, in certain implementation interact with external components to provide the location and position coordinate). The location description <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> may be obtained locally at the wireless device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or determined subsequently by the server <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> as described in the following implementations. </paragraph>

An access level field <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> indicates which users can be allowed to use the location record <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> to determine information about a location. The public location record <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> has public level access such that the PIM server <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can consider a public location record <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> for any user in the PIM database <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. A user location record <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> can only be considered for the particular user that defined the location record <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and any other authorized users in the system, as indicated by the access level <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. A geographic boundary field <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> defines a boundary of a defined region in three dimensional space. A location description field <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> provides a description of the location, which may include text, images, sound, movies, etc. A company maintaining the server <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, such as a telecommunication service provider, can use satellite maps and other information to determine the geographic boundaries in three dimensional space of various buildings and businesses. Business could register their geographic boundaries.

<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The user specified location records <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are generated by the user to provide information to include with the user&apos;s calendar. For instance, the user may obtain from a third party, such as a mapping company or organization, the geographic boundaries of an office or building and provide geographic boundary and location description information to the server <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to include in a user location record <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. In another implementation, the user can activate a geographic boundary definition mode on the wireless device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to record position coordinates of a geographic boundary using the locator <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. In this geographic boundary definition mode, the user may walk or otherwise travel around a geographic area. While moving through the geographic area, the wireless device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> would determine the x, y, z position coordinates at frequent intervals using the locator <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The PIM client <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> or PIM server <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can then use the determined position coordinates to determine a geographic boundary bounding all of the coordinates generated in the geographic boundary definition mode. This determined geographic boundary would then be included in the geographic boundary field <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> of the eventual user defined location record <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> stored in the user records <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in the database <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> To provide data to the PIM server <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the PIM client <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> performs steps <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> in interval time periods, e.g., every few seconds, minute, etc., to measure the current location and generate measured position records <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. At block <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, the PIM client <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> initiates a location request to the locator <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> or other unit to determine the current position coordinate (x, y, z) of the wireless device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Upon receiving (at block <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>) the position coordinate from the locator <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the PIM client <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> determines (at block <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight>) whether the received position coordinate falls within any predefined geographic boundaries supplied by a location transmitter <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, the PIM server <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, a user defined location record <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, or any other geographical boundary maintained by the PIM client <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>.

In the event that the PIM client <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> executes the filtering algorithms, then the PIM client <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> would transmit the filtered position records <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to the PIM server <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> to store in the PIM database <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> With respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, control begins at block <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> with the invocation of the filtering algorithm for the user records <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of a particular user. A loop is performed from blocks <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> for each measured position record i in the user records <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> that has not yet been subject to filtering to add location description information <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> to the measured position record <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> if such data was not provided by the PIM client <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. If (at block <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>) the measured position record i does not include any location description <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> data, then a determination is made (at block <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>) as to whether the position coordinate <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> data in record i is within the geographic boundary of any user defined location records <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the user being considered. If so, then the location description <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> for the user defined location record <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is added (at block <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>) to the location description <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> data for the measured position record <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. If (at block <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>) a geographic boundary was not located in the user defined location records <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, then a determination is made (at block <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>) whether the position coordinate <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> data in record i is within the geographic boundary of any public location records <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. If so, then the location description <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> for the public location record <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is added (at block <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>) to the location description <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> data for the measured position record <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. From the yes branch of block <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> (if there is already location information added by the PIM client <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>) or from blocks <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, control proceeds to block <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> to consider all the measured position records <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> for the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> After the measured position records <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> are supplemented with location information from user defined <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> or public <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> location records, then control proceeds to blocks <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> to generate the filtered position records <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> that are particularly suited for use in a PIM or calendaring program. At block <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>, the filter scans from the first user position record <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> to determine ranges of consecutive position records <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> having the same location description <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> spanning a time period exceeding a minimum time period. Thus, the filter is looking for position records indicating that the user was at a same location for a minimum time. The minimum time may be a time period of sufficient length that would be meaningful to display in a PIM interface, such as a calendar or schedule, e.g., <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> minutes, etc. For each determined range of records, a filtered position record <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is generated (at block <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>) having a date <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and time <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> ranges from the date and time of the first to last position records in the determined range and having a location description <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> that is the common location description <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> found in the position records <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> in the determined range.

<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> At block <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, activity algorithms may then be applied to those position records not consolidated into filtered position records <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> at block <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>. An activity algorithm would analyze a series of consecutive measured position records and based on a rate of change in distance per unit of time, determine a predefined activity associated with the position records. For instance, a range of consecutive measured position records <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> whose position coordinate <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> (x, y, z) is rapidly changing may indicate that the user is traveling in an automobile or other transportation vehicle. Other rate of changes may indicate other activities, e.g., walking, running, bicycle riding, etc. For each determined range of measured position records <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> that define an activity, a filtered position record <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is generated (at block <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>) having a date <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and time <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> ranges from the date <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and time <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of the first and last measured position records <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> in the range and an activity description field <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> set to the activity determined for the range. The geographic location field <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may comprise a range of first and last locations for the activity, wherein the first location would comprise the location <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> data from the first measured position record <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> in the range for the activity and the last location would comprise the location data <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> from the last record <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> in the range. Thus, in certain described implementations, a filtered position record <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> indicates a time period during which a user was at a location, defined by a geographic boundary or a time period during which the user was engaged in an activity involving movement from one location to another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The filtered position records <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are then stored (at block <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>) in the PIM database <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> for later use. The filtered position records <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> provide more useful descriptive information than the measured position records <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> because they indicate time periods spent at meaningful geographic locations or engagement in a particular activity. </paragraph>

Otherwise, if the viewer or browser requesting the calendar information includes a larger display area, then the PIM server <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> generates (at block <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight>) one or more HTML pages including the presentation of the generated calendar information. From blocks <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight>, control transfers to block <highlight><bold>366</bold></highlight> to transmit the generated web pages to the browser requesting that page. Alternatively, the PIM server <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may include the generated calendar information in an Extensible Markup Language (XML) or other file that is sent to the PIM client <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to render on the local display. Thus, the calendar information presented to the user may include a description of user scheduled events as well as information on the geographical locations the user associated with the wireless device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> visited during the specified time interval. </paragraph>

In this way, the user may compare what was scheduled with what actually materialized. Moreover, in implementations where the PIM server <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> updates the user calendar information in real time and generates real time filtered position records, the calendar <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> could display the user&apos;s current geographical location. This information could be useful for business associates and others interested in the user&apos;s location. Additionally, the actual location/activity <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> may be displayed in an abbreviated format. The user may use an input device to selectively display further details on the actual location/activity. For instance, the user may move a mouse input device over the displayed abbreviation of the actual location/activity or click the displayed abbreviation to cause the display of more detailed information on the actual location/activity in the calendar window <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> illustrates an implementation of a bid request form <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> that a user of the PIM system would use to enter the parameters to allow service providers to bid for a requested service as part of a reverse auction. The PIM server <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may include a HyperText Markup Language (HIML) implementation of the bid request form <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> to transmit to users to allow users to provide the PIM server <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> with information to implement a reverse auction. The user may specify a time period <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> and a requested service <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> for the time period, as well as a frequency <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> that the user wants the service performed. The user may select the view calendar button <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> to display the schedule for the time period specified in field <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> and edit the displayed calendar time periods to block off further time slots to preclude bidding during such time slots or open other time slots for bids. Once the user has finalized the calendar submitted with the bid request, the user would submit the bid request parameters and the user calendar information for the period to the PIM server <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to use to implement an auction and accept bids for the requested service. </paragraph>

The electronic bulletin board may be accessible over the Internet or on a private network The PIM server <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may display a summary of user bid request postings that the bidders may select and review. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> illustrates an example of a bid submittal form <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight> the PIM server <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> would generate and provide to bidders to use to review the nature of the auction and submit bids. The bidders may access the bid submittal form through a web based interface, such as a HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) server, using a web client, such as an Internet browser. The PIM server <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> would transmit an HTML page implementing the bid submittal form <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight> to enable bidders to submit bids. The PIM server <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may periodically refresh the bid submittal form <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight> to update bid information. The bid submittal form <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight> displays a calendar of time slots based on the modified scheduled event records <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, b . . . n </italic></highlight>submitted by the user, such that a &ldquo;BUSY&rdquo; block is displayed for the time period specified in each modified scheduled event record <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, b . . . n </italic></highlight>provided with the bid request <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>. If the user specified that bids may be submitted across multiple days, then the HTML form implementing the bid submittal form <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight> would display buttons <highlight><bold>572</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>574</bold></highlight> to allow the service provider to view calendar displays for further days or time slots that do not fit in the view. The HTML implementation of the bid submittal form <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight> further displays information on the requested service and the frequency of the service requested <highlight><bold>576</bold></highlight>. The bid submittal form <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight> further displays a scroll bar <highlight><bold>578</bold></highlight> to allow the service provider to view additional time slots. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, the bid submittal form displays bids submitted by different service providers for a specified time period. Note that multiple bids submitted for the requested service are displayed in the time slots. The service provider may enter a bid through the bid submittal form <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight> by selecting a time slot in the HTML implementation of the bid submittal form displayed in the service provider&apos;s computer web browser. In response to selection of the time slot, the PIM server <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> would transmit a further HTML template to display a dialog box in which the bidder may enter the bid parameters and transmit such bid parameters back to the PIM server <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> illustrates an example of a bid submittal data structure <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> the PIM server <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> would generate in response to bid parameters the bidder would enter and transmit back to the PIM server <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The bid submittal data structure <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> the PIM server <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> generates from the information provided by the bidder includes: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Bid Request ID <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>: Unique identifier of the bid request submitted by the user and assigned to the bid request data <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> to associate a submitted bid with a bid request. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Date and Time Slot <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>: indicates the date and time slot for which the bid is submitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Bid Amount <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight>: indicates the amount of the submitted bid </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Bidder ID <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight>: comprises a unique ID of the person or entity submitting the bid, which may comprise a user ID in the PIM database <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> if the person submitting the bid has user records <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in the PIM database <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The PIM server <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> would maintain the bid submittal records <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> for each bid request ID <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> to generate the display of the bid submittal form <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight> including submitted bids. After the bidding period expires, which may comprise a default or user specified period of time for receiving bid requests, the entity submitting the highest bid is allowed to provide the service to the user requesting the bid. If the user requesting bids has indicated that they would like to purchase multiple instances of the service, i.e., the frequency of service is greater than one, then the highest submitted bids would be selected to provide instances of the requested service at the requested frequency level. For instance, if the user requested the service once a week during the time period, then the highest bid for time slots in each week in the time period would be selected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The above implementation was for a reverse auction where service providers submitted bids to provide a service to the user based on the user&apos;s availability as determined by the scheduled event records <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) in the user records <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in the PIM database <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. In further implementations, the above described GUI panels and data structures may be used to allow a service provider to request bids to auction off their own time in a direct auction. For instance, the service provider may have available time slots in their calendar during which they can provide a service, e.g., legal consulting, financial consulting, physical therapy, psychological counseling, etc. The service provider would be a use of the PIM database having scheduled event records <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> defining their scheduled calendar events. The service provider would use the request for bids form <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>) and select the &ldquo;Any Available Time&rdquo; value <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> as the frequency of service to allow others to bid for their time at any available time slot on the calendar during normal business hours. The requested service <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> would comprise the service the service provider offers. The service provider may then select the view calendar <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> button to further modify the available slots that will be displayed in the template <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Those interested in scheduling time with the service provider user of the database may use the bid submittal form <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight> to submit a bid for a time slot to purchase the service provided. At the end of the bidding period, if there are multiple bids for a time slot, the person submitting the highest bid for a time slot is awarded the service at the requested time, which is the most favorable bid in the context of a direct auction. Moreover, the user submitting the bid request may request a minimum or maximum bid amount. For instance, in the case of the reverse auction requesting that service providers submit bids, the user may specify a maximum amount for any bid. Further, in the case of a direct auction requesting bids to purchase time from a service provider, the service provider may specify a minimum bid amount for the service. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> illustrates logic implemented in the PIM server <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to determine those bids to accept for a bid request <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>. Control begins at block <highlight><bold>650</bold></highlight> when the bidding period expires for one bid request <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>) . In response, the PIM server <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> determines all bid submittal records <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>) having the expired bid request ID <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>. The frequency of service <highlight><bold>556</bold></highlight> is determined (at block <highlight><bold>654</bold></highlight>). If (at block <highlight><bold>656</bold></highlight>) the requested frequency of service is &ldquo;any available time&rdquo;, then for each available calendar time slot in the specified time range <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight>, the PIM server <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> determines (at block <highlight><bold>658</bold></highlight>) the bid submittal records <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> having the highest bid amount <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight>. All the determined bid submittal records <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> are stored (at block <highlight><bold>660</bold></highlight>) in the PIM database <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> as accepted bids in the user records <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) of the user submitting the bid request <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>. The PIM server <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> further notifies (at block <highlight><bold>662</bold></highlight>) each bidder whose bid is accepted of the bid acceptance and the user submitting the bid request <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> of the accepted bids. Those whose bids were not accepted may also be notified. The execution of the transfer may then be handled directly between the bidder and bid requester, and the exchange of payment may occur through a clearinghouse or through a direct transaction between the bidder and bid requester. The &ldquo;any available time&rdquo; frequency would be used by service providers to open their schedule to allow clients to bid for available time slots in a direct auction of their time. In certain implementations, those bidding would be capable of viewing all previously submitted bids in the bid submittal template <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> If (at block <highlight><bold>664</bold></highlight>) the frequency of service <highlight><bold>556</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>) is &ldquo;one time&rdquo;, then the PIM server <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> determines the bid submittal record <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> having the most favorable bid amount <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> (which in reverse auctions is the lowest bid and in direct auctions is the highest bid) and proceeds to block <highlight><bold>660</bold></highlight> to store the determined highest bid and notify the bidder and bid requestor of the auction results. If the frequency of service <highlight><bold>556</bold></highlight> is some other value, e.g., once a week, every day, once a month, etc., then the PIM server <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> determines (at block <highlight><bold>668</bold></highlight>) the highest submitted bids within the specified frequency within the calendar time period, highest submitted bid each day, once a week, once a month, etc., and proceeds to block <highlight><bold>660</bold></highlight> to complete the auction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The described implementations provide a technique to integrate a user&apos;s calendar of scheduled events into a bid submittal request where the available time slots for which bids may be received are based on the available time between calendar scheduled events. In this way, the PIM calendar is extended to implement an auction where the PIM user can request bids for a service in a reverse auction or direct auction for the service. </paragraph>
