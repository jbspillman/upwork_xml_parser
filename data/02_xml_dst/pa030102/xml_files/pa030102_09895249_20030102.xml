<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a power hand drill and, more specifically, to the arrangement of a power hand drill outer shell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A conventional power hand drill is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, comprising a torque adjusting mechanism <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> between the chuck <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the transmission gear box <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The torque adjusting mechanism <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> comprises a rotary torque adjustment ring <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> disposed adjacent to the chuck <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a torque control (not shown), and a cover shell <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> covering the torque control. The housing <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the power hand drill covers the cover shell <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and other movable members of the power hand drill except the chuck <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the rotary torque adjustment ring <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The housing <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is provided with a sliding slot <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> in which a sliding switch <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is installed to control the transmission gear box <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. This design of housing for power hand drill has drawbacks as outlined hereinafter: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> 1. When inspecting or repairing the internal torque control, the housing must be detached from the power hand drill so that the cover shell and the transmission gear box can be opened for a maintenance work. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> 2. Because the housing covers over the cover shell of the torque adjusting mechanism, the front side of the housing must be tapered to fit the periphery of the cover shell, however this limitation complicates the fabrication of the housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> 3. During the operation of the torque control, much heat is produced, however the plastic housing is a barrier to the dissipation of heat. Accumulation of heat inside the housing may damage the internal mechanism of the power hand drill. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> 4. The housing is not suitable for the installation of an external lamp for enabling the power hand drill to be used in the dark. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been accomplished under the circumstances in view. It is the main object of the present invention to provide a power hand drill outer shell arrangement, which eliminates the drawbacks of the aforesaid conventional design. According to one aspect of the present invention, the power hand drill outer shell arrangement of the present invention comprises a metal cover shell, the cover shell having equiangularly spaced peripheral lugs and an integrated switch seat holding a transmission gear box control switch; and a housing abutted against the cover shell, the housing having axially extended mounting holes respectively fastened to the peripheral lugs of the cover shell, and a front opening, which receives the switch seat. Because the housing is abutted against the cover shell but not covering the cover shell, it is not necessary to have the front side of the housing tapered, and the housing is not a barrier to the dissipation of heat to the metal cover shell. Therefore, the fabrication of the housing is simple. According to another aspect of the present invention, the housing further comprises a receiving hole remote from the front opening, and a lamp unit hinged to the peripheral wall of the receiving hole and turned between an operative position outside the receiving hole and a non-operative position inside the receiving hole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The foregoing object and summary provide only a brief introduction to the present invention. To fully appreciate these and other objects of the present invention as well as the invention itself, all of which will become apparent to those skilled in the art, the following detailed description of the invention and the claims should be read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. Throughout the specification and drawings identical reference numerals refer to identical or similar parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Many other advantages and features of the present invention will become manifest to those versed in the art upon making reference to the detailed description and the accompanying sheets of drawings in which a preferred structural embodiment incorporating the principles of the present invention is shown by way of illustrative example. </paragraph>
