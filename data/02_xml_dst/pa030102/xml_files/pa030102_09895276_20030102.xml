<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to automotive braking systems. More particularly, the brake assembly of the present invention includes a combined hydraulic service brake and electric park brake feature, which eliminates the need for a separate parking brake and associated structure. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In conventional automotive braking systems the service brake and the parking/emergency brake are separate systems. The service brake is used for normal braking function during operation of the vehicle. The service brake typically includes a master cylinder that converts a manual exertion of force on a brake pedal into an increase of hydraulic pressure. The hydraulic pressure acts on a remote wheel cylinder or slave cylinder causing a brake pad to be applied to an associated rotor connected to a wheel of the vehicle, thus slowing the vehicle. Conventional park brakes are typically engaged when the vehicle operator pulls a lever or depresses a pedal connected to the park brake by a steel cable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Hydraulic brakes are generally not used as parking brakes because hydraulic fluid under constant pressure has a tendency to leak past seals of a hydraulic brake system over time resulting in a decrease in fluid pressure, which would cause the brake to release its hold on the rotor. Therefore, this inadequacy of the hydraulic brake for use as a parking brake has required the existence of two separate braking systems to fulfill the needs of a vehicle operator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It would be desirable to have a brake system that would improve on the existing brake system. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The ball screw assembly <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can include a screw member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and a piston <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, which can be hollow, defining the nut portion of the ball screw assembly <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The hollow piston <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may have, for example, a cylindrical shape. In one embodiment, the hollow piston <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may include a grooved inside wall portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The screw member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> can be generally H-shaped having an axial opening <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and a grooved outer wall portion <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The grooved inner wall portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of hollow piston <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> can be positioned adjacent to or along the grooved outer wall portion <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of screw member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to form, in one embodiment, a ball race, including ball bearings <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Ball screw assembly <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may have an anti-rotation feature (not shown) that prevents rotation of the hollow piston <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> thereby allowing the hollow piston <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to maintain a linear motion. In one embodiment the anti-rotation feature may be positioned between the hollow piston <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and brake pad (not shown) and may comprise an anti-rotation clip attached to the back of the brake pad which fits into an axial groove in the hollow piston. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In a second embodiment, illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, there can be a threaded engagement between hollow piston <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> and screw member <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the inner wall <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> of hollow piston <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> can be threaded and the outer wall <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> of the screw member <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> can be similarly threaded and engaged with the inner wall threads so that the threads cooperate in such a manner that the rotation of the screw member <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> linearly moves the hollow piston <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. An axial opening of the screw member <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> is shown at <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Returning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> driving member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can be positioned centrally within the caliper housing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The driving member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can be positioned within the caliper housing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> through an axial opening <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> in the closed end <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of the caliper housing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and through an axial opening (not shown) of plate <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. Driving member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may include a driving extension or extending portion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> that extends through the axial opening <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of screw member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>.

Alternatively, the driving portion may have a non-square cross-section such as, for example, a rectangular, oval, or splined configuration with a corresponding complimentary axial opening of screw member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The driving member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can include a central bore <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> opposite the driving portion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. A drive shaft (not shown) of transmission <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> can be inserted into the central bore <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> of driving member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and can be suitably connected to driving member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> by fastener <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. Fastener <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> can be a setscrew. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> A bearing <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> with an axial opening can be positioned adjacent to the inside wall <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> of the closed end <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of caliper housing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> so that the axial opening of the bearing <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> corresponds with the axial opening <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of the closed end <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of the caliper housing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and through which the driving member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can be inserted. The bearing <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> may be a thrust needle bearing. The invention contemplates any sort of suitable arrangement of bushings and/or bearings that reduces the friction between the screw member and the inside wall of the caliper housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> A first seal <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> can be positioned between the driving member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and the caliper housing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The first seal <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> may be an O-ring made of suitable material such as rubber. This first seal may be positioned to prevent the loss of hydraulic fluid from the fluid chamber between the driving member and the caliper housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> A second seal <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> can be positioned between the caliper housing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the hollow piston <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The second seal <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may be an O-ring made of suitable material such as rubber. The second seal <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may be positioned to prevent the loss of hydraulic fluid from the fluid chamber between the hollow piston and the caliper housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> A third seal <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> can be positioned within the hollow piston <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to prevent the loss of hydraulic fluid from the fluid chamber between the hollow piston and the screw member. The third seal can be held in place within the hollow piston using a ring <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The ring <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be a snap ring fitted within a groove <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> cut into the inner wall <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of hollow piston <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the third seal may be a seal disc composed of a tool steel to suit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In operation of the hydraulic brake during normal driving conditions, the vehicle operator actuates the brake system in a known manner resulting in an increase of hydraulic fluid pressure in one or more brake lines leading to the assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The increase in pressure of the hydraulic fluid in the brake line results in an increase of fluid in the fluid chamber <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of the brake assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The increase of hydraulic fluid in the fluid chamber <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> can cause the ball screw assembly <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and piston <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to move linearly (laterally in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) within the caliper housing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The lateral movement of the ball screw assembly <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> causes the hollow piston <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> portion of the ball screw assembly <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to engage a rotor (not shown) in a known manner to slow the vehicle. Conversely, the release of the brake pedal by the vehicle operator decreases the hydraulic fluid pressure within the fluid chamber <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> resulting in release of an associated rotor, allowing the rotor to move. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In operation of the electric park brake portion of the brake assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the vehicle operator can engage the park brake (not shown) by some suitable means such as by a switch, lever, button or remote control. Alternatively, a control device, such as an electronic brake control module or computer of the vehicle can engage the park brake automatically when the vehicle is turned off or put into park. The electric motor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is activated, rotating the transmission <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> to rotate a transmission drive shaft or the like (not shown) that can be connected to the driving member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. It will be understood that transmission <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> can be any suitable device for transmitting output from the motor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, such as, for example, a set of meshed gears, chains and sprockets, pulleys and belts and the like. The rotation of the transmission <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> can rotate the driving member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The rotation of the driving member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can result in the rotation of screw member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the ball screw assembly <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The ball groove connection between the screw member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the hollow piston <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> translates the rotational movement of the screw member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> into linear movement of the hollow piston <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The linear movement of the hollow piston <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> causes the hollow piston to move associated brake pads to engage a rotor in a similar manner as that via the hydraulic brake system described above. The brake pads remain held against the rotor until such time when the non-backdriveable transmission is reversed by the motor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As described above, the assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> provides a number of advantages, some of which have been described above and others of which are inherent in the invention. Also modifications may be proposed without departing from the teachings herein. Accordingly the scope of the invention is only to be limited as necessitated by the accompanying claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> While the embodiments of the invention disclosed herein are presently considered to be preferred, various changes and modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. The scope of the invention is indicated in the appended claims, and all changes that come within the meaning and range of equivalents are intended to be embraced therein. </paragraph>
