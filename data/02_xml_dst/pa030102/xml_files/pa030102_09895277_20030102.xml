<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates in general to wireless communication and more specifically to a system, apparatus and method for providing wireless communication service within a building. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Communication systems provide a variety of voice, multimedia, data and other services to users. Several conventional communications systems provide wireless services to users through an infrastructure using an arrangement of base stations where each base station transmits and receives signals to and from one or more mobile stations. The quality of the communication links between the mobile stations and the base stations are effected by a variety of mechanisms. For example, obstacles within the communication area may cause interference and fading. Among other undesirable situations, these mechanisms result in noisy connections, limited data throughput, dropped calls and areas having extremely limited or no communication service. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Conventional systems are particularly limited in providing communications services within building structures. The configurations of buildings coupled with construction materials such as steel and concrete prevent uniform distribution of radio signals within buildings. Communication links between mobile stations within a building and an external base station are often susceptible to high losses, interference and fading. As a result, users within a building experience the problems discussed above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> One attempt to improve in-building wireless service includes installing base stations within the building and establishing wireless service coverage to various floors through cables or wires. A base station such as Base Transceiver Station (BTS) can be installed within a building and connected to an external network through copper wire or fiber optic cable. The radio frequency (RF) output of the base station is distributed throughout the building using a radiating cable or a distributed antenna infrastructure. Signals transmitted by the mobile stations are received at the base station through the passive cable infrastructure or antennas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Conventional systems utilizing such an arrangement, however, have several drawbacks. Installation of these systems typically accounts for 60-80 percent of the total cost. In addition to routing cables on each floor, cables must be routed between floors often requiring expensive drilling and patching of fire barriers. Installation must typically occur at night resulting in premium labor and additional security costs. Further, conventional system implementation result in inefficient use of equipment since a sophisticated BTS is most often dedicated to an entire building and the full user capacity of the BTS is rarely needed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Additional drawbacks result in systems where the signals are routed using RF cabling such as coaxial cables between the floors. The numerous couplings at each floor and high cable loss result in low power levels at the floors furthest from the base station. The power amplifiers of the base stations must be operated at high power in order to compensate for the losses. In addition, signals received from mobile stations on the remote floors experience low signal to noise ratios (SNR). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Other attempts at providing in-building wireless service include installing a broadband bidirectional amplifier (BDA) that communicates with an external BTS through a wireless communication channel and provides in-building coverage through a cabled antenna network. In addition to some of the drawbacks discussed above, these active cable systems have several limitations. For example, the BDA requires a high quality communication link to the external BTS often requiring careful alignment of antennas. Also, since the BDAs are typically installed near the highest point of the building, the signals from more than one BTS may reach the BDA. In addition to issues related to interference, small changes in antenna alignment or location often result in frequent handoffs between base stations as the system evaluates the various signals and revises the preferred BTS for establishing the communication link. For example, a user with a mobile station traveling on an upper floor of a building may pass through several coverage areas of several base stations due to the line of sight propagation of signals at the high altitude. As the user moves along the floor, the mobile station experiences frequent handoffs between base stations as a result of typical handoff procedures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Therefore, there is a need for an efficient method, apparatus and system for providing uniform wireless service within a building structure.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a method, apparatus and system provides uniform wireless service within a building structure. A building interface station provides a communication link between a base station and one or more distribution stations. In accordance with the exemplary embodiment, the distribution stations are located within the building structure and provide an interface between interior mobile stations within the building and the building interface station. Wireless distribution signals are exchanged between the building interface station and the distribution stations while corresponding wireless coverage signals are exchanged between the distribution stations and interior mobile stations. In the exemplary embodiment, the building interface station communicates with interior mobiles both directly and through the distribution stations. In the exemplary embodiment, therefore, the building interface station and the distribution stations form an in-building simulcast communication system with a wireless backhaul. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Installation costs are greatly reduced since the in-building wireless backhaul does not require the installation of involved cable networks as in conventional systems. The locations of the distribution stations can be strategically chosen to allow for uniform wireless service on a floor within the building. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, wireless service to interior mobile stations within a building structure is significantly less than optimum in conventional cellular systems. In conventional cellular communication systems, each of a plurality of cellular base stations provides wireless service to mobile stations within a base station coverage region in the vicinity of the cellular base station. The base station coverage regions are often partitioned into sectors, where a dedicated set of frequencies is used for communicating with mobile stations within the sector. A convenient frequency allocation plan includes partitioning the base station coverage region into three sectors and dedicating four frequencies for downstream communication and four frequencies for upstream communication per sector. Time division multiplexing (TDM) techniques are used to provide eight time slots per frequency where at least one time slot within a sector is reserved for control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a block diagram of a wireless communication system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in accordance with the exemplary embodiment of the invention. Although the present invention may be utilized in accordance with a variety of communication systems, modulation techniques, and protocols, the wireless communication system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is implemented as part of a GSM cellular system. In the exemplary embodiment, the communication system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is integrated in accordance with an infrastructure having one or more interface stations <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> that communicate with the base interface station <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> to provide wireless service to mobile stations <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. Such an infrastructure is described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 5,787,344 issued to Stefan Scheinert on Jul. 28, 1998, entitled &ldquo;Arrangement of Base Transceiver Stations of an Area-Covering Network&rdquo;, and is incorporated by reference herein. In the interest of brevity, therefore, only a general overview of a suitable infrastructure utilizing a plurality of interface stations <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> to provide wireless service to mobile stations <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is discussed below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In the exemplary embodiment, a base interface station <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is connected to each cellular base station <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of a cellular communication system. The base interface station <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is connected to a cellular base station <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> that is part of a conventional GSM cellular system to form a base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The cellular base station <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is shown as a block having a dashed line to illustrate that the base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> may be single integrated unit. Therefore, the cellular base station <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may be a separate device from the base interface station <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> or the base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> may be a single integrated unit having the functionality of the base interface station <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and the cellular base station <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> as described herein. The cellular base station <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is likely to be separate from the base interface station <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> where a simulcast communication system with interface stations <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is integrated with an existing cellular infrastructure and the base interface station <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is connected to an existing cellular base station <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Those skilled in the art, however, will recognize the various suitable configurations of the base interface station <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and the cellular base station <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and implementations of the base stations (<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>,) in accordance with the teachings herein. For example, the functionality of the base interface station <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> can be implemented in a cellular base station <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> by modifying a conventional cellular base station or manufacturing an integrated base station that functions as both a cellular base station <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and a base interface station <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. Further, the base interface station <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and the cellular base station <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> can be co-located or can be in different locations. In the exemplary embodiment, the base interface station <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is connected to the cellular base station <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> through a coaxial cable. Communication and control signals, however, can be transmitted between the two units (<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>) using a cable, radio frequency link, microwave link or any other type of wired or wireless communication channel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Each cellular base station <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> communicates over a coaxial cable with the corresponding base interface station <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> using a set of communication frequencies allocated to the base station coverage region of the base station <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The base interface station <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> communicates with several interface stations <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> within a sector over a link channel <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> using a set of link frequencies. The base station coverage regions of the base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> are partitioned into sectors, where a dedicated set of frequencies is used for communicating with mobile stations <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> within the sector. A suitable frequency allocation plan includes partitioning the base station coverage region into three sectors and dedicating four frequencies for downstream communication and four frequencies for upstream communication per sector. Time division multiplexing (TDM) techniques are used to provide eight time slots per frequency where at least one time slot within a sector is reserved for control and system management functions. Each of the interface stations <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> within a particular sector uses the set of coverage frequencies allocated to the particular sector to communicate with one or more mobile stations <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> over a coverage channel <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. In the exemplary embodiment, wireless service is not provided directly by the base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to the mobile stations <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the frequency allocation scheme may be modified to meet the requirements of a particular base station coverage area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In the downstream communication path, downstream information is transmitted at a downstream coverage frequency to the base interface station <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, frequency shifted to a downstream link frequency and transmitted to several interface stations <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> within a sector. Each of the interface stations <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> frequency shifts the received signals and transmits the downstream information at the appropriate downstream coverage frequency to one or more mobile stations <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> using simulcast techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In the upstream direction, a mobile station <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> transmits upstream information to one or more exterior interface stations <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> at an upstream coverage frequency. Each exterior interface station <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> frequency shifts the received signal to an upstream link frequency and transmits the upstream information at the upstream coverage frequency to the base interface station <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. The base interface station <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> shifts the signal to an upstream coverage frequency and forwards the upstream signal to the cellular base station <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> where it is processed in accordance with conventional cellular communication techniques. Other details and advantages are further discussed in the referenced patent application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the exemplary embodiment of the invention, a building interface station <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> communicates with the base interface station <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> to provide wireless service to interior mobile stations <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> within the building structure. A wireless link channel <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> for communication between the base interface station <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and the building interface station <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> uses frequencies different from the frequencies that are used to establish coverage channels <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> between the base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and mobile stations <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> within the base station coverage region of the cellular base station <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. As described above, the cellular base station <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> communicates with the mobile stations <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> through the base interface station <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> in the exemplary embodiment. The base interface station <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> utilizes one or more frequencies within a frequency band typically dictated by a radio spectrum licensing authority such as the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). As is known, frequency allocation schemes that limit the use of particular base stations to a subset of the frequencies within the frequency band are typically used to maximize frequency reuse and efficiently use the available frequencies within the frequency band. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The building interface station <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> communicates with the distribution stations <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> through a wireless distribution channel <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> using one or more frequencies different from any frequency used in the interior coverage channel <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> for communicating with the interior mobile stations <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. The distribution stations <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> communicate with the interior mobile stations <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> on the inside of the building <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> through the interior coverage channel <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> using at least one frequency in common with the frequencies used in the exterior coverage channel <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. In the exemplary embodiment, however, the interior coverage channel <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> includes the same frequencies as the exterior coverage channel <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. In any particular situation, some interior mobile stations <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may communicate exclusively with a building interface station <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> while other mobile stations <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> communicate exclusively through a distribution station <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. In other situations, an interior mobile station <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> may communicate both directly with the building interface station <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and through one or more distribution stations <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. Therefore, downstream signals are simulcast at the downstream coverage frequency from the building interface station and one or more distribution stations <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. An upstream signal transmitted by an interior mobile station <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is received through one or more distribution stations <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and the building interface station <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The following upstream and downstream examples illustrate one suitable allocation of frequencies in accordance with the exemplary embodiment. In the following examples, frequencies are indicated by F<highlight><subscript>up</subscript></highlight>(x) and F<highlight><subscript>dn</subscript></highlight>(x) where each value of x identifies a single frequency or set of frequencies independent and distinct from frequencies identified by any another value of x. Therefore, although the following examples refer to the frequencies as single frequencies, those skilled in the art will recognize that sets of frequencies can be chosen having the same relationships as single frequencies allowing for frequency management where the various signals can be transmitted on any one of frequencies within a frequency set. F<highlight><subscript>up </subscript></highlight>indicates an upstream frequency while F<highlight><subscript>dn </subscript></highlight>indicates a downstream frequency. In systems using Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) techniques such as Time Division Duplex (TDD), F<highlight><subscript>up </subscript></highlight>(x) may be the same single frequency as F<highlight><subscript>dn </subscript></highlight>(x) for any given x. In Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) and other systems, F<highlight><subscript>up </subscript></highlight>(x) does not represent a single frequency that is the same as a single frequency, F<highlight><subscript>dn</subscript></highlight>(x), for any given x. The notation F<highlight><subscript>up </subscript></highlight>(x) for these systems identifies either a single frequency or set of frequencies that is/are different from a single frequency or set of frequencies identified by F<highlight><subscript>dn </subscript></highlight>(x) for a particular x. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Downstream signals are processed and transmitted through the communication system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and received at the mobile stations <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. A signal that is to be transmitted to an interior mobile station <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is received at the base interface station <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> from the cellular base station <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> at frequency F<highlight><subscript>dn</subscript></highlight>(<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). For this example, F<highlight><subscript>dn</subscript></highlight>(<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) can also be used by the base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> for communicating with the exterior mobile stations <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> within the cellular base station service region. In the exemplary embodiment, the downstream signal is transmitted as an RF signal having a frequency of F<highlight><subscript>dn</subscript></highlight>(<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) from the cellular base station <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> through a cable to the base interface station <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. The base interface station <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> frequency shifts the downstream signal from F<highlight><subscript>dn</subscript></highlight>(<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) to F<highlight><subscript>dn</subscript></highlight>(<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) where F<highlight><subscript>dn</subscript></highlight>(<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) is within the frequency band used by the communication system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The base interface station <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> transmits the resulting downstream link signal (at F<highlight><subscript>dn</subscript></highlight>(<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>)) to the building interface station <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The building interface station <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> frequency shifts the downstream link signal to another frequency, F<highlight><subscript>dn</subscript></highlight>(<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>), that is within the frequency band but that is not the same as any frequency of the signals transmitted within the building structure <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The building interface station <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> transmits the resulting downstream distribution signal at F<highlight><subscript>dn</subscript></highlight>(<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) to one or more distribution stations <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> through the wireless distribution channel <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. The distribution station <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> shifts the distribution signal to F<highlight><subscript>dn</subscript></highlight>(<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) before transmitting the resulting downstream interior signal to the mobile station <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the interior coverage signals transmitted within the interior wireless coverage channel <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> can have the same frequencies as the frequencies used by the wireless exterior coverage channel <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> within the base station coverage region used for communicating with the exterior mobile stations <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The building interface station <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> also frequency shifts the downstream link signal from F<highlight><subscript>dn</subscript></highlight>(<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) to F<highlight><subscript>dn</subscript></highlight>(<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) to form an interior downstream coverage signal in the exemplary embodiment. Interior mobile stations <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> that are exposed to a suitable quality signal transmitted from the building interface station <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, directly receive interior downstream coverage signals at F<highlight><subscript>dn</subscript></highlight>(<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). An interior mobile station <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> may receive interior downstream coverage signals directly from the building interface station <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and from one or more distribution stations <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. The interior downstream coverage signals, therefore, are transmitted using simulcast techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> An upstream interior signal is transmitted from the mobile station <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> at a frequency F<highlight><subscript>up</subscript></highlight>(<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>).

The upstream distribution signal is transmitted, at F<highlight><subscript>up</subscript></highlight>(<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>), to the building interface station <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The building interface station <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> frequency shifts the upstream distribution signal from F<highlight><subscript>up</subscript></highlight>(<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) to F<highlight><subscript>up</subscript></highlight>(<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) to produce an upstream link signal.

The base interface station <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> frequency shifts the upstream signal to F<highlight><subscript>up</subscript></highlight>(<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) which can be the same frequency as a frequency used by the exterior mobile stations <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> for transmitting signals to the base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. In the exemplary embodiment, the F<highlight><subscript>up</subscript></highlight>(<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) is the same as the frequency (or frequencies) used by the exterior mobile stations <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> for transmitting signals to the base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The building interface station <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> includes at least a link communication interface <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> for communicating through the wireless link channel <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and an in-building communication interface <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> for communicating through the wireless distribution channel <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> and the interior wireless coverage channel <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. The block diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates a building interface station <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> where the in-building communication interface <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> includes a distribution communication interface <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> for communicating through the wireless distribution channel <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> and a coverage communication interface <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight> for communicating through the wireless coverage channel <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. The functions of the communication interfaces <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> can be implemented using any combination of software, hardware and firmware. Exemplary implementations are discussed below. The blocks representing the communication interfaces <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> are shown using dashed lines to indicate that each of the communication interfaces (<highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>) may include other functional blocks or portions of function blocks shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. For example, some or all of the communication interfaces <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> may include portions of the frequency shifters <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> or the controller <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The building interface station <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> includes a downstream frequency shifter <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> for each channel to frequency shift incoming downstream link signals to the interior coverage frequency and to the interior distribution frequency. An upstream frequency shifter <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> for each link channel <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> frequency shifts the interior upstream coverage signal and the upstream distribution signal to the upstream link frequency. Accordingly, each downstream link signal is frequency shifted to produce two signals at different frequencies and upstream signals received from both interior mobile stations <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and distribution stations <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> are frequency shifted to the same corresponding upstream link frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> A controller <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> provides control signals to the frequency shifters <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> as described below in reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. In the exemplary embodiment, the controller <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is a PC104 a microprocessor model number available from the JUMPtec&reg; Industrielle Computertechnik AG company. The controller <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, however, may be any type of micro-processor, computer, processor, processor arrangement or processor combination suitable for implementing the functionality discussed herein. Software running on the controller <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> provides the various control functions and facilitates the overall functionality of the building interface station <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> A downstream link signal transmitted from the base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> at the downstream link frequency is received through the link antenna <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. In the exemplary embodiment, the link antenna <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is a directional antenna aligned to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio of signals transmitted between the base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the building interface station <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Other types of antennas may be used and, in certain instances recognized by those skilled in the art, other types of antennas may be preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In accordance with known techniques, a link duplexer <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> allows for the use of one link antenna <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> for receiving downstream link signals and transmitting upstream link signals. A Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> amplifies the downstream link signal received through the link antenna <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and the duplexer <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. Although several types of LNAs can be used to provide the appropriate gain and noise characteristics, an example of a suitable LNA <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is the LP1500-SOT89, a PHEMT (Pseudomorphic High Electron Mobility Transistor) from Filtronic Solid-State, a division of Filtronic plc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The amplified downstream link signal is received at the input of a signal splitter <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. In the exemplary embodiment, the signal splitter <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> has two outputs where the signals produced at each output have a power level that is approximately 3 dB lower than the power of the signal at the input. Although the signal splitter <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> may have any number of outputs, a suitable implementation includes a number of outputs in accordance with the number of downstream link signals that the building interface station <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> can receive. The signal produced at each output of the signal splitter <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> is received at a downstream frequency shifter <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> As discussed in further detail below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the downstream frequency shifter <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> shifts the signal received at its input to both a downstream coverage frequency and a downstream distribution frequency. Each downstream frequency shifter <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> in the building interface station <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> shifts signals at a particular frequency of the downstream link channel <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> to a downstream coverage frequency and a downstream distribution frequency associated with a particular downstream link frequency. In the exemplary embodiment, therefore, the two downstream frequency shifters <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> shift each of the two downstream link signals to two downstream coverage frequencies and to two downstream distribution frequencies. The various frequencies of the channels can be changed by the controller <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. In the exemplary embodiment, the frequencies are configured at the time of system installation in accordance with the system frequency allocation scheme. The building interface station <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> can be configured, depending on the particular communication system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, to dynamically adjust frequencies during operation of the building interface station <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> within the system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The downstream distribution signals at the output of each downstream frequency shifter <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> are combined in a signal combiner <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> and amplified by an amplifier <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>. A distribution duplexer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> allows for downstream distribution signals and upstream distribution signals to be transmitted and received through the same distribution antenna <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. The distribution antenna <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> is a directional antenna, typically consisting of one or more patch antennas arranged in an array and is horizontally polarized in order to in increase isolation between the distribution signals and other signals present in the building structure <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The distribution antenna <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, however, may have any one of several configurations or polarization. As discussed below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the functions of the distribution antenna <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> and the coverage antenna <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> can be combined in a single vertically polarized antenna. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The downstream coverage signal produced at the output of the downstream frequency shifter <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is combined with the other downstream coverage signal from the other downstream frequency shifter <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> in a signal combiner <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>. The combiner <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> includes at least one input for each downstream frequency shifter <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. The combined downstream signal is amplified in an amplifier <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> and transmitted through the coverage antenna <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>. A coverage duplexer <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> allows the transmission and reception of downstream and upstream coverage signals through a single coverage antenna <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

The amplified upstream coverage signal is received at an input of a signal splitter <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>. In the exemplary embodiment, the signal splitter <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> has one output for each of the coverage channels and, therefore, has two outputs. The signal produced at each output of the signal splitter <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> is received at the input of each upstream frequency shifter <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> An LNA <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> amplifies the upstream distribution signals that are received through the distribution antenna <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> and the distribution duplexer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. The amplified upstream distribution signal is received at an input of a signal splitter <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight>. In the exemplary embodiment, the signal splitter <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> has one output for each of the coverage channels and, therefore, has two outputs. The signal produced at each output of the signal splitter <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> is received at the input of each upstream frequency shifter <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Each upstream frequency shifter <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> shifts the upstream coverage signal from the upstream coverage frequency to the upstream link frequency. The upstream distribution signal is shifted from the upstream distribution frequency to the upstream link frequency. The resulting upstream link signal, therefore, includes information transmitted directly from the interior mobile station <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> through the coverage channel and information transmitted from the interior mobile station <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> through the distribution station <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. When upstream signals are received through both the distribution channel and the coverage channel from a single interior mobile station <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, both signals are frequency shifted to the same upstream link frequency to form a combined upstream signal. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the characteristics of the combined signal waveform are similar to the characteristics of a signal received through a wireless channel having reflection and refraction due to obstacles. Accordingly, the upstream link signal can be received by the base interface station <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> in accordance with known techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Each resulting upstream link signal is amplified in an amplifier <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> and combined with the other resulting upstream signals from the other upstream frequency shifter <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> in the signal combiner <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight>. The combined signal, which includes upstream link signals at two different upstream link frequencies is transmitted through the link duplexer <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and the link antenna <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

Although the building interface station <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> may be preferred for signal isolation characteristics, the building interface station <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> may have cost advantages. The use of the particular building interface station <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> or modification of the building interface stations <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> described herein depend on the particular communication system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> factors readily recognized by those skilled in the art. </paragraph>

The downstream distribution signals produced at the outputs of each downstream frequency shifter <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> are combined in the signal combiner. The combined downstream coverage signals and the combined downstream distribution signals are combined in a signal combiner <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> and amplified by an amplifier <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. Other combination and amplification techniques in accordance with known methods can be used to perform the desired result. For example, the signal combiners <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> may be replaced by a single signal combiner. A duplexer <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> allows the transmission of the distribution and coverage downstream signals as well at the reception of distribution and coverage upstream signals through the antenna <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The upstream distribution and coverage signals are amplified by an LNA <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, split into two signal sets by a signal splitter <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> and directed to splitters <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight>. The splitters <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> further split the signals to allow a sufficient signal power level at the input of each upstream frequency shifter <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. Other methods of splitting and amplifying the signals can be used to provide adequate signals to the upstream frequency shifters <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. For example, the signal splitters <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, can be replaced with a single signal splitter. </paragraph>

A variable attenuator <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> is adjusted to provide the appropriate power level of the downstream signal to a signal mixer <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>. In the exemplary embodiment, analog power control signals generated by the controller <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> are received at a control inputs of the variable attenuators <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight> in the downstream frequency shifter <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The signal mixer <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> mixes the downstream signal with a mixing signal generated by an oscillator <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> to shift the downstream signal to an intermediate frequency (IF). The signal mixer <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> is a down-mixer and the IF is approximately 199 MHz in the exemplary embodiment. The IF, however, can be any suitable frequency chosen in accordance with known techniques and will depend on the particular communication system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> requirements. In digital or software radio implementations the IF maybe zero or near zero. </paragraph>

The band-pass filter <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> is a Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) filter having a bandwidth of approximately 0.2 MHz. Any one of several filters can be used and the filter selection depends on the type of system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, bandwidth of the transmitted signal, the required Signal-to-Noise (SNR) ratio of the signals, the isolation required between link, coverage, and distribution frequencies, and several other factors recognized by those skilled in the art. The band-pass filter <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> attenuates signals outside the desired frequency bandwidth and allows the desired signals to pass to the distribution mixer <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> and coverage mixer <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

In the exemplary embodiment, the controller <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> is a PC104 microprocessor available from JUMPtec&reg; Industrielle Computertechnik AG. The controller <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight>, however, may be any type of micro-processor, computer, processor, processor arrangement or processor combination suitable for implementing the functionality discussed herein. Software running on the controller <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> provides the various control functions and facilitates the overall functionality of the distribution station <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> A downstream distribution signal transmitted from the building interface station <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> at the downstream distribution frequency is received through the distribution antenna <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight>. In the exemplary embodiment, the distribution antenna <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> is a directional antenna aligned to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio of signals transmitted between the building interface station <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and the distribution station <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. Other types of antennas may be used and, in certain instances recognized by those skilled in the art, other types of antennas may be preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> In accordance with known techniques, a duplexer <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> allows for the use of a single distribution antenna <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> for receiving downstream distribution signals and transmitting upstream distribution signals. A Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> amplifies the downstream distribution signal received through the distribution antenna <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> and the duplexer <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>. Although several types of LNAs <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> can be used to provide the appropriate gain and noise characteristics, an example of a suitable LNA <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> is the LP1500-SOT89 PHEMT (Pseudomorphic High Electron Mobility Transistor) from Filtronic Solid-State, a division of Filtronic plc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The amplified downstream distribution signal is received at the input of a signal splitter <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight>. In the exemplary embodiment, the signal splitter <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight> has two outputs where the signals produced at each output have a power level that is approximately 3 dB lower than the power of the signal at the input. Although the signal splitter <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight> may have any number of outputs, a suitable implementation includes a number of outputs in accordance with the number of channels that the distribution station <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> can receive. The signal at each output is received at a downstream frequency shifter <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

In the exemplary embodiment, therefore, the two downstream frequency shifters <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> shift signals at two downstream distribution frequencies with the wireless distribution channel <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> to two downstream coverage frequencies within the wireless coverage channel <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. Although the various frequencies of the channels can be changed by the controller <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight>, the frequencies are configured at the time of system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> installation in accordance with the system frequency allocation scheme in the exemplary embodiment. A suitable control technique includes the use of a wireless modem system connected to the controller <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> for channel and frequency management. The distribution station <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> can be configured depending on the particular communication system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, to dynamically adjust frequencies during operation of the distribution station <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> with the system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

A coverage duplexer <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> allows for downstream coverage signals and upstream coverage signals to be transmitted and received through the same coverage antenna <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight>. The coverage antenna <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight> is a vertically polarized directional antenna, such as the S1857AMP10SMF antenna from Cushcraft Communications.

The amplified upstream coverage signal is received at an input of a signal splitter <highlight><bold>626</bold></highlight>. In the exemplary embodiment, the signal splitter <highlight><bold>626</bold></highlight> has one output for each of the coverage channels and, therefore, has two outputs. The signals produced at each output of the signal splitter <highlight><bold>626</bold></highlight> are received at the input of each upstream frequency shifter <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>. The upstream frequency shifter <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> shifts the upstream coverage signal from the upstream coverage frequency to the upstream distribution frequency. </paragraph>

In the exemplary embodiment, therefore, the two upstream frequency shifters <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> shift two signals at two upstream coverage frequencies to two upstream distribution frequencies. The upstream coverage signals at the output of each upstream frequency shifter <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> are amplified by amplifiers <highlight><bold>628</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight> and combined in a signal combiner <highlight><bold>632</bold></highlight> before transmission to the building interface station <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> through the duplexer <highlight><bold>632</bold></highlight> and the distribution antenna <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>. In the exemplary embodiment, the distribution stations <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> are distributed along the floor of the building <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and positioned to maximize the quality of the communication link between the distribution stations <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and the building interface station <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, while establishing uniform wireless service to the mobile stations <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> on the floor. </paragraph>
