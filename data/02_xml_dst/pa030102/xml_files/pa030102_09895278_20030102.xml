<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The length of interconnects between and within microprocessor data paths in functional unit blocks has increased as integration density has increased in integrated circuits (ICs). Because interconnect capacitance per unit length increases rapidly with lateral dimension scaling, long point-to-point interconnects may cause performance and power bottlenecks in ICs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The substitution of dynamic CMOS interconnect drivers for static CMOS drivers in high performance on-chip busses has been explored. In busses with static drivers, when neighboring wires switch in the opposite directions, e.g., from Vss to Vcc on one wire and from Vcc to Vss on its neighbor, the voltage drop on the terminal of the parasitic capacitor between the two wires is not Vcc&minus;Vss, but is doubled to (Vcc&minus;Vss)*2. Due to the Miller effect, the effective capacitance seen by the wire is doubled, yielding a Miller Coupling Factor (MCF) of 2.0. In busses with dynamic drivers, all wires are reset to a pre-charge state (for example, Vss) in a pre-charge portion of the clock cycle, and then may either remain at that state or switch to an opposite state (Vcc in this example) in an evaluate portion of the cycle. Thus two neighboring wires cannot switch in opposite directions from the pre-charge state, and the maximum voltage drop on the terminals of the parasitic capacitors between the two wires will be (Vcc&minus;Vss). Thus, the MCF is reduced from 2.0 in static CMOS drivers to 1.0 in dynamic CMOS drivers, thereby reducing a large component of the wire&apos;s worst-case effective coupling capacitance. However, dynamic circuits tend to be more susceptible to noise than static circuits. This may not present a problem in circuits where the inputs are well shielded, but may present a problem in dynamic busses, where the distance from the driver and the large resistance of the interconnect isolate the end of a bus segment from its restoring impedance.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates a dynamic bus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> according to an embodiment. The bus includes multiple bus lines <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The bus lines may be arranged as domino data paths, each bus line including a dynamic driver <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> at the input <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, a series of inverting stages <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, each including a CMOS inverter <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and a wire resistance <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, and a clocked flip flop (FF) <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> at the output <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. A dynamic bus repeater <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> in the middle of the bus line divides the bus line into a front segment <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and a rear segment <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The driver <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and the FF <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> are clocked by a &PHgr;1 clock. The dynamic repeater is clocked by a &PHgr;2 clock. Each clock splits a clock cycle into a precharge phase and an evaluate phase. In the precharge phase, the output node of the circuits in the dynamic bus are &ldquo;pre-charged&rdquo; to Vcc or Vss (alternating between inverting stages). In the evaluate phase, the output node of each circuit is conditionally charged to Vcc (or discharged to Vss) based on its input. Thus, during the evaluate phase each circuit will either transition between Vcc and Vss or be quiescent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a circuit diagram of an exemplary dynamic driver <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The driver includes a domino gate <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and an inverter <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. In the pre-charge phase, the &PHgr;1 clock signal is LOW. PMOS transistor <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is turned on, proving a path from Vcc, and NMOS transistor <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is turned off, closing the path to Vss. This pulls intermediate node <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> HIGH, which is inverted to a LOW signal by the inverter <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. The LOW pre-charge signal propagates through the bus line, pre-charging the output nodes of the inverters <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, FF <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, and dynamic repeater <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In the evaluate phase, the &PHgr;1 clock signal transitions HIGH, turning off the PMOS transistor <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and turning on the NMOS transistor <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. If the data signal input to the driver is HIGH, an input NMOS transistor <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> turns on and opens a path to Vss through NMOS transistor <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, pulling the intermediate node <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> LOW, which is inverted to a HIGH signal at the output node <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. This HIGH data signal propagates through the bus line. If the input data signal is LOW, the input NMOS transistor is off, blocking the path to Vss. Consequently, the intermediate node <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> remains HIGH, and the output node remains LOW. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The dynamic repeater splits the bus line into front and rear segments. The &PHgr;2 clock is timed so that the rear segment of the bus is pre-charging while the front segment evaluates, and vice versa. In this manner, the pre-charge signal generated at the output node of the dynamic driver during pre-charge does not have to propagate through the entire bus line before the driver can evaluate a data signal at its input. The dynamic repeater has a latching function that hides the pre-charge state of the front segment from the rear segment while the rear segment is evaluating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The &PHgr;2 clock signal is approximately an inversion of the &PHgr;1 signal. However, there may be an overlap window to account for clock skew. Also, the &PHgr;2 clock may be timed so that &PHgr;2 goes HIGH and places the dynamic repeater in evaluate mode slightly before the data signal from the front segment reaches the input node of the repeater. During the period between entering the evaluate mode and possibly receiving the data signal, the repeater is most susceptible to noise in the bus. If the noise exceeds the repeater&apos;s noise margin, the input transistor could switch, causing a false data signal to propagate down the rear segment of the bus line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Dynamic bus repeaters may increase speed and decrease power consumption in the bus compared to static bus repeaters, but may be more susceptible to noise. Static inverters in busses can have a noise margin of about Vcc/2, i.e., a direct current (DC) input voltage of Vcc/2 produces an equal DC output voltage of Vcc/2. In a standard domino dynamic repeater, the noise margin may be only slightly higher than the threshold voltage, V<highlight><subscript>T</subscript></highlight>, of the input transistor. While this may be acceptable for circuits where the inputs are well shielded, dynamic busses may be particularly susceptible to capacitive coupling and other sources of noise because the distance from of the repeater from the driver and the large resistance of the long interconnect isolate the repeater from its restoring impedance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a circuit diagram of a dynamic bus repeater <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> with an improved noise margin of about Vcc/2. The dynamic repeater includes a domino gate <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, an intermediate node <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, two pull-up PMOS transistors <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, a feedback inverter <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and an output inverter <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the pre-charge state of the input node of the dynamic repeater is LOW (Vss). In an alternate embodiment, described in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the front segment includes an additional inverter stage, and the pre-charge state of the input node of the dynamic repeater is HIGH (Vcc). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment, the intermediate node <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is HIGH in the pre-charge state and the output node <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> is LOW. The repeater enters the evaluate mode when &PHgr;2 goes HIGH, turning the top PMOS transistor <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> in the domino gate <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> OFF and turning the bottom NMOS transistor <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> ON. While the input node remains at the LOW pre-charge state, an input NMOS transistor <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> remains OFF, thereby maintaining the HIGH state of the intermediate node <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> and LOW state of the output node <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. Any noise signals at the input node of the dynamic repeater must exceed the noise margin of Vcc/2 for a sufficient amount of time to cause the input NMOS to turn ON, thereby providing a path to Vss and pulling the intermediate node LOW, consequently causing the output node to transition to a HIGH state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The feedback inverter <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> provides an additional delay to switching in response to a noise signal. When a noise signal exceeds Vcc/2, the input NMOS transistor <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> starts to turn on, opening a path to Vss, and starts to turn off the lower pull-up PMOS transistor <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, closing the path to Vcc. As the path to Vcc begins to close and the path to Vss to open, the voltage on the intermediate node <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> begins to drop from HIGH to LOW. This signal starts to activate the feedback inverter <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. After a sufficient amount of time, the signal at the node <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> at the input of the top pull-up PMOS transistor <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> would transition fully from LOW to HIGH, turning off the upper pull-up PMOS transistor and completely closing the path to Vcc. However, this feedback path produces a delay in closing the path to Vcc. Thus, the noise signal must exceed Vcc/2 for a sufficient amount of time to cause the output node to switch to a HIGH state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> While the rear segment of the bus is evaluating, the dynamic repeater hides the pre-charge signal propagating through the front segment from the rear segment. If the data signal was HIGH in the previous cycle, then the input NMOS transistor is ON, the intermediate node <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is LOW, and the output node <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> is HIGH in the evaluate phase of that cycle. When the pre-charge signal for the present cycle reaches the input node <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, the LOW signal turns off the input NMOS transistor <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>, and turns on the lower pull-up PMOS transistor <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. However, the LOW signal on the intermediate node <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> and inverted to a HIGH signal by the feedback inverter <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> maintains the upper pull-up PMOS in the OFF state, providing no path to Vcc. Thus, the intermediate node <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> remains LOW and the output node remains HIGH, thereby hiding the pre-charge signal from the rear segment of the bus. If the data signal was LOW in the previous cycle, the LOW pre-charge signal will not change the state of bus, including the rear segment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The transistors in the repeater must be sized to provide the circuit with a noise margin of Vcc/2. The pull-up PMOS transistors, the input transistor <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>, and the bottom NMOS transistor <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> are sized in a ratio such that an equivalent circuit including these transistors, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, has a noise margin of Vcc/2. With &PHgr;2 HIGH, the top PMOS transistor is OFF and may be removed from the equivalent circuit. The feedback inverter <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and output inverter <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> are static CMOS inverters, each with a noise margin of Vcc/2. Thus, with the output node of the repeater at Vcc/2 (the noise margin state), the input nodes of the output inverter and feedback inverter at intermediate node <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> and node <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>, respectively, are also at Vcc/2. Since the inputs and outputs of the inverters are equal, they may be removed from the equivalent circuit. The remaining transistors in the equivalent circuit may be sized to achieve the noise margin state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a circuit diagram of an alternate embodiment of the dynamic repeater <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> in which the pre-charge state of the input node is HIGH. As described above, the front segment may have one more (or less) inverting stage than the bus shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, thereby inverting the LOW pre-charge signal issued by the dynamic driver. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The dynamic repeater <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> includes a domino gate <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, an intermediate node <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>, two pull-down NMOS transistors <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>, a feedback inverter <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> and an output inverter <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>. The upper PMOS transistor <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> and lower NMOS transistor <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> of the domino gate are clocked by the &PHgr;1 clock. The timing scheme of the &PHgr;1 clock is such that the repeater enters the evaluate mode slightly before the data signal from the first segment reaches the repeater. For example, the &PHgr;1 clock signal to the dynamic driver may be delayed to achieve this timing condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment, the intermediate node <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> is LOW in the pre-charge state and the output node <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> is HIGH. The repeater <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> enters the evaluate mode when &PHgr;1 goes LOW, turning top PMOS transistor <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> ON and turning the bottom NMOS transistor <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> OFF. While the input node remains at the HIGH pre-charge state, the input PMOS transistor <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight> remains OFF, thereby keeping the path to Vcc closed and maintaining the LOW state of the intermediate node <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> and HIGH state of the output node <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>. Any noise signals at the input node of the dynamic repeater must exceed the noise margin of Vcc/2 for a sufficient amount of time to cause the input PMOS transistor <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight> to turn ON, thereby providing a path to Vcc and pulling the intermediate node HIGH, consequently causing the output node to transition to a LOW state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The circuit operates in a manner similar to the dynamic repeater shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, with NMOS pull-down transistors providing a path to Vss rather than Vcc. As described above, the feedback inverter provides an additional delay to the circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> While the rear segment of the bus is evaluating, the dynamic repeater hides the pre-charge signal propagating through the front segment from the rear segment. If the inverted data signal was LOW in the previous cycle, then the input PMOS transistor is ON, the intermediate node is HIGH, and the output node is LOW in the evaluate phase of that cycle. When the inverted (HIGH) pre-charge signal for the present cycle reaches the input node, the HIGH signal turns off the input PMOS transistor, and turns on the upper pull-down NMOS transistor. However, the HIGH signal on the intermediate node and inverted to a LOW signal by the feedback inverter maintains the lower pull-down NMOS in the OFF state, providing no path to Vss. Thus, the intermediate node remains HIGH and the output node LOW, thereby hiding the pre-charge signal from the rear segment of the bus. If the inverted data signal was HIGH in the previous cycle, the inverted (HIGH) pre-charge signal will not change the state of bus, including the rear segment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is an equivalent circuit of that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> at the noise margin state and illustrates the transistors to size to achieve a noise margin of Vcc/2. In the present embodiment, the lower NMOS transistor <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> and inverters <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> drop out, and the upper PMOS transistor <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> and the input PMOS transistor <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight> of the domino gate <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> and pull-down NMOS transistors <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> must be sized to achieve a noise margin of Vcc/2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> A number of embodiments have been described. Nevertheless, it will be understood that various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, steps of the various operations may be performed in a different order and still achieve desirable results.
