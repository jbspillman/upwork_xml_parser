<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">An interactive mirror for a motel or hotel automatically communicates with an individual staying in a room when the light in the room in which the mirror is mounted is turned on. The interactive mirror places the individual with room service, can be deactivated by the individual, permits light from a source positioned behind the mirror to be visible to the individual when the individual stands in front of the mirror, and permits audio and visual communication with the individual. </paragraph>
</subdoc-abstract>
<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to mirrors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> More particularly, the invention relates to an interactive mirror system for an overnight lodging establishment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In a further respect, the invention relates to an interactive mirror system for a motel or hotel which automatically communicates with an individual staying in a room when the light in the room in which the mirror is mounted is turned on, which places the individual in contact with room service or other services, which can be deactivated by the individual, which permits light from a source positioned behind the mirror to be visible to the individual when the individual stands in front of the mirror, and which permits audio and visual communication with the individual. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A variety of systems are known for communicating with an individual staying overnight in the Holiday Inn (SM), Hilton (SM), Sheraton (SM) or other overnight lodging establishment. The front desk of the hotel/motel can leave a message accessible via the telephone in the room. Messages can be imprinted on paper slips or forms which are slid under the door to the room. Placards can be left in the room. One important objective of such methods of communication is to insure that the individual(s) staying in the room actually reads or listens to the communication. Another objective is to require only a minimal effort on the part of the individual to read or listen to the communication. It usually is more likely that an individual will look at a communication if only a minimal amount of time and effort is required. Another objective of such communications is to make them look interesting or inviting so the individual will want to read or listen to the communication. While conventional means of communicating with an individual in a hotel room have had success, it would be highly desirable to provide an improved method of communicating which would better insure that an individual staying in the room actually read or listened to the communication, which would require minimal effort on the part of the individual, and which would look or sound interesting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Therefore, it is a principal object of the instant invention to provide an improved method and apparatus for communicating with an individual who is staying in a room in a hotel or motel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A further object of the invention is to provide an improved method and apparatus which automatically communicates with an individual when an individual enters the room. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Another object of the invention is to provide an improved communication method and apparatus which enables an individual to groom himself or herself while simultaneously communicating with the staff at an overnight lodging establishment.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Turning now to the drawings, which describe the presently preferred embodiments of the invention for the purpose of describing the operation and use thereof and not by way of limitation of the scope of the invention, and in which like reference characters refer to corresponding elements throughout the several views, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is an exploded view illustrating a laminate mirror construction including rectangular piece <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of clear glass. As used herein, the term &ldquo;glass&rdquo; includes borosilicates and other clear glasses and also includes polymer and other compositions which produce a clear transparent material. Piece <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a front rectangular surface <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and a rear rectangular surface <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Piece <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also includes an upper portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>B and a lower portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A. The back surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (below dashed line A) of lower portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A is coated with silver or another functionally comparable material which enables lower portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A to function as a mirror. The back surface <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> (above dashed line A) of upper portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>B is coated with a material which prevents an individual standing in front of piece <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to see LEDs and other apparatus mounted in U-shaped groove <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> behind piece <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, but which permits light from LEDs or other light sources to travel through the material coating surface <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, through back surface <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of upper portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>B, and through upper portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>B to be viewed by a person standing in front of piece <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The thickness of piece <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can vary as desired but is presently preferably about one-quarter of an inch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Rectangular piece <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can be fabricated from any desired material, but is presently fabricated from a polyvinyl material to reduce the likelihood that piece <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will break or shatter. Piece <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is secured to back <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> with adhesive or any other desired fastening means. U-shaped groove <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is cut in piece <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> such that LED&apos;s, a microprocessor, a speaker/receiver <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, television screen, light sensor <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and/or other desired electronics and equipment can be mounted in the space <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> behind upper portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>B and/or lower portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A. The thickness of piece <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can vary as desired, but piece <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is presently about five-sixteenths of an inch thick. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Although not necessary, an additional piece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of material can be fastened to piece <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and may also include a U-shaped opening <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to facilitate the positioning of LEDs, speakers, etc. behind upper portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>B and/or lower portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Openings <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> are formed through piece <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to facilitate the broadcast of sound by speaker/receiver <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and to facilitate the pickup by receiver <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the voice of an individual standing in front of the interactive mirror system of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> After piece <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is adhered to piece <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, piece <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is adhered or fastened to a vertical wall <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in a room in an overnight lodging establishment. As used herein, overnight lodging establishments refer to hotels and motels and resorts and other establishments where individuals normally stay for one night or for relatively short periods of time of up to several weeks while traveling, vacationing, or on business. Overnight lodging establishments normally do not comprise the permanent residence of an individual. Best Western (SM), Hotel 6 (SM), Hilton (SM), Holiday Inn (SM), and Travel Lodge (SM) are well known examples of such establishments. The mirror system of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is typically, although not necessarily, mounted on a wall <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> such that when an individual of average height is standing in front of the mirror system, the individual&apos;s eye level is about at the center <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the mirror system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Each room in an overnight lodging establishment ordinarily includes at least one light <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and a wall switch or other control <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> for turning the light on and off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In operation, the mirror system of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is installed in a room in the MIRAGE, an overnight lodging establishment. For purposes of this example, it is assumed that the mirror system is installed on a vertical wall in the bathroom of the room. When the individual checks into his room, it is 2:00 p.m. The individual walks into the bathroom and uses the wall switch <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> in the bathroom to turn on light <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and illuminate the bathroom with light <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Sensor <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> detects light <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and generates a signal to a microprocessor <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> mounted in area <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The microprocessor <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> causes the following audible message to be broadcast from receiver/speaker <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> through apertures <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> to the individual: &ldquo;Good afternoon. Thank you for choosing the MIRAGE.&rdquo; The microprocessor <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> also activates LEDs mounted in area <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> so that &ldquo;WELCOME&rdquo; appears in the manner illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The microprocessor <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> then causes the LEDs to display the message: &ldquo;Would you like room service&quest; Please answer yes or no.&rdquo; If desired, the microprocessor <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can also broadcast this question over receiver/speaker <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. If the individual answers &ldquo;No.&rdquo;, this is picked up by receiver/speaker <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and processed by voice recognition software in the microprocessor <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The microprocessor <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> causes &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; to be broadcast over receiver/speaker <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. If the individual answers &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;, this answer is pickup up by receiver/speaker <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and is processed by voice recognition software in the microprocessor <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The microprocessor <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> causes room service to be called. An individual in room service answers and his or her voice response &ldquo;This is room service. May we have your room number please&quest;&rdquo; is broadcast over receiver/speaker <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. In the alternative, room service can call the individual on the telephone in the individual&apos;s room. The individual then orders by conversing with room service via receiver/speaker <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The microprocessor <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can be connected to room service, to the front desk of the hotel, to the valet service, etc. by hard wire, by fiber optic line, by a transmitter, or by any other desired communication apparatus. In one embodiment of the invention, a receiver/transmitter <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is placed on each floor of a hotel to receive by wire signal, by fiber optic signal, by wireless signal, etc. the signals that are generated by the microprocessor <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The microprocessor <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> includes receiver/transmitter apparatus for communicating with the receiver/transmitter <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. After the receiver/transmitter <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> receives a signal from the microprocessor <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the signal is transmitted by the receiver/transmitter <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> to the front desk, to room service, etc. The receiver/transmitter <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> also receives signals from the front desk, room service, etc. and transmits the signals to the microprocessor <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The individual staying in the room can use switch <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to disable or turn off the mirror system of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> so that the mirror system will not communicate audibly or visually with the individual. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> A sticker <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> on piece <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> states: &ldquo;This mirror system does NOT include a camera. Your activities in your room are PRIVATE and are NOT monitored by the hotel. Monitoring of your activities is FORBIDDEN by FEDERAL and STATE statutes.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> A television screen can be placed in area <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to display conventional television programs, to run advertisements, or to display any other desired information. Light from the television screen passes through section <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>B and can be viewed by an individual standing in front of the mirror system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the &ldquo;WELCOME&rdquo; can be displayed as a rolling script which moves from left to right. Other messages or advertisements can also be displayed in rolling script or displayed one word at a time without rolling or moving from side-to-side across an LED matrix or other light display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Having described my invention in such terms as to be understood by those of skill in the art, and having described the presently preferred embodiments thereof, I claim: </paragraph>
