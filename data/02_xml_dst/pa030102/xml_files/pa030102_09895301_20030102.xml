<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a semiconductor device and a method for manufacturing the same which are capable of reducing a short channel effect which causes a decrease in a threshold voltage in the semiconductor such as an FET (Field Effect Transistor). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> When a semiconductor device such as a MOS (Metal Oxide Semiconductor) transistor is scaled down, a so-called scaling law is used as an index. However, it is impossible to lower a supply voltage to meet the scaling law due to a need for considerations to be given to the supply of power to other semiconductor devices, which, as a result, causes impact ionization in which an electron and a hole are generated because of collision of a hot carrier having high energy caused by a high voltage within a channel region between a source and a drain with a lattice of the semiconductor device within a channel region. That is, this causes a so-called &ldquo;hot carrier effect&rdquo; in which a threshold voltage (Vth) is changed due to a fixed charge accumulated in a gate insulator of the MOS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> To solve this problem, a device having an LDD (Lightly Doped Drain) structure to reduce the generation of hot carriers is proposed. In such the device having the LDD structure, a region providing a low impurity concentration is formed which is placed in contact with each of a pair of impurity regions for a source and a drain and has the impurity concentration being lower than that in each of the pair of impurity regions and extends in a channel extending direction from each of the corresponding impurity regions. The region having the low impurity concentration limits an electric field existing in the vicinity of the drain and the generation of the hot carriers is reduced by the electric field limiting effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A method for forming a semiconductor device having such the LDD structure is disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. Hei 5-315355 in which the pair of the impurity regions to be used for the source and drain is formed by using a thermal diffusion method and each of the impurity regions having the low impurity concentration and extending from each of the impurity regions for the source and drain is formed by using ion implantation method. Moreover, a method is disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. Hei 5-153612 for forming both the pair of the impurity regions to be used for the source and drain and the low concentration impurity regions extending from each of the impurity regions to be used for the source and the drain, by using the ion concentration method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In the conventional method, the extended impurity regions each extending from each of the pair of the impurity regions to be used for the source and the drain toward the channel direction are formed by using the ion implantaton method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Therefore, in the conventional technology, since the impurity region is formed by the ion implantation method, its impurity distribution shows that the impurity concentration is not lowered gradually from a surface of the device, but it becomes increased at a predetermined depth from the surface and exhibits its maximum level at the predetermined depth and then becomes decreased as the depth from the surface becomes larger. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The impurity distribution in the impurity region formed by the ion implantation in which the maximum impurity concentration is exhibited at the predetermined depth from the surface shows that the short channel effect produced at a position being lower than the surface is reduced as a result. As described above, the short channel effect causes the decrease in the threshold voltage and also causes a so-called punch-through phenomenon in which a voltage between the source and drain cannot be controlled by the gate voltage. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">First Embodiment </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), (<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) and (<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) and FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), (<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) and (<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) are diagrams showing processes of manufacturing a semiconductor device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to a first embodiment of the present invention. In FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), (<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) and (<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) and FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), (<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) and (<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) is shown a process of manufacturing an n-channel MOS FET using, for example, a p-type substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), on a silicon semiconductor substrate exhibiting a p-type characteristic, as is well known, is formed a device separating region <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to partition an active region for a semiconductor device. The device separating region <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed by an STI (Shallow Trench Isolation) method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> On the active region partitioned by the device separating region <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed a gate electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> used for the MOS FET. The gate electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> includes a gate electrode member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>formed on the active region with a gate insulator <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> interposed therebetween. To form the gate electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, as is well known, on the active region are sequentially stacked an insulating film (not shown) for the gate insulator <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and a conductive polycrystalline silicon layer (not shown) for the gate electrode member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Patterning is performed by photolithographic etching technology using an etching mask composed of, for example, a silicon nitride film formed on the conductive polycrystalline silicon layer. This causes the gate electrode material <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to be formed and the etching mask <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to reside on the gate electrode member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> After the gate electrode member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>has been formed, a silicon dioxide layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to be used as side walls (described later) is formed, for example, by a CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition) method in a manner so as to cover the etching mask <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> on the gate electrode member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and side portions of the gate electrode member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Then, in order to introduce the impurity into the silicon dioxide layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, n-type impurity is implanted by the ion implantation. It is preferable that the ion implantation is performed from a slanting direction so that the impurity is efficiently implanted in portions positioned on both sides of the gate electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the silicon dioxide layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, that is, in the side walls <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), to remove unwanted portions except those positioned on both sides of the gate electrode member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the silicon dioxide layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> containing the n-type impurity, for example, anisotropic etching processing is performed on the silicon dioxide layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. After the side walls <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> between which the gate electrode member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is interposed have been formed by using the anisotropic etching processing, the etching mask <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> formed using the silicon nitride film is removed by a selective etching method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Then, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>), an upper electrode member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is formed on the gate electrode member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a pair of the source/drain electrode members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> used for the source/drain is formed on the outsides of both the side walls <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> on the active region. To allow the upper electrode member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the pair of the source/drain electrode members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to be formed, a silicon layer (not shown) with a thickness of 50 nm is stacked and then etching processing is selectively performed on the silicon layer to remove unwanted portions, thus causing each of portions of the upper electrode member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the pair of the source/drain electrode members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to be formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Then, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), a cobalt layer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is formed in a manner that it covers the device separating region <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the side walls <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, the upper electrode member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the pair of the source/drain electrode members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The cobalt layer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is stacked so as to have a thickness of 50 nm, for example, by using a sputtering method, as is well known. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> After the cobalt layer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> has been formed, heating processing is performed on the upper electrode member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the pair of electrode members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> so that they become a silicide containing the cobalt. To cause them to become the silicide containing the cobalt, the cobalt layer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is heated up to, for example, about 550&deg; C., by a RTA methed, as pre-treatment. By this pretreatment, the cobalt is diffused from the cobalt layer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> to each of portions constituting the upper electrode member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the pair of the source/drain electrode members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> contacting the cobalt layer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and silicon contained in the upper electrode member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the pair of the source/drain electrode members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> changes to be cobalt monosilicide (CoSi). After the heating processing as the pre-treatment has been performed, an-reacted portion contained in the cobalt layer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is removed by chemicals and then heating processing at a temperature of about 800&deg; C. is performed by a RTA (Rapid Thermal Annealing) method. By the RTA method, each of the silicon components constituting the upper electrode member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the pair of the source/drain electrode members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is further changed to be cobalt disilicide (CoSi<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>).

The upper electrode member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>whose silicon component have been changed to be the silicide and the gate electrode member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>placed below the upper electrode member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>provide a conventionally well-known multi-layered gate electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The pair of the source/drain electrode members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> whose silicon component has been changed to be the silicide is enabled to be in a good ohmic contact with a conductive line drawn from the source/drain electrode members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Into regions below the pair of the source/drain electrode members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is implanted an n-type impurity such as phosphorous to form impurity regions to be used for the source and the drain. On the other hand, as described by referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), into the side walls between which the gate electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> made up of the gate electrode member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the upper electrode member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is disposed is implanted the n-type impurity while the side walls are being formed. The impurity concentration set at the time of the ion implantation into the pair of the source/drain electrode members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is higher than that set at the time of the ion implantation into the side walls <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> By performing heating processing, at a temperature of about 850&deg; C. for ten seconds, on the entire silicon semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, for example, by the RTA method, after the ion implantation of the n-type impurity into the pair of the source/drain electrode members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the impurity is diffused from the pair of the source/drain electrode members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to the silicon semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the impurity is diffused from both the side walls <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to the silicon semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> By the diffusion from the pair of the source/drain electrode members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, a pair of first impurity regions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is formed in the silicon semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> below the pair of the source/drain electrode members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> used for the source and the drain. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Moreover, by the diffusion from both the side walls <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, a pair of second impurity regions <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> each extending from an edge portion being in contact with each of the pair of the first impurity regions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> toward regions below the gate electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is formed in the silicon semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> below both the side walls <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. A depth of each of the second impurity regions <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, since the impurity concentration set at the time of the ion implantation into the side walls <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is lower that that set at the time of the ion implantation into the pair of the source/drain electrode members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, as described above, is smaller than that of each of the first impurity regions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Moreover, an impurity concentration in the second impurity regions <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is comparatively smaller than that in the first impurity regions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The semiconductor device having such the configurations as described above is called a device having the LDD structure in which the generation of the hot carriers can be effectively prevented by an field limiting effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the first embodiment of the present invention, each of the second impurity regions <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> being an extending impurity region which extends in a direction in which both the second impurity regions <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are brought near to each other from each of the pair of the first impurity regions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is formed by thermal diffusion of the impurity from the side walls <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The impurity concentration in the impurity region formed by such the thermal diffusion as described above is highest in the vicinity of the surface of the silicon semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and becomes lower as the depth from the surface becomes larger. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In such the impurity concentration distribution, in the case of the conventional extending impurity region formed by the ion implantation, as described above, since the maximum impurity concentration is exhibited at the predetermined depth from the surface of the substrate, the short channel effect is accelerated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Unlike in the case of the conventional semiconductor device, since the distribution of the impurity concentration in the extending impurity region <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the present invention shows that the impurity concentration becomes lower as the depth from the surface of the silicon semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> becomes larger, the short channel effect can be more efficiently reduced compared with the case of the conventional impurity regions, thus preventing the decrease in the threshold voltage caused by the short channel effect and avoiding the occurrence of the punch-through phenomenon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In the above description, the example in which the impurity concentration of the extending impurity region <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is lower than that in the source/drain regions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is explained, however, the impurity concentration in the extending impurity region <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is made equal almost to that in the source/drain regions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>.

<heading lvl="1">Second Embodiment </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In the process of manufacturing a semiconductor device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of a second embodiment of the present invention, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>), after a pair of the source/drain electrode members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> has been formed, a gate electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), on a silicon semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> exhibiting a p-type characteristic is formed a device separating region <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having the same structure as in the first embodiment. A silicon layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> with a thickness of 50 nm to be used as electrodes to be used for a source and a drain is formed on the active region partitioned by the device separating region <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Then, a cobalt layer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is formed in a manner that it covers the device separating region <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the silicon layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The cobalt layer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is formed by the well-known sputtering method so as to have the thickness of 50 nm. Moreover, to introduce an impurity into the cobalt layer, the n-type impurity such as phosphorous is implanted by the ion implantation method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Then, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), to form electrode members to be used for the source and drain, etching processing is performed on the silicon layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the cobalt layer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> existing on the silicon layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to remove their unwanted portions. Heating processing is performed so as to react the silicon residing by the etching processing with cobalt residing on the silicon and to form a source/drain electrode members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The heating processing is performed by combining the same pre-treatment heating as described above with heating treatment by the RTA method and before the RTA heating process is carried out, unwanted cobalt existing on the silicon portions is removed. The heating processing causes the silicon layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to react with the remaining portion of the cobalt layer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, thereby changing the remaining portion of the silicon layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to be a silicide which acts as the source/drain electrode members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Moreover, the RTA heating processing causes a part of the impurity incorporated into the source/drain electrode members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> out of the impurity implanted into the cobalt layer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> to be thermally diffused to the silicon semiconductor substrate and the thermal diffusion causes a pair of first impurity region <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to be used for the source and drain to be formed below the source and drain electrode members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> A silicon dioxide layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to be used as side walls to insulate the source/drain electrode members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the gate electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to be formed later is then formed by the CVD method in a manner that it covers the source/drain electrode members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> existing on the active region and the active region on which no source/drain electrode electrodes <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are formed. Moreover, in order to introduce the impurity into the silicon dioxide layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the n-type impurity such as phosphorous is implanted by the ion implantation. As in the case of the first embodiment, the impurity concentration at the time of the ion implantation into the silicon dioxide to be used as the side walls is set to be lower than that at the time of the ion implantation into the pair of the source/drain electrode members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. To efficiently implant the impurity into the portion to be used as the side walls, it is preferable to perform the ion implantation from a slanting direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Then, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>), side walls <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> having shapes being different from the side walls in the first embodiment are formed in a manner that each of the side walls extends toward a direction in which the source/drain electrode members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are brought near to each other from side portions of the source/drain electrode members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> facing each other and also in a manner that heights of the side walls gradually decrease. These side walls can be formed by performing the anisotropic etching on the silicon dioxide layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> containing the n-type impurity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>), the gate electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for the MOS FET is formed on the active region disposed between both the side walls <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Between the gate electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the active region is formed the gate insulator <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, as is well known. That is, when the gate electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is formed, as is well known, an insulating layer (not shown) to be used for the gate insulator <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and, for example, a conductive polycrystalline silicon layer (not shown) to be used for the gate electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are sequentially stacked. Then, patterning operation is performed on the stacked layer by the photolithographic etching technology using, for example, an etching mask (not shown) on the conductive polycrystalline silicon layer. Thus, the gate electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Then, by performing thermal treatment on the entire silicon semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> using, for example, the RTA method, at a temperature of about 850&deg; C. for 10 seconds, the impurity is diffused from both the side walls <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to the silicon semiconductor substrates <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and second impurity regions <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is formed which extend from edge portions of the first impurity regions coming near each other toward the gate electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Moreover, by the RTA heating treatment at the high temperature, the impurity is diffused from the pair of the source/drain electrode members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to the silicon semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, which causes the impurity concentration in the pair of the first impurity regions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to reach a proper concentration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> A depth of each of the second impurity regions <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, since the impurity concentration set at the time of the ion implantation into the side walls <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is lower that set at the time of the ion implantation into the pair of the source/drain electrode members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, as described above, is smaller than that of each of the first impurity regions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in the structure of the LDD having the second impurity region <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in which the impurity concentration is lower than that in the first impurity region <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the generation of the hot carriers can be efficiently prevented by the electric field limiting effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> In the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the second embodiment, as in the case of the first embodiment, the second impurity region <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> being the extending impurity region is formed by thermal diffusion of the impurity from the side walls <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Since the impurity concentration in the second impurity region <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is highest in the vicinity of the surface of the silicon semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and becomes lower as the depth from the surface becomes larger, the short channel effect occurring at a position being deeper than the surface of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can be efficiently reduced and the decrease in the threshold voltage caused by the short channel effect and the generation of the punch-through phenomenon can be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to the semiconductor device of the present invention, since the second impurity region extending from the first impurity region is formed by thermal diffusion from the side walls, the impurity concentration in the second impurity region gradually lowers as the depth from the surface of the semiconductor substrate becomes deeper, which can reduce the short channel effect causing the decrease in the threshold of the gate voltage controlling carriers between channels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Moreover, according to the semiconductor device of the present invention, by adjusting the impurity concentration in the second impurity region, that is, by setting so that the impurity concentration in the second impurity region is almost equal to that in the first impurity region, the short channel effect can be effectively reduced and, at the same time, sufficient drain currents can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, according to the method of manufacturing the semiconductor device of the present invention, such the semiconductor devices as described above can be manufactured comparatively easily. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> It is thus apparent that the present invention is not limited to the above embodiments but may be changed and modified without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. For example, in the above description, the present invention is applied to the n-type MOS transistor, however, the present invention can be applied to a p-type MOS transistor and a gate device of transistors other than the MOS transistor. </paragraph>
