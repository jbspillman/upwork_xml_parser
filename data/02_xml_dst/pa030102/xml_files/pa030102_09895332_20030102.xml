<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an autonomous flying wing or like unmanned aerial vehicle and more particularly but not exclusively to an autonomous flying wing or like unmanned aerial vehicle which is collapsible for storage and delivery. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> It is often necessary to survey regions of the earth&apos;s surface from the air, for example when looking for survivors of lost ships or aircraft, or following earthquakes or natural disasters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Aerial reconnaissance is as old as flight itself but large-scale reconnaissance is generally limited by the availability of manpower and aircraft. Furthermore it is expensive to keep a manned aircraft in the air, and in certain circumstances it may even be particularly dangerous, for example if the reconnaissance is being carried out over enemy territory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Thus, in recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles and micro-vehicles such as the autonomous flying wing have been developed. The autonomous flying wing is much smaller than a conventional aircraft because it does not have to carry a human pilot. Although it is powered, its power requirements are considerably lower than any conventional aircraft and its manufacturing cost is orders of magnitude lower. It is generally delivered to a deployment zone by a conventional aircraft, following which it is released and, because of its small size and low cost, it can be deployed in much larger numbers than has heretofore been possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Nevertheless, one of the limitations in the use of an autonomous flying wing is ease of deployment, in particular the number of such flying wings that can be deployed from a single conventional aircraft or that can be stored in a single conventional underwing pod. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Reference is now made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, which is a simplified perspective view from above of an autonomous flying wing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to which the present invention may be applied. The wing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a central portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which typically includes an engine <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and a controller (not shown). The controller may be a programmable computer and more particularly an avionics control and command center as is well known in the art of unmanned aerial vehicles. The wing may typically also include sensors and other devices, as necessary for the mission, which are preferably operated by the controller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the controller controls the operation of the flying wing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, as well known in the art of unmanned aerial vehicles. The controller can be preprogrammed, such that no remote control is required. The controller can alternatively communicate with a remote station via a receiver for receiving operational commands, which are then translated into control commands, affecting the performance, e.g., flight course, of the flying wing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. To this end, wing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is preferably equipped with an antenna (not shown) operatively communicating with the receiver. The antenna is preferably connected to ailerons <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The controller is preferably in control of the folding and unfolding process of the wings, as will be discussed below, however local control is also applicable. The controller preferably includes a transmitter for real-time reporting to a remote station, which remote station can be air-borne. The controller effectively controls the operation of any payload and other components and functions of autonomous flying wing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> On either side of the central portion, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, are wing halves <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> each wing half is formed of two wing portions, an inner wing portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and an outer wing portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. In the configuration shown the inner wing portions <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are angled gently upwardly and the outer wing portions <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, are angled gently downwardly. Such a configuration is known as a seagull wing and has particularly aerodynamically favorable characteristics. However, the skilled person will appreciate that the invention is not limited to such a configuration, and may equally well include wing portions being placed at different angles or wherein the entire wing is substantially planar. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The engine <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> preferably operates a driving mechanism, not shown but also located in the central portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The drive mechanism is operatively held by the central portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and serves for providing the autonomous flying wing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with a drive force. The drive mechanism can be located anywhere within the central portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, however, according to a presently preferred configuration, the drive mechanism is located aft. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The engine <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is preferably an electrical motor, however, liquid-fuel operated motors are also envisaged. To power the engine, autonomous flying wing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> further includes a power source, which serves for powering the engine <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The power source can include, for example, a plurality of electrically connected batteries, which can be distributed at various locations along the wings <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to provide autonomous flying wing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with a required weight balance and to efficiently employ the small space within the autonomous flying wing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The drive mechanism may, in one preferred embodiment, be a propeller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, there is provided a non-motorized air gliding autonomous flying wing. Such air gliding autonomous flying wings <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be dropped from an airplane or other air-borne platform at medium to high altitude (e.g., about 20,000 feet) and glide for long distances for several hours. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, autonomous flying wing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a payload. Any payload can be used, one example is a camera. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> According to preferred embodiments, the overall weight of wing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is between 3-7 Kg, it operates at about 30-80 km/hour, at altitude of 0-7000 m, for 3-15 hours non-stop. Reference is now made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, which is a simplified view from above of the wing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Parts that are identical to those shown above are given the same reference numerals and are not referred to again except as necessary for an understanding of the present embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows the swept back configuration of the wing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Inner wing portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is pivotally connected to central portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at one end and to outer wing portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> at the other end. Likewise, inner wing portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is pivotally connected to central portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at one end and to outer wing portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> at the other end. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Reference is now made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, which are simplified views from in front and behind respectively of a wing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Parts that are identical to those shown above are given the same reference numerals and are not referred to again except as necessary for an understanding of the present embodiment. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, the angles at which the wing portions are able to pivot with respect to each other are shown by arrows. Arrow <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>indicates how wing portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> pivots around central portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to a substantially vertical position, and arrow <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>shows how inner wing portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> pivots around central portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, also to a substantially vertical portion, such that the two central portions lie on top of each other when folded. Outer wing portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> pivots, as indicated by arrow <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, so that it is aligned with inner wing portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and likewise, outer wing portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> pivots, as indicated by arrow <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, so as to align with inner wing portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, so that the two outer wing portions also lie on top of each other and form a linear continuation of the two inner wing portions <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Thus, the wing may be folded from a seagull orientation to a straight-line orientation having a length which is half that of the total length of the wings when held flat and a thickness twice that of an unfolded wing, the depth remaining unchanged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that, as an alternative, the outer wing portions <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> could be folded back on the inner wing portions <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> respectively and this would reduce the folded length. However, this would give a thickness of four times the initial wing thickness over part of the length and, as will be seen below, such a configuration is not optimal for stowage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Reference is now made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, which are simplified schematic diagrams showing the folding process described with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>. Parts that are identical to those shown above are given the same reference numerals and are not referred to again except as necessary for an understanding of the present embodiment. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the wing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is shown in the seagull configuration. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>the wing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is shown in an intermediate state with the inner wing portions <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> folded together and the outer wing portions <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> still unfolded. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, the outer wing portions <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are also folded, forming a single straight unit, which is half the length of the flat wing, although longer than half the wingtip-to-wingtip length in the seagull configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In a particular embodiment of the seagull configuration, a total wingtip-to-wingtip length of 2.14 m gives a total folded length of 1.20 m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Reference is now made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, which are simplified views of a storage unit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> for storing a folded autonomous flying wing of the type described above. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is a simplified side perspective view of the storage unit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is a front view of the storage unit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is a side view thereof. The storage unit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is an irregular octagon, and as orientated with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the octagon is flattened in the x-axis, extended in the z-axis, and in the y direction, it is extended in the positive y direction and flattened in the negative y direction. The angles of the walls in the negative y direction are selected to define a segment of a circle, so as to assist in storage, as will be described below. In the z direction (the x direction of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) the device is tapered towards one end. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The storage unit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is thus shaped to contain the folded wing, and is designed to be placed radially with other storage units in a compartment of an underwing pod of a conventional aircraft, as will be described below. A release mechanism, which may be part of the autonomous flying wing stored therein or of the storage unit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> or of the pod, opens the storage unit to expel the wing therefrom during deployment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In the numerical example given above, wherein the wing had a total folded length of 1.20 m, typical dimensions for the storage unit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> might be 0.30 m&times;0.11 m&times;1.40 m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Reference is now made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, which is a simplified cutaway perspective view of an underwing pod <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> for use with a conventional aircraft. The pod comprises a generally cylindrical outer shell <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> having elongated front and rear ends <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and a hollow interior space for storage. A first plurality of containers <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are preferably arranged radially around the center of the pod, at a forward end, as indicated by reference numeral <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Further sets of radially arranged containers, <highlight><bold>582</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can be arranged further back along the pod <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Using the numerical dimensions given with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, and a standard 600-gallon pod, a total of 12 containers <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be arranged radially together and three sets of radial arrangements <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> can be fitted lengthwise in the pod <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> giving a total of <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> autonomous flying wings per pod <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Additional space at the rear end <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the pod <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may store air-braking devices such as a parachute (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Reference is now made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, which is a front view of a set of containers <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> radially arranged within a pod <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Parts that are identical to those shown above are given the same reference numerals and are not referred to again except as necessary for an understanding of the present embodiment. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows how the shape of the containers <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, as described in respect of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, allows them to be fitted in such a way that optimal use is made of the cylindrical space within the pod. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In use, the autonomous flying wings <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are folded and placed inside containers <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The containers <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are then placed inside a pod <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, as described with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference> and the pod is mounted on the underwing of a conventional aircraft for deployment. The conventional aircraft reaches a deployment zone and deploys the autonomous flying wings in any one of a number of ways known to the skilled person. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In one preferred embodiment, deployment of the flying wing comprises the following steps: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> 1) the entire pod is released from the underwing; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> 2) a parachute, attached to the pod, opens; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> 3) the cylindrical outer covering of the pod is released, this may typically be spring activated, or activated by action of the parachute or may be caused by inflation of an air pillow or the like; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> 4) the containers are then given a chance to disperse; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> 5) a small explosive charge breaks open each container and unfolds the autonomous flying wing therein, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> 6) the controller and the engine <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of each flying wing is started. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Some of the above processes may be initiated by air pressure. Alternatively, they may be initiated in accordance with preprogrammed time delays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In greater detail, pod <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is preferably equipped with an air brake device such as a deployable parachute in its rear end <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. Launching of autonomous flying wing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is effected by dropping pod <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> from the conventional aircraft, launching it from a surface launcher or hand launching it from the surface (e.g., ground). It will be appreciated by the skilled person that in all cases where an entire pod <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is launched, it is also possible to launch a single container <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. A string connected at one end to the pod <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and at its other end to the conventional aircraft etc. operates a release mechanism to automatically deploy the parachute. As a result, one end of the pod faces downwards as the cylindrical covering is released. Dispersal of the containers <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be effected by a combination of gravity and wind resistance and may be assisted by the explosion of a small charge. When dispersing, a mechanism, which may be based on time delay or on air pressure or the like, opens the containers <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. When the flying wing is released from the container, a mechanism, such as a string mechanism operated by the opening of the container <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, operates the controller of the flying wing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The first task of the controller is to unfold the wing. The pivotal connections are preferably motorized and the controller operates actuators to rotate the wing sections about their pivotal connections until the seagull configuration is attained. Latches preferably fix each joint in position once the desired configuration is reached. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The controller may typically be preprogrammed with a mission such as &ldquo;carry out a photographic survey of the region between map references A and B&rdquo;. Often it is possible to program each autonomous flying wing individually before take-off or by radio contact after deployment but in certain circumstances final details may be available only whilst delivery is taking place and radio contact may be inconvenient or not possible. Thus, one embodiment of the present invention provides in-flight programming of an autonomous flying vehicle or flying wing, including an autonomous micro-vehicle, from the cockpit of the delivery aircraft. Such programming may be carried out via a data link between the cockpit and the underwing pod <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The link may be hardwired. Alternatively, in one preferred embodiment the link is wireless. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Reference is now made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, which is a simplified block diagram of a programming connection utilizing a wireless link, operative in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. An input device <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is located in the cockpit or other manned location on the conventional aircraft, allowing the pilot or other crew member to input data for programming as part of the mission. A processor <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is connected to the input device and processes input data from the input device <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, together with any other relevant data, into a mission blueprint for one or more of the flying wings <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> . . . <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>.<highlight><italic>n. </italic></highlight>The mission blueprint is then modulated for transmission via a wireless transmitter <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, which is preferably externally mounted on the pod. The transmitter <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> may be an infrared, microwave, RF or any other suitable transmitter and a corresponding receiver <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> may be placed on each wing for receipt and demodulation of the blueprint. The blueprint preferably contains addressing information, which may be decoded at addressing logic <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> within each wing. The addressing logic preferably allows the intended flying wing or wings <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> . . . <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>.<highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>to identify those messages intended therefor and to ignore those messages not intended therefor. The decoded address may sometimes specify more than one flying wing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> . . . <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>.<highlight><italic>n. </italic></highlight>Preferably, the addressing logic <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> may comprise a rejection gate located at each flying wing, which simply rejects messages not correctly addressed, the receiver sending all blueprints to all wings <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> . . . <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>.<highlight><italic>n. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> In the event that several pods are being used, a preferred embodiment simply sends all data to each pod and each respective transmitter transmits all of the data, leaving the individual wings to determine which messages are relevant. Thus there is achieved integrated operation of wings from a plurality of pods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The transmitter preferably uses IR with a high frequency carrier and low frequency modulation, thereby overcoming problems due to fading and interference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Thus, a programmer based on the aircraft is able to program the flying wings in flight and prior to deployment. As mentioned above, the pod is preferably arranged such that a single program can be sent to all of the flying wings or alternatively so that the flying wings can be addressed individually or in groups. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Typical applications for flying wings include civilian and military reconnaissance missions. The reconnaissance missions may include nighttime reconnaissance using FLIR or image intensifier apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> According to a further embodiment of the present invention there is provided a method of aerial screening of a land or sea region. The method is effected by implementing the following method steps. In a first step, a plurality of unmanned collapsible flying wings are provided in a collapsed configuration in a pod and borne by a conventional aircraft to a deployment zone. Alternatively, they may be borne to the deployment zone in other ways, as mentioned above. Then, the pod is launched and the collapsible flying wings are opened and deployed from the pod, to enable each of the plurality of collapsible flying wings for airborne use. Finally, the plurality of unmanned aerial vehicles navigates to screen the region through different types of sensors. It will be appreciated that the method according to the present invention is applicable for both civil and military applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> According to a further embodiment of the present invention there is provided another method of aerial screening of a land or sea region. In a first step, a plurality of collapsible flying wings is provided in a collapsed state on an airborne platform. Then, the plurality of unmanned aerial vehicles are dropped from the airborne platform whilst at the same time unfolding into an operational state, to enable each of the plurality of unmanned aerial vehicles for air-borne operation. Finally, the plurality of unmanned aerial vehicles navigates to screen the region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> It is appreciated that certain features of the invention, which are, for clarity, described in the context of separate embodiments, may also be provided in combination in a single embodiment. Conversely, various features of the invention, which are, for brevity, described in the context of a single embodiment, may also be provided separately or in any suitable subcombination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that the present invention is not limited to what has been particularly shown and described hereinabove. Rather the scope of the present invention is defined by the appended claims and includes both combinations and subcombinations of the various features described hereinabove as well as variations and modifications thereof, which would occur to persons skilled in the art upon reading the foregoing description. </paragraph>
