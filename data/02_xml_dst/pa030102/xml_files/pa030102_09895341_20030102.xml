<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to the fabrication of planar lightwave circuits. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method and system for fabricating a silica glass cap for an optical waveguide core of a planar lightwave circuit. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Planar lightwave circuits comprise fundamental building blocks for the modern fiber optic communications infrastructure. Planar lightwave circuits are generally devices configured to transmit light in a manner analogous to the transmission of electrical currents in printed circuit boards and integrated circuit devices. Examples include arrayed waveguide grating devices, integrated wavelength multiplexers/demultiplexers, optical switches, optical modulators, attenuators, wavelength-independent optical couplers, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Planar lightwave circuits (PLCs) generally involve the provisioning of a series of embedded optical waveguides upon a semiconductor substrate (e.g., silicon). PLCs are constructed using the advanced tools and technologies developed by the semiconductor industry. Modern semiconductor electronics fabrication technology can aggressively address the increasing need for integration and is currently being used to make planar light circuits. By using manufacturing techniques closely related to those employed for silicon integrated circuits, a variety of optical elements can be placed and interconnected on the surface of a silicon wafer or similar substrate. This technology has only recently emerged and is advancing rapidly with leverage from the more mature tools of the semiconductor-processing industry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A conventional PLC optical waveguide comprises a substrate (e.g., silicon) with a un-doped silica glass bottom clad formed thereon, at least one waveguide core formed on the bottom clad, and a top clad covering the waveguide core and the bottom clad, wherein a certain amount of at least one dopant is added to the waveguide core so that the refractive index of the waveguide core is higher than that of the top clad and bottom clad. The waveguide cores are formed by etching their profile from a core layer (e.g., doped SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>glass) deposited over the bottom clad. The core layer is then heated to more than 1000 C. to stabilize its refractive index. The core layer is patterned by, for example, reactive-ion etching to remove the excess doped SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>glass, and thereby define the profile of one or more waveguide cores. An SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>cladding layer is then formed (e.g., by flame deposition). The optical waveguide is subsequently heated to a temperature of more than 1000&deg; C. to stabilize the refractive index of the top clad and to make the top clad more homogenous. Finally, the wafer is diced cut into multiple PLC dies and packaged according to their particular applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Prior art <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a cross-section view of a conventional planar optical waveguide. As depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the planar optical waveguide includes a doped SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>glass core <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> formed over a SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>silica glass bottom clad <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>top clad <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> covers both the waveguide core <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the bottom clad <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. As described above, the refractive index of the core <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is higher than that of the top clad <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the bottom clad <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Consequently, optical signals are confined axially within core <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and propagate lengthwise through core <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Top clad <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is formed using a very gradual top clad &ldquo;buildup&rdquo; process, wherein a number of deposition and anneal cycles are used to gradually buildup the thickness of the top clad layer. Successive thin top clad layers (e.g., typically 4 layers at minimum) are deposited and annealed in order to make the top clad more homogenous and avoid the formation of defects (e.g., voids, crystallization areas, etc.) and to stabilize the refractive index of top clad <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The use of multiple deposition and anneal cycles is also effective in filling high aspect ratio gaps, wherein a number of waveguide cores are located closely together and the top clad deposition process needs to effectively fill these gaps between the waveguide cores. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> There exists a problem however, in maintaining a precise waveguide core profile through successive anneal cycles. During the top clad buildup process, each time a thin layer of the top clad is deposited (e.g., using PECVD), it subsequently treated with a high temperature anneal cycle (e.g., 1000-1200 C.). The high temperature anneal cycle is used to fix the refractive index of the newly deposited layer and to reflow the layer into gaps. Unfortunately, the high temperature anneal cycle also tends to cause some degradation in the shape of the waveguide core. For example, instead of maintaining its precise rectangular shape, after three or more anneal cycles, waveguide core <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be deformed, losing its precisely defined rectangular shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Prior art <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a cross-section diagram of a waveguide core <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> having undergone significant deformation due to multiple high-temperature anneal cycles. As depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the vertical sides of waveguide core <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are deformed, as waveguide core <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> &ldquo;reflows&rdquo; and settles due to gravity under the high temperatures (e.g., 1000 C. or above). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Prior art <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</cross-reference> show cross-section photographs of waveguide cores showing similar types of deformation due to the high temperature anneal cycles. As with waveguide core <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, temperatures near or above the waveguide core&apos;s reflow temperature causes deformation, particularly in the waveguide core sidewalls. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Waveguide core deformation is a significant problem for several types of high-performance PLCs. For example, arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) PLCs are one of the most precisely manufactured PLCs, and are used to implement multiplexing or demultiplexing functions within a fiber-optic network. A typical AWG device is configured for multiplexing or demultiplexing, for example, 16 channels with a separation of 100 gigahertz between the channels. AWG devices having 40 channels spaced at 50 gigahertz are commercially available, and even more advanced devices having 128 channels spaced at 25 gigahertz have been demonstrated. The performance of such advanced AWG devices (e.g., 40 channels or more) is critically dependent upon the performance of the semiconductor manufacturing technologies used to fabricate them. For example, a <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> channel AWG device will have at least 128 precisely defined optical waveguides fabricated therein. Waveguide core deformations or other such imperfections are likely to have very significant impacts upon the performance of the AWG device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Additionally, other types of PLCs (e.g., couplers, optical switches, etc.) depend upon precisely defined waveguide cores located very close together, to form a coupling region. The transfer of light across this coupling region is dependent upon the precise dimensions of the waveguides in the coupling region. Waveguide core deformation in the coupling region can render the resulting device inoperative. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Thus what is needed is a solution that can effectively protect the profile of waveguide cores during top clad anneal. What is needed is a solution that can protect the profile of waveguide cores during multiple anneal cycles, as used in a top clad buildup process. Additionally, the required solution should not interfere with the performance of the completed optical waveguides. The present invention provides a novel solution to the above requirements. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Reference will now be made in detail to the embodiments of the invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. While the invention will be described in conjunction with the preferred embodiments, it will be understood that they are not intended to limit the invention to these embodiments. On the contrary, the invention is intended to cover alternatives, modifications and equivalents, which may be included within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. Furthermore, in the following detailed description of the present invention, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, it will be obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well known methods, procedures, components, and circuits have not been described in detail as not to obscure aspects of the present invention unnecessarily. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of the present invention are directed towards a method of fabricating a cap layer over a waveguide core in order to protect the profile of waveguide core during top clad anneal. The present invention protects the profile of waveguide cores during multiple anneal cycles, as used in a top clad buildup process. Additionally, the present invention does not interfere with the performance of the completed optical waveguides. The present invention and its benefits are further described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows a cross-section view of an optical waveguide structure <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. As depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, optical waveguide structure <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is shown in a state subsequent to etching to remove a core layer used to form waveguide core <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, hereafter referred to as core <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. The core <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> is formed over a bottom clad layer <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>. Core <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> is a doped silica glass core (e.g., Germanium dopant, Phosphorus dopant, or the like) in accordance with the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> It should be appreciated that the major steps of silicon oxide deposition, photolithography, and fabrication are well known and widely used in planar lightwave circuit fabrication. Accordingly, such steps will not be described in extensive detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Referring still <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, during fabrication, a core layer is formed on bottom clad <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>, wherein the core layer has a higher refractive index than bottom clad <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>. Bottom clad layer <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> can be a silicon dioxide layer formed over a silicon substrate (not shown). Core <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> is then formed from the core layer using an etching process. As is well known in the art, once the core layer is deposited and annealed, a mask (not shown) is formed over the core layer using photolithography techniques. The unmasked areas of the core layer are then etched away to define the shape of core <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. The mask is subsequently removed from core <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, such that the optical waveguide structure <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> appears as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> shows core <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> after deposition of a cap layer <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight>. A silica glass cap layer <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> is formed over the core <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and bottom clad <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>. The silica glass cap layer can be deposited using PECVD (plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition) and other similar process. The silica glass cap layer can be between 0.3 to 2 microns thick. In this embodiment, the silica glass cap layer is undoped silica glass (USG). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference> shows a cap <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> formed from the cap layer <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight>. Once the layer <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> is deposited, a mask (not shown) is formed over the cap layer (e.g., using photolithography techniques). The unmasked areas of the cap layer <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> are then etched away to remove that portion of cap layer <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> covering the bottom clad <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>, thus defining the shape of cap <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>. The mask is subsequently removed from cap <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>, such that the optical waveguide structure appears as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A through 6C</cross-reference> depict a top clad deposition process wherein a number of deposition and anneal steps are used to buildup a top clad over core <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and cap <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>. A well known problem with the fabrication of planar optical waveguide devices is the gap fill of high aspect ratio areas. To solve this problem, a very gradual top clad &ldquo;buildup&rdquo; process is used, wherein a number of deposition and anneal cycles are used to gradually buildup the thickness of the top clad layer. Successive thin top clad layers (e.g., typically <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> layers at minimum) are deposited and annealed in an attempt to avoid the formation of voids. Three such layers <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight> are shown. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference> shows a top clad layer <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> over core <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and cap <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>. After deposition and anneal of layer <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight>, a second layer <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> is deposited and annealed, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</cross-reference> shows a third layer <highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight> deposited over the first layer <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> and second layer <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In this manner, the gradual top clad buildup process proceeds until the top clad is at the desired thickness. As known by those skilled in the art, the high temperature anneal cycles fix the refractive index of the deposited layers <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight> and promotes more effective gap filling. In accordance with the present invention, the protective cap <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> prevents degradation in the shape of core <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> during each of the successive anneal cycles for the top clad. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The USG cap <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> generally has a higher reflow temperature than core <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> to prevent deformation of the profile core <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. The USG cap <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> also can prevent diffusion of dopant between core <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and the top clad (e.g., top clad layers <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight>). The higher reflow temperature of the USG cap <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> protects the profile of waveguide cores during multiple anneal cycles, as used in the top clad buildup process, since cap <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> will tend to &ldquo;contain&rdquo; core <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> as core <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> reaches its lower reflow temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Thus, cap <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> maintains the precise profile of core <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> through successive high temperature anneal cycles (e.g., 1000-1200 C.). The annealing procedure can proceed at higher temperatures and for a longer duration, wherein the top clad layers and the core <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> are repeatedly heated to temperatures above 1000 C. and the cap structure protects the shape of the waveguide core. The high temperatures are used to expel the undesired chemical substance, such as the radicals with bonded hydrogen, and to reduce the inhomogenities of refractive index within the top clad. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the thickness of the cap layer <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference>) should be configured to provide containment for core <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> while at the same time minimizing its effect on the optical properties of core <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. For example, as the thickness of cap layer <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> increases, the amount of birefringence caused by cap layer <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> increases. Simultaneously, the degree of protection for the shape of core <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> also increases. In the present embodiment, the optimum thickness of cap layer <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> is in a range from 0.5 microns to 1.5 microns. Thicknesses below 0.5 microns cannot provide an adequate amount of protection for core <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. The thicknesses above 1.5 microns introduce too much birefringence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Thus, the present invention provides a method of fabricating a cap layer over a waveguide core in order to protect the profile of waveguide core during top clad anneal. The present invention protects the profile of waveguide cores during multiple anneal cycles, as used in a top clad buildup process. Additionally, the present invention does not interfere with the performance of the completed optical waveguides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The foregoing descriptions of specific embodiments of the present invention have been presented for purposes of illustration and description. They are not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed, and obviously many modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teaching.
