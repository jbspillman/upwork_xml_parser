<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> As integrated circuits such as, for example, microprocessors and microcontrollers, become more advanced, it becomes increasingly more important and more difficult to test the integrated circuits. This difficulty is due, at least in part, to the increasing complexity of the integrated circuit between its sources of input and the output provided by the integrated circuit. In other words, the internal workings of an integrated circuit become more complex. This, in turn, may make it more difficult to control the inputs or predict the output of the integrated circuit by altering the input sequence to the integrated circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> One technique that may be used to test the operability of an integrated circuit is to place the integrated circuit into a scan mode. In such a test mode, the clock of the integrated circuit is slowly cycled while a known input stream is fed to the integrated circuit. While the input test data is provided to the integrated circuit, the output of the integrated circuit is monitored to verify if the integrated circuit is operating within acceptable parameters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> However, one problem with using scan mode is that the all portions or subcircuits may not be operating in the same time domain or processing data at the same speed. Consequently, race-through conditions may exist where data is provided to some parts of the integrated circuit either earlier or later than expected. One possible solution to address this is to add circuitry (e.g. delay transistors) that may be used to reduce the risk of race-through. However, the addition of such circuitry may add to both the power consumption and manufacturing cost of the integrated circuit. Thus, there is a continuing need for better ways to test integrated circuits while addressing at least some of the problems associated with race-through.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> in the following detailed description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. However, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known methods, procedures, components and circuits have not been described in detail so as not to obscure the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Unless specifically stated otherwise, as apparent from the following discussions, it is appreciated that throughout the specification discussions utilizing terms such as &ldquo;processing,&rdquo; &ldquo;computing,&rdquo; &ldquo;calculating,&rdquo; &ldquo;determining,&rdquo; or the like, refer to the action and/or processes of a computer or computing system, or similar electronic computing device, that manipulate and/or transform data represented as physical, such as electronic, quantities within the computing system&apos;s registers and/or memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computing system&apos;s memories, registers or other such information storage, transmission or display devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of the present invention may include apparatuses for performing the operations herein. This apparatus may be specially constructed for the desired purposes, or it may comprise a general purpose computing device selectively activated or reconfigured by a program stored in the device. Such a program may be stored on a storage medium, such as, but is not limited to, any type of disk including floppy disks, optical disks, CD-ROMs, magnetic-optical disks, read-only memories (ROMs), random access memories (RAMs), electrically programmable read-only memories (EPROMs), electrically erasable and programmable read only memories (EEPROMs), magnetic or optical cards, or any other type of media suitable for storing electronic instructions, and capable of being coupled to a system bus for a computing device. </paragraph>

It should be understood that these terms are not intended as synonyms for each other. Rather, in particular embodiments, &ldquo;connected&rdquo; may be used to indicate that two or more elements are in direct physical or electrical contact with each other. &ldquo;Coupled&rdquo; may mean that two or more elements are in direct physical or electrical contact. However, &ldquo;coupled&rdquo; may also mean that two or more elements are not in direct contact with each other, but yet still co-operate or interact with each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Note, in this description a &ldquo;&num;&rdquo; symbol may be used to indicate the logical complement of a signal. For example, if BL is a logic &ldquo;1,&rdquo; then BL&num; may be a logic &ldquo;0,&rdquo; although this invention is not limited to any particular signaling scheme. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Turning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an embodiment <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in accordance with the present invention is described. Embodiment <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may comprise a portable device <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> such as a mobile communication device (e.g., cell phone), a two-way radio communication system, a one-way pager, a two-way pager, a personal communication system (PCS), a portable computer, or the like. Although it should be understood that the scope and application of the present invention is in no way limited to these examples. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Embodiment <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> here includes an integrated circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> that may comprise, for example, a microprocessor, a digital signal processor, a microcontroller, or the like. However, it should be understood that only a portion of integrated circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is included in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and that the scope of the present invention is not limited to these examples. Embodiment <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may also optionally include other components such as a display <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and memory <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (e.g. RAM or non-volatile memory). Memory <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be used to store instructions to be executed by integrated circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and display <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> may present the results of the execution of those instructions to a user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, an embodiment of a flip-flop <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in accordance with the present invention is provided. In this embodiment, Integrated circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may comprise one or more flip-flops such as flip-flop <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. As will be explained in more detail below, flip-flop <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may operate differently depending on the operation mode of integrated circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. For example, if integrated circuit is in a test mode, or some other mode where part of the functionality of integrated circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or embodiment <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is being verified, flip-flop <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may operate as a master-slave flip-flop. Additionally, flip-flop <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may operate as a pulsed latch when integrated circuit when integrated circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is not being tested (e.g. a normal operation mode). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Flip-flop <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may include a master circuit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and a slave circuit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> that may be used to provide input to other circuits within integrated circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (not shown) while integrated circuit is in a test mode. The use of master circuit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and slave circuit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> may reduce the risk of a race through condition while the operation of integrated circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is being verified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Master circuit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may receive two or more clock signals (i.e. SCAN_CLOCK <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and SCAN_CLOCK&num; <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>) that may be used to provide a test input value (i.e. SCAN_INPUT <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>) to master circuit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and then slave circuit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. Although the scope of the present invention is not necessarily limited in this respect, SCAN_CLOCK <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and SCAN_CLOCK <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> may be clock signals with a predetermined periodicity and be generated such that they do not have overlapping transitions. In other words, the clock signals may be generated such that only one of them transition from high to low state, or vice-versa, while the other clock signal is remains at the same logical level. This may allow each signal to control or trigger a particular result within flip-flop <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> or integrated circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> so that the flow of data may be synchronized. This may be desirable in some particular embodiments to reduce the risk of a race-through condition as will become apparent below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> While integrated circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is in a test mode, a transistor <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> may be used to control when SCAN_INPUT is stored on a storage element <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. Storage element <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> may be provided by using a variety of techniques such as two or more inverters arranged in a feedback loop as shown, although the scope of the present invention is not limited in this respect. In alternative embodiments, other circuits, such as registers, latches, RAM, etc., may be used. Thus, when SCAN_CLOCK&num; is a high logic level, SCAN_INPUT <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> may be stored in storage circuit <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. Note, in this particular embodiment, although the scope of the present invention is not limited in this respect, transistor <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is disabled since SCAN_CLOCK <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is the logic low state. This, in turn, may reduce the risk of the SCAN_INPUT <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> data from racing through to slave circuit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> After the test data (i.e., SCAN_INPUT <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>) has been stored in storage unit <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, the data may be provided to slave circuit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> on a subsequent transition of SCAN_CLOCK <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. When SCAN_CLOCK <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> transitions to a high logic level, transistor <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> may be enabled to allow provide slave circuit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> with the data stored in storage unit <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. Thus, clock signals SCAN_CLOCK <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and SCAN_CLOCK <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> may be used to control the flow of test input data to slave circuit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. Slave circuit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> may, in turn, store the test input data and provide that data as an output signal (i.e. OUTPUT <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>) to other portions of integrated circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Slave circuit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> may comprise a storage unit that may be used to store the input value provided to flip-flop <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Although the scope of the present invention is not limited in this respect, an inverter <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> and transistors <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> may be used to retain or store the logic value provided by master circuit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Slave circuit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> may also comprise an inverter <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> that may be used to drive and provide OUTPUT <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> to the other portions of integrated circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In this particular embodiment, transistors <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> are n-channel transistors that may be enabled when a high logic level is applied to their respective gate terminals. However, it should be understood that in alternative embodiments transistors <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and/or <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> may be p-channel transistors that are enabled by the opposite logic level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Turning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, an example of how flip-flop <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may operate while integrated circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is in a test mode is provided. As shown, at time, T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, SCAN_CLOCK&num; is a logic high value. Consequently, the value of SCAN_INPUT may be stored in storage unit <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. Once SCAN_CLOCK&num; transitions to a low logic value, the data in storage unit <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> remains the same even if the value of SCAN_INPUT changes. On the subsequent rising transition of SCAN_CLOCK, (i.e. time T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) the data in storage unit <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> is provide to slave circuit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> (i.e., at node labeled QZ in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). Slave circuit <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> stores the value provided by master circuit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and provides the new logic as OUTPUT to other portion of integrated circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Note, the logical value of OUTPUT does not change until after a subsequent transition in SCAN_CLOCK (i.e. time T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>). It should be noted that in this example the clock signal, CLOCK, which may be coupled to the other portions of flip-flop <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, remained at a low logic level. This should be considered optional and may be desirable to reduce the risk that changes in the input signal DATA affect the operation of flip-flop <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> while integrated circuit is in a test mode or it otherwise not in a normal operation mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Turning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> clock circuit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> that may be used to generate clock signals in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention is described. However, it should be understood that the scope of the present invention is not limited so as to require the use of this particular circuit. In alternative embodiments, other circuits may be used. As shown, a CLOCK_INPUT <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> may be used to provide the transitions for SCAN_CLOCK <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and SCAN_CLOCK&num; <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. An inverter <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> may be used so that that SCAN_CLOCK <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and SCAN_CLOCK&num; <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are typically the logical complements of each other. In addition, one or more inverters <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> may be used to determine the amount of delay between a transition in one clock signal and a subsequent transition in the other clock signal. The non-overlap time may be proportional to the number of inverters <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>. Thus, in this particular embodiment, the clock signals SCAN_CLOCK <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and SCAN_CLOCK&num; <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> have non-overlapping transitions (i.e., only one of the clock signals changes at a time). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Clock circuit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> may also optionally comprise NAND gates <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> and use an enable signal (i.e. SCANENABLE) that may be used to control when the clock signals SCAN_CLOCK <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and SCAN_CLOCK&num; <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are generated. For example, although the scope of the present invention is not limited in this respect, clock circuit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> may only be enabled by SCANENABLE and may only generate clock signal when integrated circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is in a test mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Returning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the operation of flip-flop <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> while integrated circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is not in a test mode is described. When the operation of integrated circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is not being verified (i.e., integrated circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is in normal operation and is executing instructions), flip-flop <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may operate as a pulsed latch. In normal operation, a clock signal (e.g., CLOCK <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>) may be used to control when the input logic value, DATA <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>, is stored in slave circuit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. In this mode of operation, flip-flop <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may be referred to as a pulsed latch because a clock signal having a relatively short duty cycle may be used to control when an input signal (e.g. DATA <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>) is stored in slave circuit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> of flip-flop <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. For example, CLOCK <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> may have a duty cycle of less than thirty percent. This may be desirable to reduce the power consumption of flip-flop <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and integrated circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the logic value of DATA <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> is only provided to and stored in slave circuit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> when CLOCK <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is a high logic level. This is due, at least in part, to the presence of an inverter <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>. In alternative embodiments, inverter <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> may be removed or positioned elsewhere so that the input data is stored in slave <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> when CLOCK <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is a low logic level. Note, while integrated circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is in normal operation mode, it may be desirable to disable the generation of the scan clock signals SCAN_CLOCK <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and SCAN_CLOCK <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> so that changes in the input signal SCAN_INPUT do not interfere with the operation of flip-flop <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, when integrated circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is in a test mode, scan clock signals SCAN_CLOCK <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and SCAN_CLOCK&num; <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> may be used to provide and control when test data is presented to slave circuit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. When integrated circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is in normal operation, clock signal CLOCK <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> may be used to control and determine when input data is provided to slave circuit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> flip-flop <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> in accordance with an alternative embodiment of the present invention is described. Flip-flop <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> may comprise a master circuit <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight> that may provide an input logic value that is stored in a slave circuit <highlight><bold>580</bold></highlight>. In this particular embodiment, master circuit <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight> has an input node or port that may be connected to one or more sources of input signals. In this example, master circuit <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight> may be connected to a test input circuit <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> and an operational input circuit <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> When integrated circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) is in normal mode of operation (i.e. executing instructions), operational input circuit <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> may provide input to master circuit <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight>. For example, a clock signal (i.e. CLOCK <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>) may be used to provide an input data signal (i.e. DATA <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>) to the input of master circuit <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight>. When not in test mode, the scan enable signal (SCANENABLE <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>) may be at a low logic level so that DATA <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> may be provided to master circuit <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight> when CLOCK <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> is at low logic value. Master circuit <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight> may store this logic value in a storage circuit <highlight><bold>561</bold></highlight> so that the data may be stored in slave circuit <highlight><bold>580</bold></highlight> when CLOCK <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> subsequently transitions to a high logic value. In this particular embodiment, storage circuit <highlight><bold>561</bold></highlight> of master circuit <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight> may comprise an inverter <highlight><bold>562</bold></highlight> and transistors <highlight><bold>563</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>564</bold></highlight>. However, the scope of the present invention is not limited in this respect as storage circuit <highlight><bold>561</bold></highlight> may be implemented using other techniques in alternative embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> When integrated circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> enters a test mode, the SCANENABLE signal may transition to a high logic value. This, in turn, may disable the operation of operational input circuit <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>. In this mode, a scan clock signal (i.e., SCAN_CLOCK <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight>) may be used to control and provide a test input value (i.e., SCAN_INPUT <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight>) to master circuit <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight>. For example, when SCAN_CLOCK <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> is a high logic value, the test input data (i.e., SCAN_INPUT <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight>) is provided to the input node or port of master circuit <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight>. Master circuit <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight> may then store the test input value so that the data may be provided to slave circuit <highlight><bold>580</bold></highlight> when CLOCK <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> subsequently transitions to a high logic level. Thus, SCAN_CLOCK <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> may be used to control when data is stored in master circuit <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight>. CLOCK <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> may be used to determine when the test data is stored in slave circuit <highlight><bold>580</bold></highlight> and provided as an output, OUTPUT <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight> to portions of integrated circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> SCAN_CLOCK <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> and CLOCK <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> may be generated such that they do not have any overlapping transitions. This may be desirable to reduce the risk that there are race-through conditions. For example, as long as CLOCK <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> transitions to a high logic level after SCAN_CLOCK <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> has transitioned to a low logic level, then the data stored in master circuit <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight> will be provided as the output of flip-flop <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight> despite any changes to SCAN_INPUT <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight> or DATA <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>. Thus, when integrated circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is in normal operation, CLOCK <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> may be used to provide DATA <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> to master circuit <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight>, and when integrated circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is in a test mode, SCAN_CLOCK <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> may be used to provide SCAN_INPUT <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight> to master circuit <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6, a</cross-reference> clock generation circuit <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> that may be used to provide the clock signal to flip-flop <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is described. A SCANENABLE signal may be used to enable the operation of clock generation circuit <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> so that SCAN_CLOCK <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> is only generated when integrated circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is in a test mode. As shown a BASECLOCK signal is used to provide the transitions for the generation of SCAN_CLOCK <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> and inverters <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> are used to determine the amount of time or delay between a transition in SCAN_CLOCK <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> and a subsequent transition in CLOCK <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> or vice-versa. Note, clock generation circuit <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> may optionally use a STOPCLOCK signal to indicate that the generation of all clock signals should cease. This may be desirable to reduce the power consumption associated with clock generation when integrated circuit is in a low power mode of operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, particular embodiments of the present invention may be used to test the operability of an integrated circuit. At least some of these embodiments use two clock signals that have non-overlapping transitions to reduce the risk of race-through conditions. While certain features of the invention have been illustrated and described herein, many modifications, substitutions, changes, and equivalents will now occur to those skilled in the art. It is, therefore, to be understood that the appended claims are intended to cover all such modifications and changes as fall within the true spirit of the invention. </paragraph>
