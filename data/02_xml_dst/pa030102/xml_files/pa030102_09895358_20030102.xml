<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Please refer to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. Generally, the conventional mother board for being used in an industrial computer has a standard specification for its size, a mother board A and a backplane B are included therein. The mother board A has a plurality of contact pads A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> A<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and A<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> on the edges thereof. The passive backplane B is capable of being connected to the mother board A and has a front side (not shown), a back side (not shown) and a standardized height of 1U (1.75&Prime;). A first peripheral component interconnection (PCI) port B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a first industry standard architecture (ISA) port B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are provided on a lower portion of the front side, respectively. A second industry standard architecture (ISA) port B<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is provided on an upper portion of the back side and a second peripheral component interconnection (PCI) port B<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is provided on a central portion thereof. Meanwhile, the first PCI port B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is connected to the contact pads A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the mother board A and the first ISA port B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is connected to the contact pads A<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and A<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the mother board A when the backplane B is connected to the mother board A. Moreover, a standardized interface card C can be connected to either the second ISA port B<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> or the second PCI port B<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> on the second side of the backplane B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> However, some interface cards are developed owing to the great progress in the technology of network and communication. The interface card C could be a voice card, a network card, a video display card, a video card, a sound card and so on. The interval between the second ISA port B<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the second PCI port B<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is very narrow under the limit of the standardized height of 1U (1.75&Prime;) in the backplane B; therefore two interface cards fail to be mounted on the second ISA port B<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the second PCI port B<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, respectively. Only a single interface card can be selectively mounted on the second ISA port B<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> or the second PCI port B<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Please refer to FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. A mother board <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for being used in an industrial computer (not shown) includes pins-contact pads <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. A first peripheral component interconnection (PCI) port <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is provided on an upper portion of a back side of a backplane <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The backplane <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is capable of being connected to the pins-contact pads <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the mother board <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and has a height of 1U (1.75&Prime;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, an industry standard architecture (ISA) port <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has terminals <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> on two ends thereof to be mounted and soldered on a front side of the backplane <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and connected to a printed circuit board (PCB) (not shown) for providing a power to the mother board <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> via the terminals <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. The industry standard architecture (ISA) port <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of corresponding holes (not shown) for being inserted by a plurality of terminals (not shown) and only the holes of two ends thereof are inserted by terminals <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the industry standard architecture (ISA) port <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is provided on the backplane <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to form a terminal-less region <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> on the back side of the backplane <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. Moreover, the terminal-less region <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is capable of being provided with a second peripheral component interconnection (PCI) port <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> by soldering terminals <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> thereof, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, the corresponding holes of the industry standard architecture (ISA) port <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can be connected to the pins-contact pads <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> so as to fix the connection between the mother board <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the backplane <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Please refer to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. The industry standard architecture (ISA) port <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is provided on a lower portion of the back side of the backplane <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and includes a central terminal-less section thereof to from the terminal-less region <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The terminal-less region <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> has a height of 1 to 1.2 cm and a length of 11 cm. In addition, the peripheral component interconnection (PCI) port has a standardized size, e.g. 0.9 cm&times;8.4 mm. Consequently, the terminals <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of the second peripheral component interconnection (PCI) port <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is capable of being soldered on the terminal-less region <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> for being electrically connected to other circuits (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> A first interface card <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and a second interface card <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are capable of being mounted on the first peripheral component interconnection (PCI) port <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the second peripheral component interconnection (PCI) port <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, respectively and simultaneously. Furthermore, some standardized electrical components (not shown) are soldered on a surface portion of the second interface card <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and the average thickness thereof is merely 1 cm. The first peripheral component interconnection (PCI) port <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the second peripheral component interconnection (PCI) port <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are separated apart with an interval ranging from 0.8 to 1.5 cm. Therefore, the first interface card <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the second interface card <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> will not interfere each other. Moreover, a horizontal metal piece <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> provided on an edge of the second interface card <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> will not touch the edge of the backplane <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Thus, the connection of the mother board <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the backplane would be not obstructed by the horizontal metal piece <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the second interface card <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The first interface card <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the second interface card <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are capable of being simultaneously mounted on the backplane <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> at the limited height of 1U (1.75&Prime;) for overcoming the disadvantages of the prior art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In this illustrative embodiment, the present invention provides a backplane structure a standardized height of 1U (1.75&Prime;), capable of being mounted with two interface cards thereon. The system efficiency and expansibility in the industrial computer could be enhanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been described in terms of what are presently considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention need not be limited to the disclosed embodiment. On the contrary, it is intended to cover various modifications and similar arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the appended claims which are to be accorded with the broadest interpretation so as to encompass all such modifications and similar structures.
