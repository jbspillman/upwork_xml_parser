<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to microelectromechanical structures (MEMS). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Background </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Communication systems generally require partitioning of the electromagnetic frequency spectrum. Communication transceiver devices therefore must be capable of high frequency selectivity, i.e., capable of selecting a given frequency band while rejecting all others. Frequency-selective devices, such as filters, oscillators and mixers are therefore some of the most important components within a transceiver and the quality of the devices generally dictates the overall architecture of a given transceiver. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In wireless radio frequency (RF) devices, resonators are generally used for signal filtering and generation purposes. The current state of the art typically is the use of discrete crystals to make the resonators (off-chip resonators). To miniaturize devices, MEMS resonators have been contemplated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In a typical resonator, the resonance frequency after processing is usually different from the targeted value due to processing variation. For discrete crystals as mentioned above, such resonance frequency error is usually corrected using laser trimming technology. However, because MEMS resonators (particularly high frequency MEMS resonators) are generally much smaller in size than their crystal counterparts, traditional laser trimming technology is not a viable alternative. One alternative is to remove or add mass to the resonator beam to increase or decrease frequency. However, as beam structures are targeted to micron or submicron sizes as required for ultra-high frequency, it is generally impractical to directly modify the beam. Such modification to the beam thickness tends to be inaccurate. The inaccuracy is believed to be principally due to the sensitivity of the spring constant (k) dependency of the beam thickness. Accordingly, what is needed are techniques to modify the resonance frequency of a resonator.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, a method of modifying the frequency of a resonator is described. Such modification may be suitable, in one example, in MEMS-fabricated resonators wherein a MEMS-fabricated resonator has a frequency that may be a frequency other than the targeted value due to processing variations in the fabrication of the resonator. To achieve the targeted frequency value, a method of modifying the resonator by modifying the support structure is described. An apparatus, such as a resonator, having a frequency determined by the modification of the support structure is also described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> schematically illustrates a chip-based resonator structure that may be used, for example, in a bandpass micromechanical filter. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, structure <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes bridge micromechanical resonator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Resonator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is coupled at anchors <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>B but is otherwise free-standing. The vibration of the resonator is induced by a lateral gap capacitive transducer (a frequency stimulus). The capacitive transducer is formed by disposing electrode <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> adjacent resonator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> with, in this case, gap <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> between electrode <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and resonator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Structure <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is essentially a two-terminal device having a typical equivalent electrical circuit as shown operates in the following representative manner. The circuit has two terminals corresponding to electrode <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and beam <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, respectively, between which the impedance is very high at all frequencies other than the resonance frequency. At the resonance frequency, the resistance between the terminals becomes very low. In the example of use in a filter, an input signal may be passed at the resonance frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> It is appreciated that one desired performance of a resonator structure (such as resonator structure <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) is the ability to limit the resonating frequencies for which the resonator will vibrate and produce a mechanical signal. In the case of an oscillator serving, for example, as part of a clock circuit, it is important that the resonator-based oscillator vibrate at a target clock frequency. In the case of a filter, it may be desirable for a resonator to resonate at target frequencies and pass an input signal, while not vibrating at other frequencies and thus rejecting other input signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> At higher frequencies (e.g., ultra-high frequencies) targeted vibrating frequencies become harder to achieve during fabrication. Continued miniaturization and limits on fabrication technology (e.g., photolithography) performance contribute to the increased error between the targeted frequency and the actual frequency following fabrication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> show a schematic, cross-sectional side view of a micro-bridge resonator, such as a resonator used in the assembly shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows micro-bridge resonator structure <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Micro-bridge resonator structure <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is formed on a portion of substrate <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. Substrate <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is, for example, a semiconductor (e.g., silicon) substrate suitable as a base structure for MEMS applications. It is appreciated that other substrates, such as glass (including silicon on insulator) and ceramic substrates may be suitable. Substrate <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> may have contact points (pads, terminals) disposed on its surface to which device structures (e.g., electrodes) may be formed. Conductive traces may also be disposed throughout the body of substrate <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> to connect contact points on the substrate to one another or to another substrate. Substrate <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> may further have one or more device levels, including interconnect levels, formed thereon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, micro-bridge resonator structure <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is formed by a series of deposition and etch patterning. Micro-bridge resonator structure <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> includes, for example, a polycrystalline silicon bridge shown, in this view, to comprise support structures <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight> overlying anchor portions <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and beam <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> disposed above electrode <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. Beam <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is, in one sense, supported between support structure <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight> but is otherwise free-standing. In this embodiment, z-direction thickness of anchor portions <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> of, for example, silicon dioxide (SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>), separate beam <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> from substrate <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. Electrode <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> is illustrated adjacent beam <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> It is appreciated that, once formed, micro-bridge resonator structure <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> will have a certain resonating frequency that primarily owing to the limitations of the processing environment, may or may not be the targeted frequency for the particular application (e.g., filter, oscillator, etc.). Thus, in certain instances, it is desirable to modify the resonating frequency of micro-bridge resonator structure <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. In general, the resonance frequency depends on the length and thickness of beam <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. It has also been determined that the resonance frequency may be influenced by the compliance of the supporting structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> show a cross-sectional side view and a top view, respectively, of micro-bridge resonator structure <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> following modification of support structures <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight> to influence (modify) the resonance frequency of the structure. In this example, notches <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> are introduced in support structures <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight>. In one example, notches <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> are formed by lithographic techniques, e.g., patterning a masking material over micro-bridge resonator structure <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and etching notches <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> into support structures <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight>. In terms of etching, any suitable etchant to etch, in this case, polycrystalline silicon and the material for anchor portion <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is suitable. Alternatively, and particularly for reduced feature size device structures where point control is desired, notches <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> may be introduced using a focused ion beam (FIB) or laser etching process. In either case, control of the beam center position can be as good a few nanometers (nm). Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, in this example, notches <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> extend completely through support structures <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight> and anchor portion <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> It has been found that etching a notch in the support structures of a micro-bridge resonator generally increases the compliance of the support structure. An increase in compliance (flexibility) generally decreases the resonance frequency of a resonator structure. Compliance is influenced by the effective pad size of the support structures. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, support structures <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight> have an effective pad size defined by the parameter D (e.g., y-direction length). Prior to introducing notches <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, the pad size is defined by the parameter D<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>. After introducing notches <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, the pad size is defined by the smaller parameter D<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(D<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&lt;D<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>). The determination of pad size is defined by parameter D<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and support structure portion <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight>A while, in this example, support structure portion <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight>B is mechanically irrelevant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows the effect of support pad size on the resonance frequency. The calculation is performed for a resonator beam of 0.25 microns (&mgr;m) thickness and one micron in length by 1 micron in width. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, as support pad size decreases, for example, from D<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, to D<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, the resonance frequency decreases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in the above embodiment, a modification to the support structure of a micro-bridge resonator structure can influence the resonance frequency of the resonator. Thus, in the situation where a MEMS-fabricated resonator does not meet the targeted resonance frequency following processing (e.g., deposition, patterning), the resonance frequency may be modified by modifying the support structures. Thus, a targeted value of resonance frequency is attainable by evaluating the resonance frequency of a resonator and modifying the support structures, where necessary, to achieve a desired resonance frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows a second embodiment of a micro-bridge resonator structure modified to meet a targeted resonance frequency. Micro-bridge resonator structure <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> includes support structures <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> supporting resonator beam <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> over a portion of substrate <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. In this view, notches are introduced in support structures <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> about two different axes. It has been found that introducing (forming) a notch in the z-direction (e.g., orthogonal to the resonator beam length) is generally more sensitive to resonance frequency modification than a notch in the y-direction. Thus, notches <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> may be introduced (formed) in support structures <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> in a z-direction as a &ldquo;coarse&rdquo; correction. Such notches <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> may be formed as described above with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference> and the accompanying text. Notches <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> may be formed through a portion, including the entire portion of support structures <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> with the compliance of beam <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> generally increasing with the depth of the notch. Where notches <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> extend through the entire portion of support structures <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight>, notches <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> and support structures <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> define support structure portions <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight>B with the pad size defined by parameter D<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>similar to that described above with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference> and the accompanying text. The coarse modification (correction) may be used, for example, to bring the resonance frequency within a few one-hundredths of the targeted frequency. Thus, having formed notches <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight>, the resonance frequency may be evaluated for accuracy with the targeted resonance frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> To further modify the resonance frequency in a generally minor fashion (e.g., &ldquo;fine&rdquo; tuning) additional notches may be introduced in support structures <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> in a different direction, such as in this case, the y-direction. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, notches <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight>B are formed in a y-direction in support structures <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight>. In this illustration, two notches <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight>B are formed in each support structures. It is appreciated that the number and location of notches will vary depending on the level of tuning. For example, a single y-direction (or other direction) notch may be introduced in each support structures <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> and this can be followed by an evaluation of the frequency of resonator structure <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. If further tuning is necessary, additional (one or more) y-direction (or other direction) notches may be introduced as necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows a third embodiment of a micro-bridge resonator structure modified to meet a targeted resonance frequency. Micro-bridge resonator structure <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> includes support structure <highlight><bold>435</bold></highlight> supporting resonator beam <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> over a portion of substrate <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. In this view, notches <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight> are introduced in support structures <highlight><bold>435</bold></highlight> in a z-direction through less than the entire portion of the support structure. As noted above, it is appreciated that notches may be formed (for example, by ion beam or laser cutting technique) through a portion, including the entire portion, of support structures <highlight><bold>435</bold></highlight> with the compliance of beam <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> generally increasing with the depth of the notch. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, notches <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight> are introduced into support structures <highlight><bold>435</bold></highlight> to a depth, H. The notches <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight> modify the pad size of support structures <highlight><bold>435</bold></highlight> by forming portions <highlight><bold>435</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>435</bold></highlight>B. It is appreciated that, where the notches do not proceed through the entire portion of support structures <highlight><bold>435</bold></highlight>, support structure portion <highlight><bold>435</bold></highlight>B remains mechanically relevant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows a fourth embodiment of a micro-bridge resonator structure modified to meet a targeted resonance frequency. In this example, structural material is added to the support structures to, for example, increase the target resonance frequency. Micro-bridge resonator structure <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> includes support structures <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight> supporting resonator beam <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> over a portion of substrate <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>. It has been found that it is possible to modify the frequency of vibration by adding material to support structures <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight>. For example, where it is found that the resonance frequency of an on-chip resonator is too low, the resonance frequency may be increased by adding material <highlight><bold>555</bold></highlight> to support structures <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight>. It is believed the addition of material <highlight><bold>555</bold></highlight> to support structures <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight> stiffens micro-bridge resonator structure <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> thereby increasing the resonance frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, material <highlight><bold>555</bold></highlight> is introduced over support structures <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight>. Suitable material includes but is not limited to materials having a generally high modulus of elasticity. Materials having a modulus of elasticity of 100 giga-Pascals (gPa) and preferably greater than 100 gPa are particularly suitable. Such materials include, but are not limited to, silicon nitride (SiN) or tungsten (W). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In the illustration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9, a</cross-reference> free-standing structure is shown for over substrate <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>. In general, a conventional deposition such as a chemical vapor deposition cannot be used to introduce material <highlight><bold>555</bold></highlight> over support structure <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight> due to the possibility that the deposition will hinder or modify the free-standing structure to a non-free-standing form.
