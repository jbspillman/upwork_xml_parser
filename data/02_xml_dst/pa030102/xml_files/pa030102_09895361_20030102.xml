<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The increasing power consumption of microprocessors and other integrated circuits (ICs) has become one of the major issues for current and next generation designs. Power-related costs (e.g. cooling and power delivery) can have a significant impact on the overall cost of an integrated circuit chip and, therefore, cut into profit margins in an increasingly competitive marketplace. Additionally, high power consumption and junction temperatures can limit the performance of high-end microprocessors and other ICs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> More particularly, register files and other memory can consume a significant percentage of power on a microprocessor, for example. For current and next generation microprocessors, the size and number of memory structures on a microprocessor continues to increase such that the percentage of overall power dissipation attributable to these structures is also expected to rise.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A method and apparatus for low power memory bit line precharging is described. In the following description, particular types of integrated circuits and circuit configurations are described for purposes of illustration. It will be appreciated, however, that other embodiments are applicable to other types of integrated circuits, and to circuits configured in another manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> For one embodiment, a memory bit line coupled to a memory is coupled to a first read precharge device. A second write precharge device is also coupled to the memory bit line and is enabled only in response to a memory write operation. Further details of this and other embodiments are provided in the description that follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> For purposes of example, embodiments of the invention are described below in reference to an exemplary memory on a microprocessor. It will be appreciated, however, that other embodiments may be applicable to a different type of memory that is organized in a different manner and/or to a memory provided on a different type of processor or other type of integrated circuit chip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a block diagram of a processor <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in which the memory bit line precharging approach of one embodiment (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> below) may be advantageously used. The processor <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may include, for example, one or more memories <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> such as one or more cache memory(ies), one or more register file(s), etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that the processor <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes other functional blocks and/or other types of circuitry that are not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a schematic and block diagram of a prior memory <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> that may currently be used to provide one or more of the memories <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The memory <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> includes a memory array <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>, write data drivers and column multiplexer (mux) circuitry <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, read column mux and sense amplifier (sense amp) circuitry <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> and write column select drivers <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. The memory <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> also includes true and complementary (differential) bit lines BIT&lt;0&gt;. . . BIT&lt;N&gt; and BIT&num;&lt;0&gt;. . . BIT&num;&lt;N&gt;, respectively, coupled to memory elements (not shown) in the memory array <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>, precharge devices <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> coupled to precharge the bit lines, equalization devices <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> to equalize the differential bit lines during a precharge operation and clock delay circuitry <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight> to provide a precharge clock signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Although only two sets of complementary bit lines are shown, the memory <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may include any number of pairs of bit lines. Further, it will be appreciated that the memory <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may include other circuitry not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In operation, where a memory write operation is directed to one or more memory cells in the memory array <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>, write enable and column select signals are received at the write column select drivers <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. In response, the write column select drivers <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> control the write data drivers and column multiplexer circuitry <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> to drive the bit lines corresponding to the memory cell(s) to be written according to the data to be written. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> If, for example, a logical one value is to be written to a memory cell located in a column of the memory array that is coupled to the bit lines BIT&lt;0&gt; and BIT&num;&lt;0&gt;, the write data drivers and column mux circuitry <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> cause the bit line BIT&lt;0&gt; to be pulled high and the bit line BIT&num;&lt;0&gt; to be pulled low for one exemplary memory. Word line (row) select circuitry (not shown) is also included to select the desired memory cell in the column to be written. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Typically, for a memory write operation, the complementary bit lines for the selected column are pulled rail-to-rail (or close to rail-to-rail) to ensure that the desired data is written to the memory cell. In other words, if BIT&num;&lt;0&gt; is to be pulled low as in the above example, it is pulled to ground while BIT&lt;0&gt; is held at the supply voltage of the memory <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Where a memory read operation is instead directed to the memory array <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>, select signals (not shown) are received by the read column mux and sense amp circuitry <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> to cause the bit lines coupled to a memory cell to be read to be discharged according to the value stored in the memory cell. The corresponding sense amp(s) then sense the bit lines to determine the value stored in the memory cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In contrast to a memory write operation, for a memory read operation, the value stored in a memory cell can be detected by the sense amps <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> after only partially discharging the appropriate bit line(s). For example, for one memory, the value stored in a memory cell may be determined after discharging one of the bit lines by only 200-300 mV. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Following a memory access operation of any type, in preparation for the next memory access operation, the bit lines BIT&lt;0&gt;. . . BIT&lt;N&gt; and BIT&num;&lt;0&gt;. . . BIT&num;&lt;N&gt; are precharged and complementary pairs of bit lines are equalized. Precharge and equalization of the bit lines is performed by the precharge <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> and equalization devices <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, respectively, in response to a precharge clock signal (precharge clk) from delay circuitry <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight> transitioning low. For this example, the bit lines are precharged high, but for another example, the bit lines may alternatively be precharged low. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Because a memory write operation may cause a bit line to be pulled all the way to ground, the precharge and equalization devices must be sized to be large enough to ensure that the bit lines can be pulled from ground to the supply voltage level during the time that the precharge clk signal is low (referred to herein as the precharge period). For high frequency operation, the precharge clock signal may be low for a very short amount of time such that the precharge devices must be relatively large to provide the desired pull-up strength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> This worst case sizing for precharging following a write operation is used even though, for many memory implementations, read operations, which cause the bit lines to be only partially discharged, are more frequent than write operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> To address this issue, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a block and schematic diagram of a memory <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> of one embodiment that may be used to provide one or more of the memories <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> or a memory on a different type of integrated circuit device. Like the memory <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the memory <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> includes a memory array <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>, write data drivers and column mux circuitry <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, read column mux and sense amp circuitry <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>, write column select drivers <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and a delay circuit <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> to provide a precharge clock signal. Unlike the memory <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, however, the memory <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> includes separate write precharge <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> and equalization devices <highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight> and read precharge <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> and equalization devices <highlight><bold>355</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In operation, for a memory write operation directed to the memory array <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>, column select and write enable signals are received at the write column select drivers <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. In response, the write column select drivers <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> control the write data drivers and column multiplexer circuitry <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> to drive the bit lines corresponding to the memory cell(s) to be written according to the data to be written as described above in reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Writing of the selected memory cell(s) occurs in response to the clock signal CLK going high for this exemplary embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Concurrently with the arrival of the write enable signal at the write column select drivers <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, the write enable signal is received by a latch <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight>. When the clock signal CLK transitions high, the write enable signal is latched. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Precharging and equalization of the bit lines following a write operation is performed in a different manner than for the memory <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. After the clock signal CLK transitions low at an input to read clock delay circuitry <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight>, four inversions later, the precharge CLK signal transitions low to enable read precharge and equalization devices <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>355</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Concurrently, in response to the clock signal CLK transitioning low, an output of a NOR gate <highlight><bold>365</bold></highlight> transitions high (due to the high value of the write enable signal latched by the latch <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight>). In this manner, four inversions after the clock signal CLK transitions low, a write precharge clock signal at an output of write clock delay circuitry <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> also transitions low. The low value of the write precharge clock signal causes write precharge and equalization devices <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight>, respectively, to be enabled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Thus, following a write operation directed to the memory array <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>, the read and write precharge devices <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> and the read and write equalization devices <highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>355</bold></highlight> are all enabled to precharge and equalize the bit lines BIT&lt;0&gt;. . . BIT&lt;N&gt; and BIT&num;&lt;0&gt;. . . BIT&num;&lt;N&gt;. For one embodiment, as discussed above, for a write operation, bit lines may be pulled rail-to-rail. Therefore, the combined strength of the read and write precharge devices should be such that any bit lines that have been fully discharged can be fully precharged during the time that the precharge clock and write precharge clock signals are low (i.e. during the precharge period). The write equalization devices <highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight> may be sized, for one embodiment, to have a width substantially similar to the width of the write precharge devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Where a memory access operation directed to the memory array <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> is instead a read operation, the write enable signal is not asserted (i.e. for this example, it is low). A transition of the clock signal CLK from low to high causes data from the desired memory cell to be read by allowing corresponding bit line(s) to be discharged. As described above, using the sense amps <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>, it is possible to read the value stored in a memory cell of the memory array <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> after only a small differential has been developed on the corresponding bit lines. This differential voltage for one embodiment may be in the range of 200-300 mV, for example. Therefore, the precharge devices <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> activated following a memory read access only need to be capable of pulling the bit lines up by a relatively small amount. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> For the post-read precharge operation, in response to the clock signal CLK transitioning low, the precharge clock signal at an output of the clock delay circuitry <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> transitions low four inversions later to initiate the precharge period. For some embodiments, a read enable signal (not shown) may be used to gate the precharge clock signal such that it is only provided to the read precharge and equalization devices <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>355</bold></highlight> in response to a read operation and not every clock cycle. The low value of the precharge clock signal causes the read precharge and equalization devices <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>355</bold></highlight> to be enabled to precharge and equalize the bit lines BIT&lt;0&gt;. . . BIT&lt;N&gt; and BIT&num;&lt;0&gt;. . BIT&num;&lt;N&gt;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The write precharge and equalization devices <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight>, however, are not enabled. For a memory read operation, the write enable signal is low. This low value is latched by the latch <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> in response to the clock signal CLK transitioning high. Therefore, when the clock signal CLK transitions low to initiate the precharge operation, the write precharge clock signal remains high. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The precharge period ends in this example, two inversions after the clock signal CLK transitions high. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In the above-described manner, following a read operation during which one or more of the bit lines is only partially discharged, read precharge and equalization devices <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>355</bold></highlight> alone can be used to precharge and equalize the bit lines BIT&lt;0&gt;. . . BIT&lt;N&gt; and BIT&num;&lt;0&gt;. . . BIT&num;&lt;N&gt;. Further, the read precharge devices <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> may be sized to provide only the drive (i.e. pull-up, in this example) strength needed to precharge the bit lines during the precharge period from a partially discharged state resulting from a read access. As mentioned above, for some exemplary memories, bit lines may only transition <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>mV from their precharged level during a memory read operation. Thus, the read precharge devices <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> may be relatively small. For one embodiment, the read equalization devices <highlight><bold>355</bold></highlight> are sized to have a width that is substantially similar to the width of the read precharge devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> For purposes of illustration, it is assumed, for example, that, in order to provide for worst case precharging and equalization of the bit lines BIT&lt;0&gt;. . . BIT&lt;N&gt; for the memory <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, i</cross-reference>.e. for precharging and equalization following a memory write operation, the precharge and equalization devices <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> are each sized to be <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> microns wide. Thus, per bit of the memory array <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>, there is <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> microns of switched load on the precharge clock during precharge and equalization following either a read or write operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In contrast, for the memory of one embodiment as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, as described above, the read precharge and equalization devices <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>355</bold></highlight> can be significantly smaller than the precharge and equalization devices <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> of the memory <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. This is because a worst case bit line transition during a memory read operation may be much smaller than a worst case bit line transition during a memory write operation. For the example provided above where the worst case voltage swing during a read operation is about 300 mV, where the precharge and equalization devices <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> of the memory <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> are <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> microns wide, the read precharge and equalization devices <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>355</bold></highlight> may only need to be 3 microns wide, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Thus, following a memory read operation, per bit, there is only <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> microns of switched load on the precharge clock during a precharge operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> For a precharge operaton following a memory write operation, it is the combination of the read precharge and equalization devices <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>355</bold></highlight> with the write precharge and equalization devices <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight> that provides the necessary pull-up strength for a worst case bit line transition. For the above example, where the read precharge and equalization devices are <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> microns wide, assuming the pull-up strength needed is the same as for the memory <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and other variables such as process, supply voltage, etc. are equivalent, the write precharge and equalization devices may be sized to be only 7 microns (&mgr;m) wide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> By using smaller read precharge and equalization devices, significant power savings for precharge operations following a memory read access may be realized with little area impact. For the above example, for instance, assuming 80% of memory accesses are read operations and 20% are write operations, a <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>% reduction in precharge clock power may be realized. This is determined by calculating the switched load (width of the transistor for this example) per bit for the memory <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and comparing it with the switched load per bit for the memory <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The switched load per bit for the memory <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> for the example given is: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> (1) 10 &mgr;m/transistor*3 transistors/bit&equals;30 &mgr;m/bit of switched load on the precharge clock </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The switched load per bit for the memory <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> for the given example is: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> (2) 3 &mgr;/transistor*3 transistors/bit&equals;9 &mgr;m/bit (for read) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> (3) (3&plus;7)/&mgr;m/transistor*3 transistors/bit&equals;30 &mgr;m/bit (for write) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Thus, the reduction in precharge clock power for a given exemplary ratio of read to write operations of 80%/20% is: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> (4) (9 &mgr;m/bit/read*80% reads)&plus;(30 &mgr;m/bit/write*20% writes)&equals;13.2 &mgr;m/bit </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> (5) (30 &mgr;m/bit&minus;13.2 &mgr;m/bit)/30 &mgr;m/bit&equals;56% reduction in precharge clock power </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In the above equations, for equation (3), it will be appreciated that the &ldquo;transistor&rdquo; term refers to the combination of read and write precharge and equalization transistors used to precharge and equalize a particular pair of bit lines. Further, for equation (5), the reduction in precharge clock power is the overall reduction in precharge clock power seen by the combination of the precharge clock circuitry <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> and the write precharge clock circuitry <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The above example is provided for illustrative purposes only. For other embodiments, different transistor sizes and relative transistor sizes may be used. Further, it will be appreciated that the power savings for other embodiments as compared to a memory for which the same precharge and equalization devices are used for both read and write operations may also differ. This difference may be based on, for example, different relative transistor sizes and/or a different ratio of read to write operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> For the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, due to the reduced precharge clock load, it may also be possible to reduce the sizes of the devices comprising the clock delay circuitry <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> as compared to the clock delay circuitry <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight> for the memory <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. For instance, the devices of the clock delay circuitry <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight> for the example provided above are sized to drive a 30 &mgr;m/bit load during precharge and equalization. For the memory <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, however, for the exemplary device sizes discussed above, the clock delay circuitry <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> may be sized to drive a 9 &mgr;m/bit load while the clock delay circuitry <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> may be sized to drive a 21 &mgr;m/bit load. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Using the above-described approach, the precharge circuit clock load may be significantly reduced for some embodiments. The reduction in precharge clock load results in a reduction in total memory power dissipation. Further, this may be accomplished without a significant increase in memory area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a flow diagram showing the method of one embodiment for low power bit line precharging. At block <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>, a first read precharge device is enabled to precharge a memory bit line during a precharge period. At block <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, a second write precharge device is enabled to precharge the memory bit line in conjunction with the first read precharge device only if the precharge period immediately follows a memory write operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that, for some embodiments, the actions of blocks <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> may occur concurrently. Further, it will be appreciated that the method of other embodiments may include additional actions not shown or described in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Thus, a low power memory bit line precharge approach is described. In the foregoing specification, the invention has been described with reference to specific exemplary embodiments thereof. It will, however, be appreciated that various modifications and changes may be made thereto without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. For example, for some memories, the bit lines may be precharged low instead of being precharged high. For such embodiments, appropriate complementary logic is also provided. The specification and drawings are, accordingly, to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense. </paragraph>
