<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to the field of communications, and more specifically, to communications in a cellular communication system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Background </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In code division multiple access (CDMA) communication systems, a number of users in the same geographical area may choose to operate on a common carrier frequency. The signal from each user is encoded according to a unique assigned code. A receiver may receive signals from different users with a common carrier frequency. While a signal for one user is being decoded, the signals transmitted from all other users may be treated as interference. A receiver decodes each signal according to the assigned code. Moreover, excessive transmission by a user may cause interference for other users in addition to causing system overload at a base station. In a CDMA system, the power level of the signals transmitted by different users of the system is controlled to control the interference level. The power level of each signal is controlled at the transmitter to maintain an adequate quality of reception at a receiving end. Other reasons, such as conserving battery power, for controlling power level of signals in a CDMA system are well known by one of ordinary skill in the relevant art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Although the power level of the transmitted signal from each user is controlled to maximize the use of the available channels, there is a need for an increased mobility and higher quality of communication services. Such communication services may include wireless radio transmission of digitized speech, still or moving images, text messages and other types of data. The communication channel between a mobile station and a base station may be over two or more related communication channels. One of the channels may be a fundamental channel, and another may be a supplemental channel. The fundamental channel may serve as the primary channel for all the traffic communications between the transmitter and the receiver. The supplemental channel may carry additional data. The supplemental channel may be bursty. The gain level of each channel may be based on the received quality level at the receiver. However, the bursty nature of the supplemental channel may create an inefficient power control scheme in the communication system. The power level may be based on the gain level of each communication channel through a power control scheme in the communication system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> To this end as well as others, there is a need for an efficient gain control of the supplemental channel in a communication system. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In a code division multiple access communication system, a method and an accompanying apparatus provide for controlling gain of a forward supplemental channel by determining gain level of an associated forward fundamental channel (Gfch), determining an adaptive margin (Ma) for the forward supplemental channel and determining a forward supplemental channel gain (Gsch) based on the Gfch and the Ma. The forward supplemental channel is transmitted to the mobile station at the determined Gsch level. A data rate factor based on a data rate of the forward fundamental channel and a data rate of the forward supplemental channel may be determined. The Gsch may be based additionally on the data rate factor. The Gsch may be successively decreased for subsequent data frames targeted for the common mobile station on the forward supplemental channel by successively decreasing the Ma. The Gsch may be increased for a subsequent data frame targeted for the same common mobile station on the forward supplemental channel by increasing the Ma after receiving a supplemental channel frame erasure indicator from the common mobile station.</paragraph>

The data, instructions, commands, information, signals, symbols, and chips that may be referenced throughout the application are advantageously represented by voltages, currents, electromagnetic waves, magnetic fields or particles, optical fields or particles, or a combination thereof. In addition, the blocks shown in each block diagram may represent hardware or method steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates a general block diagram of a communication system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> capable of operating in accordance with any of the code division multiple access (CDMA) communication system standards while incorporating various aspects of the invention. Generally, communication system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a base station <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> that provides communication links between a number of mobile stations, such as mobile stations <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and between the mobile stations <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and a wireline network <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. Base station <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> may include a number of components, such as a mobile station controller, a base station controller and a radio frequency transceiver. For simplicity, such components are not shown. Base station <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> may also be in communication with other base stations (not shown.) Base station <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> communicates with each mobile station <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> via a forward link. The forward link may be maintained by a forward link signal transmitted from base station <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. The forward link signals targeted for mobile stations <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may be summed to form a forward link signal <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Each of the mobile stations <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> receiving forward link signal <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> decodes the forward link signal <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to extract the information that is targeted for its user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Mobile stations <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> communicate with base station <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> via corresponding reverse links. Each reverse link is maintained by a reverse link signal, such as reverse link signals <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> for respectively mobile stations <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Base station <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> may also transmit a predefined series of data bits on a pilot channel via the forward link to all mobile stations to assist each mobile station in decoding the forward link signal <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Each of the mobile stations <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may transmit a pilot channel to base station <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. The pilot channel transmitted from a mobile station may be used for decoding the information carried by the reverse link signal transmitted from the same mobile station. The use and operation of a pilot channel are well known. A transmitter and a receiver for communicating via the forward and reverse links are included in each mobile station <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and base station <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates a block diagram of a receiver <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> used for processing CDMA signals. Receiver <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> demodulates the received signal to extract the information carried by the received signal. Receive (Rx) samples may be stored in RAM <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. Receive samples are generated by a radio frequency/intermediate frequency (RF/IF) system <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> and an antenna system <highlight><bold>292</bold></highlight>. Antenna system <highlight><bold>292</bold></highlight> receives an RF signal and passes the RF signal to RF/IF system <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight>. RF/IF system <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> may be any conventional RF/IF receiver. The received RF signals are filtered, down-converted and digitized to form RX samples at baseband frequencies. The samples are supplied to a demultiplexer (demux) <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. The output of demux <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is supplied to a searcher unit <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and finger elements <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. A control unit <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is coupled thereto. A combiner <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> couples a decoder <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> to finger elements <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. Control unit <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> may be a microprocessor controlled by software and may be located on the same integrated circuit or on a separate integrated circuit. Decoder <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> may include an equalizer (not shown). The decoding function may be combined with the function of the equalizer in decoder <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. The decoding function in decoder <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> may be in accordance with soft-output Viterbi algorithm concatenated, with or without feedback, with functions of an equalizer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> During operation, receive samples are supplied to demux <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. Demux <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> supplies the samples to searcher unit <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and finger elements <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. Control unit <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> configures finger elements <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> to perform demodulation of the received signal at different time offsets based on search results from searcher unit <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. The results of the demodulation are combined and passed to decoder <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. Decoder <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> decodes the data and outputs the decoded data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In general for searching, searcher <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> may use non-coherent demodulation of a pilot channel to test timing hypotheses and phase offsets corresponding to various transmitting sources and multi-paths. The demodulation performed by finger elements <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> may be performed via coherent demodulation of other channels such as control and traffic channels. The information extracted by searcher <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> by demodulating a pilot channel may be used in finger elements <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> for demodulation of other channels. The searcher <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and finger elements <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> may provide both pilot channel searching and demodulation of control and traffic channels. The demodulation and searching can be performed at various time offsets. The results of the demodulation may be combined in combiner <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> before decoding the data transmitted on each channel. Despreading of the channels is performed by multiplying the received samples with the complex conjugate of the PN sequence and assigned Walsh function at a single timing hypothesis and digitally filtering the resulting samples, often with an integrate and dump accumulator circuit (not shown). Such a technique is commonly known in the art. Receiver <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may be used in base station <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and mobile stations <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> for decoding the information on respectively reverse and forward links signals. Base station <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> may employ several of receivers <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to decode the information transmitted from several mobile stations at the same time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Receiver <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may also perform interference cancellation through a correlation process. The received samples, after being read from RAM <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, are passed through a correlation process for each received signal. The correlation process may collectively be described as the operations of searcher <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, finger element <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and combiner <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. Since the received samples contain samples from the signals transmitted from more than one transmitting source, the correlation process may be repeated for each received signal. The correlation process for each received signal may be unique because each signal may require a different correlation parameters as of those found in operations of searcher <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, finger element <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and combiner <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. Each signal may include a traffic channel and a pilot channel. The PN sequence assigned to the traffic channel and pilot channel carried by each signal may be different. The correlation process may include channel estimation, which includes estimating the channel fading characteristics based on the result of correlating with the pilot channel. The channel estimation information is used for correlating with the traffic channel. Each traffic channel is then decoded. The decoding operation of a traffic channel may be combined with the operation of an equalizer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The result from each correlation process may pass through a decoding process in decoder <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. If the transmitted channel is encoded via a convolutional encoding process, the decoding process in decoder <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> is performed according to the utilized convolutional code. If the transmitted channel is encoded via a turbo encoding process, the decoding process in decoder <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> is performed according to the utilized turbo code. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Each signal may be decoded to provide enough information about whether a pass indicator is produced for each cyclic redundancy check (CRC) associated with each transmitted frame of data. Operation and use of CRC in a communication system are well known. If the CRC is passed, the decoded result of the channel associated with the passed CRC may be passed on for further receiving operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The signals received by base station <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> may be input to receiver <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Antenna system <highlight><bold>292</bold></highlight> and RF/IF system <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> receive the signals from the mobile stations <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to produce the samples of the received signals. The received samples may be stored in RAM <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. Receiver <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may incorporate a number of searchers <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, a number of finger elements <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, a number of combiner <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> and a number of decoder <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> for simultaneously performing the correlation process and the decoding process for all the signals received from different mobile stations. However, only one antenna system <highlight><bold>292</bold></highlight> and RF/IF system <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> may be necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Each time a correlation process is started, searcher <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and finger element <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> may start anew for determining non-coherent demodulation of a pilot channel to test timing hypotheses and phase offsets. Searcher <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, or finger element <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, or searcher <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and finger element <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> in combination, may determine the signal to interference ratio (S/I) for each received signal. The ratio Eb/I may be synonymous with the ratio S/I. The ratio Eb/I is a measure of signal energy over interference per unit of a data symbol or data bit. Therefore, S/I and Eb/I may be interchangeable in some respects. The interference may typically be defined as the power spectral density of interference and the thermal noise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> To control interference and maintain an adequate system capacity while allowing adequate reception at a receiving end, the system controls the gain level of each transmitted channel from each transmitting source, or the data rate of each transmitted channel or both. The gain level may be determined through a power control scheme in the communication system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Various power control schemes for controlling power levels of signals in communication system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are known. One or more examples are described in the mobile station-base station Compatibility Standard for Wideband Spread Spectrum Cellular Systems, otherwise known as TIA/EIA-95 and TIA/EIA-2000 standards, incorporated by reference herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The gain level of each channel may be controlled by two independent power control loops, namely an open loop and a closed loop. The open loop power control is based on the need of each mobile station to maintain an adequate communication link with the base station. Therefore, the mobile station closer to the base station needs less power than the mobile station further away. In the open loop power control, the transmitter sets the gain level of the transmitted channel based on independent measurements of S/I of at least one received channel, such as pilot, paging, sync and traffic channels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates various steps of a flow diagram <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> of an exemplary closed loop power control. Operation of closed loop power control method <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> begins once a mobile station in communication system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> seizes a forward link traffic channel. After the initial access attempt by the mobile station, the mobile station sets an initial reverse channel gain level. The initial gain level setting on the reverse link is then adjusted during subsequent communications. The closed loop power control <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> provide the correction to the open loop power control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> To control the gain level of a reverse link channel from a mobile station, base station <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> at step <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> measures the signal to interference ratio (S/I) of the reverse link channel transmitted from the mobile station. The measured S/I is compared with a set point S/I at step <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. The measured S/I may be in the form of Eb/I which is a ratio of bit energy over interference. The set point may be in the same form. The set point is selected for the mobile station. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The set point may be initially based on the open loop power setting by the mobile station. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> If the measured S/I is higher than the set point, at step <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>, base station <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> orders the mobile station to lower the gain level of the reverse link channel by an amount, for example 1 dB. When the measured S/I is higher than the set point, it indicates that the mobile station is transmitting on the reverse link channel at again level higher than is needed to maintain an adequate reverse link communication. As a result, the mobile station is ordered to lower the gain level of its reverse link channel to reduce the overall system interference. If the measured S/I is lower than the set point, at step <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, base station <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> orders the mobile station to increase the gain level of the reverse link channel by an amount, for example 1 dB. When the measured S/I is lower than the set point, it indicates that the mobile station is transmitting on the reverse link channel at a gain level lower than is needed to maintain an adequate reverse link communication. As a result of increasing the gain level, the mobile station may be able to overcome the interference level and provide an adequate reverse link communication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The operations performed at steps <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> may be referred to as the inner loop power control. The inner-loop power control keeps the reverse link S/I at the base station <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> as close as possible to its target threshold as provided by the set point. The target S/I is based on the set point selected for the mobile station. The power up or power down may be performed several times during a time frame. One time frame may be divided into <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> power control groups. Each power control group consists of several data symbols. The power up or power down command may be transmitted 16 times per frame. If one frame of data has not been received at step <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>, the power control loop <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> continues to measure S/I of the reverse link channel during the next power control group at step <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. The process is repeated at steps <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> until at least one frame of data is received from the mobile station. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> A single set point or target may not be satisfactory for all conditions. Therefore, the set point used at step <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> may also change depending on a desired reverse link channel error rate. If one frame of data has been received at step <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>, a new S/I set point may be calculated at step <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. The new set point becomes the new S/I target for the mobile station. The new set point may be based on a number of factors including the frame error rate. For example, if the frame error rate is above a predetermined level, indicating unacceptable frame error rate, the set point may be raised to a higher level. By raising the set point to a higher level, the mobile station consequently increases the reverse link channel gain level via the comparison at step <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and a power up command at step <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. If the frame error rate is below a predetermined level indicating an acceptable frame error rate, the set point may be lowered to a lower level. By lowering the set point to a lower level, the mobile station consequently decreases the reverse link channel gain level via the comparison at step <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and a power down command at step <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>. The operations performed at steps <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, looping back from step <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> to step <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> to indicate a new set point and looping back to step <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> for measuring the S/I of the new frames may be viewed as the outer loop operation. The outer-loop power control may command once every frame. The closed loop power control may command once every power control group. One frame and one power control group may be, respectively, 20 and 1.25 mSec long. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The communication system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may employ a forward link power control scheme to reduce interference. The mobile stations <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> communicate to base station <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> periodically about the voice and data quality. The frame error rate and quality measurements are reported to base station <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> via a power measurement report message. The message contains the number of frames received in error on the forward link channel during an interval. The gain level of the forward link channel is adjusted based on the number of frame errors. For fast response, a reverse link erasure bit may be used to inform base station <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> whether the previous frame was received with or without error. The channel power gain may be continuously adjusted while monitoring the message or the erasure bit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> forward link channel structure <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> depicts the structure of code channels that may be transmitted by base station <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. Forward link channel structure <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> includes a forward channel <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. Forward channel <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> may include a forward traffic channel <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> and a forward pilot channel <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>. Forward traffic channel <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> includes at least a forward fundamental channel <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight>. Each forward fundamental channel <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight> may have an associated forward supplemental channel <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight>. The resources used for transmission of forward supplemental channel <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> may be shared among mobile stations <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. As such, forward supplemental channels <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> may be referred to as the forward shared supplemental channel <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight>. The gain levels of forward fundamental channel <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight> and the associated supplemental channel <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> may be controlled in accordance with various embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> reverse link channel structure <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> depicts the structure of reverse link code channels that may be transmitted by mobile stations <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Reverse link channel structure <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> includes a reverse link channel <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>. Reverse link channel <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, among several channels, includes a reverse traffic channel <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> for radio configurations three through six. Various radio configurations have been described in the relevant standards incorporated by reference herein. Generally, the communications between base station <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and mobile stations <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may be limited to a set of predefined data rates and modulation schemes in each radio configuration. Reverse traffic channel <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight>, among several channels, includes a reverse pilot channel <highlight><bold>541</bold></highlight>, a reverse fundamental channel <highlight><bold>542</bold></highlight> and a reverse power control sub-channel <highlight><bold>543</bold></highlight>. The reverse pilot channel <highlight><bold>541</bold></highlight> and reverse power control sub-channel <highlight><bold>543</bold></highlight> are multiplexed together in each power control group in a frame of data. The data communicated via reverse power control subchannel <highlight><bold>543</bold></highlight> may be used to control gain levels of forward fundamental channel <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight> and the associated supplemental channel <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> in accordance with various embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6, a</cross-reference> frame of data <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> depicts multiplexing of the pilot data of reverse pilot channel <highlight><bold>541</bold></highlight> and power control data of reverse power control sub-channel <highlight><bold>543</bold></highlight>. Each frame may contain <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> power control groups. A power control group <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> depicts multiplexing of the pilot data of reverse pilot channel <highlight><bold>541</bold></highlight> and power control data of reverse power control subchannel <highlight><bold>543</bold></highlight> in each power control group. Each power control group <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> is used to transmit data of reverse pilot channel <highlight><bold>541</bold></highlight> and reverse power control sub-channel <highlight><bold>543</bold></highlight>. The reverse power control sub-channel <highlight><bold>543</bold></highlight> applies to radio configurations three through six. Each mobile station supports the inner and outer power control loops for the forward traffic channel <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight>. The outer power control loop estimates the set-point value based on Eb/Nt to achieve the target frame error rate on each assigned forward traffic channel <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight>. The inner power control loop compares the Eb/Nt of the received forward traffic channel with the corresponding outer power control loop set-point to determine the value of the power control bits to be sent to base station <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> on reverse power control sub-channel <highlight><bold>543</bold></highlight>. The reverse power control subchannel <highlight><bold>543</bold></highlight> may be used by each mobile station <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to transmit to base station <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> an erasure indicator bit (EIB) or a quality indicator bit (QIB). The value of EIB or QIB from a particular mobile station determines for base station <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> whether to increase or decrease the power level on forward traffic channel <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> targeted for that particular mobile station, or re-transmission of the data on a subsequent data frame or both. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The communication system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may employ several modes of a forward power control scheme. The forward traffic channel <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> includes forward fundamental channel <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight> and forward supplemental channel <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight>. The forward fundamental channel <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight>, for the forward power control, may be considered as the primary channel and the supplemental channel <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> as the secondary channel. One frame of data may be for 20 mSec. Each frame of data may include 16 power control groups. Therefore, if the sixteen power control groups are used for controlling gain level of a forward channel, the feedback rate is at 800 bps. If the gain levels of two forward channels, such as forward fundamental channel <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight> and forward supplemental channel <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight>, are being controlled, the feedback rate is less than 800 bps. To control gain level of the primary and the secondary channels at different feedback rates, different modes of the forward power control may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7, a</cross-reference> table <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> provides various forward power control modes in accordance with various embodiments. For example, for the mode &ldquo;<highlight><bold>000</bold></highlight>&rdquo;, all sixteen power control groups are used for power control of the primary channel, such as fundamental channel <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight>. In another example, in mode &ldquo;<highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>&rdquo;, the even numbered power control groups are used to communicate power control bits relating to the primary channel, such as fundamental channel <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight>. The odd numbered power control groups are used to communicate QIB or EIB associated with a secondary channel, such as the supplemental channel <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight>. A forward fundamental channel <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight> from base station <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to a mobile station may have one or two associated forward supplemental channels, such as forward supplemental channel <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight>. The associated forward supplemental channel <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> is used to communicate data to the mobile station in addition to the data being communicated on forward fundamental channel <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight>. The resources used for communications of the supplemental channel <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> may be shared among several forward fundamental channels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8, a</cross-reference> block diagram of a transmitter <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> is shown in accordance with various embodiments. Transmitter <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> may be used in base station <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> for transmitting data to mobile stations <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> on forward fundamental channel <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight> and forward supplemental channel <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight>. An input <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> receives data for transmission on forward fundamental channel <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight>. The data may be received from wire-line network <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. The data may be targeted for a mobile station, such as mobile stations <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Each mobile station in a forward link communication with base station <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> may have a forward fundamental channel <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight>. Additional data may be transmitted to the target mobile station on forward supplemental channel <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The data transmitted on forward fundamental channel <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight> may be continuos over several data frames <highlight><bold>899</bold></highlight>. Each data frame may be 20 mSec long in accordance with an embodiment. Data on the forward supplemental channel <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> may be transmitted sporadically on several data frames <highlight><bold>898</bold></highlight> to a target mobile station. Inputs <highlight><bold>850</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>850</bold></highlight>M receive data for transmission on forward supplemental channel <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> for several mobile stations. A supplemental channel scheduler <highlight><bold>860</bold></highlight> selects data at input <highlight><bold>850</bold></highlight> for transmission in data frames <highlight><bold>898</bold></highlight> on the supplemental channel <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight>. In one example, supplemental channel scheduler <highlight><bold>860</bold></highlight> may select from data frames <highlight><bold>898</bold></highlight> the data frames &ldquo;n, n&plus;3, n&plus;4 and n&plus;8&rdquo; for transmission of data on the supplemental channel <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> to mobile station <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The data frames &ldquo;n&plus;1 and n&plus;7&rdquo; may be selected for transmission of data on supplemental channel <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> to mobile station <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. The data frames &ldquo;n&plus;2, n&plus;5 and n&plus;6&rdquo; may be selected for transmission of data on supplemental channel <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> to mobile station <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> On the reverse power control sub-channel <highlight><bold>543</bold></highlight>, the mobile stations <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> transmit an erasure indicator to the base station <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> during each data frame. The erasure indicator indicates erroneous or error-free received data on the forward supplemental channel <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight>. The mobile stations <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> do not have prior information about the scheduling of data on different data frames <highlight><bold>898</bold></highlight>. The mobile stations <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> attempt to decode data on the supplemental channel <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> during every data frame. If the data received on the supplemental channel <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> is received in error or targeted for another mobile station, an erasure indicator indicating erroneous reception is transmitted to the base station <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> on reverse power control sub-channel <highlight><bold>543</bold></highlight>. Base station <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> may ignore the erasure indicators from the mobile stations that are not selected for transmission on the supplemental channel <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight>. For example, base station <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> expects to receive, during data frame &ldquo;n&rdquo; with appropriate round trip delay time, an erasure indicator indicating erroneous or error-free reception of the transmitted data on the reverse power control sub-channel <highlight><bold>543</bold></highlight> from mobile station <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in response to transmitting the data on supplemental channel <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> during data frame &ldquo;n.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The data on the supplemental channel <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> and fundamental channel <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight> are modulated and encoded in blocks <highlight><bold>861</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>862</bold></highlight> respectively for transmission to a mobile station. The modulation scheme and the encoding steps are described in the specification of at least one of the standards, such as IS-2000 standard, incorporated by reference herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The gain of supplemental channel <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> and gain of fundamental channel <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight> may be selected by a channel gain selector <highlight><bold>890</bold></highlight> in accordance with an embodiment. For example, the gain of forward fundamental channel <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight> may be selected based on the forward link power control scheme used in the communication system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. In case, the reverse power control subchannel <highlight><bold>543</bold></highlight> indicates poor reception of the fundamental channel <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight>, the gain of the fundamental channel <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight> may be increased via the forward link power control loops to improve the Eb/Nt at the target mobile station. In case, the reverse power control sub-channel <highlight><bold>543</bold></highlight> indicates good reception of the fundamental channel <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight>, the gain of the fundamental channel <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight> may be decreased to lower the Eb/Nt at the target mobile station. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The gain level of the supplemental channel <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> may be determined based on the gain level selected for fundamental channel <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight> in accordance with an embodiment. Each data frame of supplemental channel <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> may be associated with a fundamental channel <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight> targeted for a specific mobile station. Therefore, the gain level of supplemental channel <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> may be determined based on the selected gain level of an associated fundamental channel <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight> in accordance with an embodiment. After the gain adjustments in the encoder and modulator blocks <highlight><bold>861</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>862</bold></highlight>, the outputs pass through a carrier modulation block <highlight><bold>863</bold></highlight>. The resulting signal may be amplified before being transmitted from a set of antennas <highlight><bold>864</bold></highlight> to mobile stations <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The signals transmitted between mobile stations <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and base station <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> may propagate through a channel with various fading conditions. An additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel condition approximates a slow fading channel condition for the signal. The forward link power control loop used for controlling gain level of a channel between mobile stations <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and base station <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> may use an Eb/Nt threshold level such that the frame error rate is maintained at an adequate level. The Eb/Nt threshold may be maintained and selected by the forward link power control loop such that the average channel gain is at a level above the AWGN channel level. The average channel gain may be maintained at a level comparable to the AWGN level plus a margin. By allowing the average channel gain to be above the AWGN level, in a fading channel condition, the frame error rate is maintained at an adequate level most of the time. One frame out of many frames may arrive at a poor signal to noise ratio causing a frame error at the receiver. Such a frame error occurs at the deep part of the channel fading condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9, a</cross-reference> graph <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> depicts an example of a channel fading condition <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> and the channel gain <highlight><bold>901</bold></highlight> with respect to time. The gain of the channel is at a peak level when the channel fading condition is at a bottom point. The AWGN of the channel may be at a gain level <highlight><bold>903</bold></highlight>. The average gain of the channel with the power control may be set at an average gain level <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>. The margin between gain level <highlight><bold>903</bold></highlight> and the average gain level <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> allows the communications over the channel to be at an adequate frame error rate under most fading conditions. The communications at the bottom of the fade condition may result in erroneous reception of one or more frames. Such a channel gain model and the associated power control scheme works very well for forward fundamental channel <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight> due to its continuous nature of communication to a mobile station over a period of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The communications over supplemental channel <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> targeted for the same mobile station may be sporadic. The supplemental channel <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> may be shared among several mobile stations <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The channel condition of fundamental channel <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight> at each mobile station may not be the same. The channel condition at one mobile station may be better than others. As such, the communication on the supplemental channel may be based on a priority index for each frame of data. For example, if the priority index of a mobile station is higher than others and the mobile station has a forward supplemental channel <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> with base station <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, the immediately following frame of data on the supplemental channel <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> may be used to transmit data to the mobile station. The supplemental channel scheduler <highlight><bold>860</bold></highlight> may be used to schedule data at input <highlight><bold>850</bold></highlight> corresponding to the mobile station with the highest priority index. In one example, the priority index may be equal to the inverse of the product of the average throughput (T) and the channel gain of the associated forward fundamental channel <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight>. A priority index may be calculated for each mobile station. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The power level of forward fundamental channel <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight> may be based on a periodic feedback from the mobile station. The forward fundamental channel <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight> normally has a continuous communications of data between the receiver and the transmitter. Therefore, the average gain level <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> of forward fundamental channel <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight> may be at a level above an absolute minimum (AWGN) level that accounts for variations in the propagation channel over time. The communications on forward supplemental channel <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> may be sporadic for a mobile station depending on the priority index of the mobile station. As such, the forward supplemental channel <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> and forward fundamental channel <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight> do not experience similar channel conditions in accordance with an embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10, a</cross-reference> graph <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> shows variation of a channel gain of supplemental channel <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> as determined in accordance with various embodiments. The gain of the supplemental channel (Gsch) <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> may be set equal to the gain of the fundamental channel (Gfch) <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight> plus an adaptive margin (Ma). The gain of the supplemental channel (Gsch) <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> may also depend on a data rate factor in accordance with an embodiment. The data rate factor may be based on the data rate of supplemental channel <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> (Rsch) and the data rate of the associated fundamental channel <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight> (Rfch). The adaptive margin Ma may change with every frame of data scheduled for the mobile station in accordance with an embodiment. For example, at an initial time, data frame <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the Gsch may be at a level &ldquo;A&rdquo;. At the data frame <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the next data frame scheduled for transmission on supplemental channel <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> to the same mobile station, the Gsch is dropped by an amount to the level &ldquo;B&rdquo;. At the data frame <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the next data frame scheduled for transmission on supplemental channel <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> to the same mobile station, the Gsch is dropped again by an amount to the level &ldquo;C&rdquo;. At the data frame <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the next data frame scheduled for transmission on the supplemental channel <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> to the same mobile station, the Gsch is dropped again by an amount to the level &ldquo;D&rdquo;. The drop in the supplemental channel gain Gsch may be accomplished by adjusting the adaptive margin Ma before each transmission. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> If a data frame on the supplemental channel <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> is received in error, the Gsch for the next scheduled data frame is increased by an amount sufficiently large that, perhaps, provide adequate reception at the receiver in accordance with an embodiment. In this case, at the data frame <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the next data frame scheduled for transmission on the supplemental channel <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> to the same mobile station, the Gsch is increased by an amount to the level &ldquo;F&rdquo;. The increase of the supplemental channel gain Gsch from the gain level D to the gain level F is sufficiently large that allows error-free communication. The increase in the supplemental channel gain Gsch may be accomplished by adjusting the adaptive margin Ma before each transmission in accordance with an embodiment. If no frame error received after data frame <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the supplemental channel gain Gsch begins to drop successively by an amount after each data frame scheduled for transmission on the supplemental channel <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> to the same mobile station in accordance with an embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> On the reverse power control sub-channel <highlight><bold>543</bold></highlight>, in mode &ldquo;<highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>&rdquo; of the forward power control modes, the even numbered power control groups are used to communicate power control bits relating to the fundamental channel <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight>, and the odd numbered power control groups are used to communicate data frame error via QIB or EIB associated with the supplemental channel <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight>. The adaptive margin Ma is increased when a frame error is received, and decreased when a data frame is received with error as indicated by QIB or EIB on the reverse power control sub-channel <highlight><bold>543</bold></highlight> in accordance with an embodiment. In one example, if the gain of the forward fundamental channel Gfch and the data rate factor remain the same, the behavior of the adaptive margin Ma may be as shown in graph <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the gain of the supplemental channel Gsch is dynamically controlled by determining the adaptive margin Ma before each scheduled data frame transmission to the same mobile station in accordance with an embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11, a</cross-reference> flow chart <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> depicts a method for determining the adaptive margin Ma for a data frame transmitted on supplemental channel <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> targeted for a mobile station in accordance with an embodiment. Various steps of flow chart <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> may be performed by channel gain selector <highlight><bold>890</bold></highlight> in accordance with an embodiment. At a step <highlight><bold>1101</bold></highlight>, the adaptive margin Ma may be initialized for the first data frame on supplemental channel <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> targeted for the mobile station. Such an initialization may be performed before transmitting the first data frame on supplemental channel <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> to the mobile station. At step <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>, one data frame on supplemental channel <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> is transmitted to the mobile station at a gain level Gsch based on at least the adaptive margin Ma. At step <highlight><bold>1103</bold></highlight>, the channel gain selector <highlight><bold>890</bold></highlight> determines whether a previous data frame transmitted on supplemental channel <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> to the same mobile station is received without error. Such information may be communicated to the base station on the reverse power control sub-channel <highlight><bold>543</bold></highlight>. If the data frame is received without error, the adaptive margin Ma is decreased at step <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight> for a subsequent data frame transmitted to the same mobile station. If the data frame is received with error, the adaptive margin Ma is increased at step <highlight><bold>1105</bold></highlight> for a subsequent data frame transmitted to the same mobile station. The amount of increase at step <highlight><bold>1105</bold></highlight> is much larger than the amount of decrease at step <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight> in accordance with an embodiment. The increase at step <highlight><bold>1105</bold></highlight> may be equal to 0.5 dB in comparison to a 0.005 dB decrease at step <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
