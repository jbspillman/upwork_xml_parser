<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to the art of mounting glass or other light transmitting panels in door openings, such mounted panels being known in the art as doorlites. More particularly, the invention relates to a novel doorlite mounting system, the doorlite supporting frames of the system, their manufacture and their packaging. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Again, more particularly, the invention relates to the provision of a novel doorlite mounting system which enables doorlites to be accurately installed in an extremely simple operation including the installation of actual or truly divided doorlites with the resulting installation being decorative and free of any visible fasteners thus enhancing the aesthetics of the door in addition to providing the desired doorlite feature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In this connection, the invention is particularly directed to a mounting system which provides for the quick, simple and accurate mounting of a doorlite including separate light transmitting panels by means of screws whose heads are fully concealed. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In order to support a light transmitting panel, which is usually glass, in an opening provided in a door, a frame arrangement must be provided to support the glass panel and this frame must be made to fit in the door opening and secured in place by framing members secured to opposite sides of the door by screws or other fasteners whose visible presence detracts from the appearance of the doorlite. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> To avoid the additional work and complexity of having separate glass panels for divided doorlites, it is conventional to simply use wood or other struts or bars bridging a simple glass panel to give the appearance of a divided doorlite. Such dividing bars simply add to the work required to provide a finished appearance to the divided doorlites. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to providing a doorlite system which enables doorlites, including truly divided doorlites, to be accurately installed in an extremely simple operation with all securing fasteners fully concealed so that the resulting installation enhances the aesthetics of the door in addition to providing the desired doorlite feature. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The invention involves the provision of an inner frame and an outer frame to be inserted from the inner and outer sides of a door respectively into an opening provided in the door and then screwed together to embrace the door around the perimeter of the door opening and to support the doorlite therebetween within the door opening. To provide for the hiding of the heads of the screws used to secure the frames together, the inner frame has a channel formation therein to house the heads of the screws. A cover member for the channel is then provided to overlie and conceal these screw heads. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> For the divided doorlite, inner and outer muntins are provided for bridging across the door opening these muntins being adapted to be screwed together to support a doorlite glass or panel at opposite sides thereof. Again, to provide for the optimum aesthetics of the doorlite, the inner muntin is provided with a channel therein to house the heads of screws used to secure the muntins together and a cover is provided for the channel to hide the screw heads. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Again, according to another aspect of the invention, the inner and outer frames have interengaging registering formations extending therearound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention involves the novel manufacture and packaging of such frames ready for insertion into openings provided in doors in which the openings have straight sides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In this connection, lengths of material having the profiles of the inner and outer frames and the inner frame screw head cover corresponding to the length of the perimeter of the opening in the door into which the doorlite is to be mounted are extruded and drilled to provide the requisite screw guiding bores. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The frames are then screwed together with the screw heads housed in the channel in the inner frame profile and the cover snapped in place to close the channel. These screwed together inner and outer frame profiles with the channel cover in place are then cut into lengths corresponding to the lengths of the sides of the doorlite opening and at the required angles so that the cut lengths can be assembled into a frame to fit the door opening. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In the case of a rectangular opening in the door, the assembled lengths of screwed together frame profiles and cover member are cut at 45 degree angles at the appropriate points to form the four sides of the ultimate desired frame with each side having 45 degree ends. These sides are then assembled into the rectangular frame and screwed together ready for shipping. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> At the cite of the doorlite installation, the screws holding the inner and outer frames together are temporarily removed, the body of the outer frame is inserted into the door opening from the outer side of the door, the glass placed within the outer and inner frames, and the body of the inner frame inserted into the door opening from the inner side of the door. The frames are then screwed back together and the screw head cover snapped in place to complete the installation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In the case of the divided doorlite, the inner and outer frames will be assembled as set out above with two glass panels located therebetween and held separated by the inner and outer muntins which are bridged across the assembled inner and outer frames. After screwing the muntins together, the muntin screw head housing channel will be closed by the snap cover as in the case of the inner and outer frames. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> It will thus be appreciated that after receiving the packaged assembled doorlite frame unit, the customer need only remove the snap covers, remove the screws, assemble the doorlite, unit in the door opening with the appropriate glass sections, screw the inner and outer frames and muntins together and close the screw head channels with the snap on covers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> These and other features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The profile of each side of the inner frame <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> has a body portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> having an outer wall <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and an inner wall <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which define a channel <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> therebetween having locking ribs <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> at the entrance thereto. The outer wall <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> at its exterior side terminates in an outwardly extending door engaging flange <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The inner wall <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> at the interior side of the body portion ends in an inwardly projecting glazing unit engaging flange <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. A trim wall <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> extends between the exterior end of the inner wall <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to the inner end of the flange <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> At its interior side, the body portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the inner frame has an interiorly projecting nose <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> which is adapted to be snugly received in the socket <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> at the interior end of the body portion <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the outer frame <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> It will be understood that the body portion <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the outer frame <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> will be introduced from the exterior of the door D into a doorlite opening <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> provided in the door as shown in dotted lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The inner frame <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> will then have its body portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> inserted into the doorlite opening <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> from the interior of the door. By providing the socket <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> at the inner side of the outer frame body <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the projecting nose <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> at the inner side of the body portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the inner frame <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the entering of the nose <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> into the socket <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> provides accurate registration of the frames <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> which extends continuous around the perimeters of the frame bodies <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> These two registered frames are then secured together by screws <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> which are introduced into the channel <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> in the inner frame to extend through the nose <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the inner frame and into the body portion <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the outer frame with the heads of the screws, only one of which is shown at <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> housed in the channel <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> It will be understood that the muntin bars <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> will extend across from one side to the other of the frames <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with the lower and upper panels <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> sandwiched between the frames <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> at their sides and at their edges remote from the dividing muntin bar assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to provide a divided doorlite which can be mounted very easily, quickly and securely simply by screwing the frames <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the muntin bars <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> together after which all of the screws whose heads are received in the respective frame and muntin bar channels immediately hidden by snapping on the closure frame <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the muntin bar closure <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The manufacture of the frames <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for straight sided door openings can be carried out very simply by extruding lengths of suitable material such as PVC having the desired inner and outer profiles as shown, for example, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, drilling the bodies <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> with the appropriate screw guide bores on line, then screwing these elongated frame profiles together, then closing the channel <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the inner profile member with an extruded length of material having the closure frame profile as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The assembled profiles are then cut into lengths corresponding to the lengths of the sides of the doorlite opening with the angles of the cuts such that the cut lengths can be assembled to provide the requisite frame configuration. These assembled lengths are then screwed together into complete inner, outer and cover frames ready to be shipped as a package for the particular doorlite opening. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> For the usual rectangular doorlite in which a rectangular opening is provided or cut in the door, the screwed together lengths of frame profile are cut at the appropriate points corresponding to the length of the sides of the doorlite opening at 45 degree angles. These four cut pieces are then screwed together into the inner and outer frames and cover frame as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and shipped in this assembled relation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> At the installation cite, the screws <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are temporarily removed, the outer frame <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> then has its body portion <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> inserted into the doorlite opening from the outer side of the door with the outer frame flange <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> engaging the door around the opening. The glazing unit or panel is then inserted into the outer frame <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to engage the inner flange <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the frame. The inner frame <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> then has its body portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> inserted into the door opening from the inner side of the door so that its flange <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> engages the door around the perimeter of the opening and its glazing unit engaging flange <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> engages the glazing unit. The two frames <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are then again secured together by the screws <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the closure frame <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> snapped into place to conceal the heads of the screws housed within the inner frame channel <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Where the doorlite is to be a divided doorlite, the muntin bars <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> will be employed between the glazing panels as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> It will be understood that various details in the appearances of the profiles of the frames <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be made as desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> It will also be understood that, while the invention is particularly applicable to providing a doorlite system for doorlite openings that have straight sides so that the frame profiles can be extruded, it is applicable to other shapes of doorlite openings where, for instance, the frames can be molded to the appropriate shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Although various preferred embodiments of the present invention have been described herein in detail, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, that variations may be made thereto without departing from the scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
