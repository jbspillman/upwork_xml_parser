<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally regards the coating of work-pieces. More particularly, the present invention regards method and system for precision coating implantable medical appliances. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The positioning and deployment of medical appliances within a target site of a patient is a common, often-repeated procedure of contemporary medicine. These appliances or implants are used for innumerable medical purposes including the reinforcement of recently re-enlarged lumens and the replacement of ruptured vessels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Coatings are often applied to these medical appliances to increase their effectiveness. These coatings may provide a number of benefits including reducing the trauma suffered during the insertion procedure, facilitating the acceptance of the medical appliance into the target site, and improving the post-procedure effectiveness of the appliance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Expandable stents, stent grafts, balloon delivery systems, and aneurism coils are specific examples of medical appliances or implants that may be coated and inserted within the body. Expandable stents are tube-like medical appliances that often have a mesh-like structure designed to support the inner walls of a lumen. These stents are typically positioned within a lumen and, then, expanded to provide internal support for it. Because of the direct contact of the stent with the inner walls of the lumen, stents have been coated with various compounds and therapeutics to enhance their effectiveness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> When this coating is haphazardly applied or has somehow been removed during the stent&apos;s manufacture or delivery, the stent&apos;s effectiveness can be compromised. In certain circumstances, defective implanted stents must be removed and reinserted through a second medical procedure&mdash;an unwanted result. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Indiscriminate coating methods such as dip-coating and spray-coating have been used to coat stents as well as other medical appliances. These methods are, however, both wasteful and difficult to control. For example, dipping can result in non-uniform application of the coating to the appliance, thereby placing more coating at one end or region of the stent and making it difficult to predict the dosage of therapeutic that will be delivered when the stent or other appliance is implanted. The indiscriminate nature of dipping is also problematic as it may lead to the cracking and crumbling of coating at the junctions, hinges, and flexing members of the mesh-like stents. The coating that covers the hinged portions of the stent is highly susceptible to be exfoliated because, as the stent is expanded, intolerable stresses may develop within the coating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> are illustrative of some of the concerns stemming from an indiscriminate coating process like dipping. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> stent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is shown in a closed, pre-deployment state. Here, the stent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has been previously dipped in a vat of therapeutic in the direction of arrow <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In other words, the right side of the stent was the leading edge of the stent entering the dipping vat. As can be seen, the coating of stent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is heavier on the right side of the stent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> than on the left side and covers each of the junctions <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> throughout the entire stent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. As can also be seen, the coating becomes progressively thicker and covers more of the space between each of the struts <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as you travel from the left side of the stent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to the right side of the stent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. This increasing thickness of coating is indicative of a stent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> that has been dipped and let stand on one of its ends as the coating dries and adheres to the stent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows the unevenly coated stent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> in an expanded state as it may be after it is positioned within the body. As is evident, the expansion of stent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has led to the cracking and crumbling of coating <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Also evident is that the coating has been removed from most if not all of the junction points <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> after the stent has been expanded. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> System and method for coating a medical appliance is provided. In accord with on embodiment, a system for applying a coating to a medical appliance having accessible patterned surfaces is provided. This system may include: a processor, a support, and a bubble jet printing head having individual printing nozzles.

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates a system for coating a medical appliance using a bubble jet printer head in accord with one embodiment of the present invention. In this system bubble jet printer head <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> may be used to force coating onto the patterned surfaces of the medical appliance <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment the head <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> may be placed in close proximity to medical appliance <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and may be moved back and forth along track <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> so that it may be able to coat the entire external patterned surface of the medical appliance <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The printer head <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> may be controlled by or at least receive signals from processor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, which instructs it to coat only the struts <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> of the medical appliance <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. In other words, as the bubble jet printer head <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> slides back and forth along track <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and as the medical appliance <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is spun on support <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, the head <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> may force coating onto the struts while concurrently refraining from forcing coating into spaces between the struts <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight>, because coating forced into these spaces would simply be wasted or result in errant deposits of coating elsewhere on the stent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> portion <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> of the struts <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> have already been coated, while other portions of the struts <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> have not. Also apparent in this Figure is that the junctions <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> of struts <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> have not been coated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> the coating source <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> may be in fluid communication with the head <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and may be used to supply coating to the head <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The storage media <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may be in communication with the processor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and may be used to store and provide instructions for the processor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the coating source <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> for coating the medical appliance <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The storage media may be one of numerous types of available storage media including both volatile (i.e. RAM) and non-volatile storage devices (i.e. ROM, CD ROM, EEPROM, Magnetic Media, etc.). The pre-programmed instructions or other retained data may be unique to each medical appliance and may account for the unique external pattern and precise dimensions of each medical device that may be coated by the printer head <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The storage media <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may also hold unique instruction sets for many different medical appliances or may be provided with a media receptacle such as a disk drive that accommodates different recordable media, each recordable media holding a unique instruction set for a single medical appliance or for multiple medical appliances. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, the medical appliance <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> in this embodiment may be rotated by the support <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> in order to expose different sides of the medical appliance <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to the bubble jet printer head <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Consequently, through the coordinated movement of the bubble jet printer head <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> on track <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and the medical appliance <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> in support <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, all external portions of the medical appliance <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may be exposed to and coated by the nozzles (not shown) of the bubble jet printer head <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment, wherein the medical appliance is flat or otherwise linear, the support configuration may be different than that described above. Here, the support may provide for movement of the appliance in both the x and y planes while the printer head moves back an forth overhead in order to reach the entire surface of the medical device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> As described above, bubble jet printer head <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> may be in fluid communication with a coating source <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. This coating source <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> may contain any one of several possible coatings to be placed on the medical appliance <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. These coatings could include paclitaxel, a polymer with a suspended therapeutic, a non-thrombogenic agent, a lubricious material, a non-slippery material, a radiopaque agent, a radioactive agent, and a magnetic signature agent. These coatings could also include: pharmaceutically active compounds, proteins, cells, oligonucleotides, ribozymes, anti-sense oligonucleotides, DNA compacting agents, gene/vector systems (i.e., any vehicle that allows for the uptake and expression of nucleic acids), nucleic acids (including, for example, recombinant nucleic acids; naked DNA, cDNA, RNA; genomic DNA, cDNA or RNA in a non-infectious vector or in a viral vector and which further may have attached peptide targeting sequences; antisense nucleic acid (RNA or DNA); and DNA chimeras which include gene sequences and encoding for ferry proteins such as membrane translocating sequences (&ldquo;MTS&rdquo;) and herpes simplex virus-1 (&ldquo;VP22&rdquo;)), and viral, liposomes and cationic and anionic polymers and neutral polymers that are selected from a number of types depending on the desired application. Non-limiting examples of virus vectors or vectors derived from viral sources include adenoviral vectors, herpes simplex vectors, papilloma vectors, adeno-associated vectors, retroviral vectors, and the like. Non-limiting examples of biologically active solutes include anti-thrombogenic agents such as heparin, heparin derivatives, urokinase, and PPACK (dextrophenylalanine proline arginine chloromethylketone); antioxidants such as probucol and retinoic acid; angiogenic and anti-angiogenic agents and factors; agents blocking smooth muscle cell proliferation such as rapamycin, angiopeptin, and monoclonal antibodies capable of blocking smooth muscle cell proliferation; anti-inflammatory agents such as dexamethasone, prednisolone, corticosterone, budesonide, estrogen, sulfasalazine, acetyl salicylic acid, and mesalamine; calcium entry blockers such as verapamil, diltiazem and nifedipine; antineoplastic/antiproliferative/anti-mitotic agents such as paclitaxel, 5-fluorouracil, methotrexate, doxorubicin, daunorubicin, cyclosporine, cisplatin, vinblastine, vincristine, epothilones, endostatin, angiostatin and thymidine kinase inhibitors; antimicrobials such as triclosan, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, and nitorfurantoin; anesthetic agents such as lidocaine, bupivacaine, and ropivacaine; nitric oxide (NO) donors such as lisidomine, molsidomine, L-arginine, NO-protein adducts, NO-carbohydrate adducts, polymeric or oligomeric NO adducts; anti-coagulants such as D-Phe-Pro-Arg chloromethyl ketone, an RGD peptide-containing compound, heparin, antithrombin compounds, platelet receptor antagonists, anti-thrombin antibodies, anti-platelet receptor antibodies, enoxaparin, hirudin, Warafin sodium, Dicumarol, aspirin, prostaglandin inhibitors, platelet inhibitors and tick antiplatelet factors; vascular cell growth promotors such as growth factors, growth factor receptor antagonists, transcriptional activators, and translational promoters; vascular cell growth inhibitors such as growth factor inhibitors, growth factor receptor antagonists, transcriptional repressors, translational repressors, replication inhibitors, inhibitory antibodies, antibodies directed against growth factors, bifunctional molecules consisting of a growth factor and a cytotoxin, bifunctional molecules consisting of an antibody and a cytotoxin; cholesterol-lowering agents; vasodilating agents; agents which interfere with endogeneus vascoactive mechanisms; survival genes which protect against cell death, such as anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family factors and Akt kinase; and combinations thereof. Cells can be of human origin (autologous or allogenic) or from an animal source (xenogeneic), genetically engineered if desired. The delivery mediated is formulated as needed to maintain cell function and viability. Any modifications are routinely made by one skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Polynucleotide sequences useful in practice of the invention include DNA or RNA sequences having a therapeutic effect after being taken up by a cell. Examples of therapeutic polynucleotides include anti-sense DNA and RNA; DNA coding for an anti-sense RNA; or DNA coding for tRNA or rRNA to replace defective or deficient endogenous molecules. The polynucleotides of the invention can also code for therapeutic proteins or polypeptides. A polypeptide is understood to be any translation product of a polynucleotide regardless of size, and whether glycosylated or not. Therapeutic proteins and polypeptides include as a primary example, those proteins or polypeptides that can compensate for defective or deficient species in an animal, or those that act through toxic effects to limit or remove harmful cells from the body. In addition, the polypeptides or proteins that can be injected, or whose DNA can be incorporated, include without limitation, angiogenic factors and other molecules competent to induce angiogenesis, including acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors, vascular endothelial growth factor, hif-1, epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor &agr; and &bgr;, platelet-derived endothelial growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, tumor necrosis factor &agr;, hepatocyte growth factor and insulin like growth factor; growth factors; cell cycle inhibitors including CDK inhibitors; anti-restenosis agents, including p15, p16, p18, p19, p21, p27, p53, p57, Rb, nFkB and E2F decoys, thymidine kinase (&ldquo;TK&rdquo;) and combinations thereof and other agents useful for interfering with cell proliferation, including agents for treating malignancies; and combinations thereof. Still other useful factors, which can be provided as polypeptides or as DNA encoding these polypeptides, include monocyte chemoattractant protein (&ldquo;MCP-1&rdquo;), and the family of bone morphogenic proteins (&ldquo;BMP&apos;s&rdquo;). The known proteins include BMP-2, BMP-3, BMP-4, BMP-5, BMP-6 (Vgr-1), BMP-7 (OP-1), BMP-8, BMP-9, BMP-10, BMP-11, BMP-12, BMP-13, BMP-14, BMP-15, and BMP-16. Currently preferred BMP&apos;s are any of BMP-2, BMP-3, BMP-4, BMP-5, BMP-6 and BMP-7. These dimeric proteins can be provided as homodimers, heterodimers, or combinations thereof, alone or together with other molecules. Alternatively or, in addition, molecules capable of inducing an upstream or downstream effect of a BMP can be provided. Such molecules include any of the &ldquo;hedgehog&rdquo; proteins, or the DNA&apos;s encoding them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The bubble jet printer head in this embodiment is preferably programmed to coat in a precise manner, allowing coating to be applied in a complex pattern, a pattern that matches the complex pattern of the medical appliance. It is also preferred that the droplets forced from the printer head be small in relation to the target area of the medical appliance to allow for a high degree of precision in coating the target. Precision coating of the medical appliance is preferable for the economical use of coating materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment, rather than having the coating material deposited in one coat or layer around the entire device, the bubble jet printer head may coat the medical appliance with different layers of different thicknesses in different regions of the appliance as may be desirable for the subsequent use of the appliance. In doing so, different concentrations of therapeutic may be deposited in different regions of the medical appliance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The coatings that may be applied by this printing jet may also include: lubricious coatings to reduce the stress exerted on the stent during the stent&apos;s deployment; radiopaque coatings for identifying the location of stents after implantation using traditional radiography techniques; radioactive agents that are useful in preventing tissue regrowth in and around implanted stents; and, magnetic coatings that enable identification of the location of the implanted stent using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) techniques. These magnetic coatings may be obtained using ferritic powders or paramagnetic powders such as Gadolinium or Disprosium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Another useful application of this precise coating method may be to convey information, or an identification code on the appliance itself. This information or code may then be used to identify the source of the medical appliance and other history related to it for tracking purposes.

<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows a system for coating a medical appliance using a bubble jet printer head and means for redirecting the material forced from the bubble jet printer head prior to impacting the targeted medical appliance in accord with an alternative embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment the bubble jet printer head <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> may be used to coat a medical appliance <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> as described above. However, in this embodiment, after individual bubbles of coating <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> have been forced from the printer head <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> they may be redirected or influenced by the redirecting means <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. These redirecting means <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> can be implemented using an electromagnetic field generator or an airstream jet as well as any other suitable methods that may influence the path or trajectory of the coating once it has been forced from the head <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. By employing these means <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> the distance that the head may travel may be reduced. Similarly, the head may not need to be moved back and forth as quickly as in earlier embodiments as the gross adjustments may be completed with the movement of the head <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> along a track while the finite adjustments of the forced coating may be controlled by the means <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, bubble jet printer head <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> may be controlled by the processor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, which may also control support <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and means <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. Here, the bubble jet printing head, working in concert with the support <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, which may hold, move, and rotate the medical appliance <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, may coat each of the struts <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> but not the junctions <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> as shown in the Figure. The means <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> may be mounted so that material forced from bubble jet printer head <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> passes between them before reaching medical appliance <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, if the means were to employ air pressure or some other sort of fluid force, only one means <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> may be required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows an alternative embodiment of the present invention wherein the printer head <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is in fluid communication with two sources of coating <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> bubble jet printer head <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is shown from below, from the perspective of the medical appliance. As can be seen, a matrix of nozzles may be arrayed on the bottom face of bubble jet printer head <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. This matrix may be labeled on the horizontal axis A-E and on the vertical axis <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Bubble jet printer head <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> may be controlled by processor <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and may be in fluid communication with the first coating source <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and the second coating source <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. In this exemplary embodiment, each of the nozzles in the matrix may be in fluid communication with first coating source <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and the second coating source <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and may be able to selectively force material from first coating source <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and second coating source <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> onto a medical appliance that is being coated. Thus, as necessary, nozzle B-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> may force coating from first coating source <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and then from second coating source <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> on to the appliance. Alternatively, a first group or set of the nozzles in the matrix may work in conjunction with one another and the first coating source <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> while a second group of nozzles may work together and be in fluid communication with another and the second coating source <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Then, as required, the individual groups can work in concert with one another to coat the work-piece or medical appliance. Here, the first group of nozzles may be defined as any combination of the nozzles in the matrix, including but not limited to whole rows, whole columns, and alternating rows and columns to produce a checkerboard pattern. This embodiment, thus, makes possible the application of multiple coatings of multiple materials to a medical appliance in a precise manner in one process step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates an alternative embodiment of the present invention. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, bubble jet printer head <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is shown from a side perspective view with the bottom face visible and showing the matrix of nozzles. Opposite the matrix of nozzles on bubble jet printer head <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is medical appliance <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> held in a support (which is not shown). Also evident in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is microvision system <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. This system <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> may be any number of optical observation systems including those employing laser scanners and video cameras as well as both visible and invisible light scanners. This system <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> may be used to observe the deposition of the coating onto the medical appliance <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> as well as to perform numerous other functions including verifying the position of the head <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and the appliance <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the microvision system <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> may be used for quality control, for orienting the medical appliance <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> with respect to the bubble jet printer head <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, and for tracking the external pattern of medical appliance <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> during the coating process. Therefore, processor <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> may use information received from microvision system <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> to adjust the commands it issues to bubble jet printer head <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> during the coating process. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, rather than applying a coating material with the head <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> a masking material may be applied. Once applied in a desirable pattern on the appliance <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, an etchant may then be applied with sprayer <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> to etch the exposed portions of the appliance <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> thereby etching the appliance in all regions not covered by the masking material. Then, once all the required etching is completed the masking material may be removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The sprayer <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> in this embodiment may be mounted on support <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> and may be able to slide back and forth along this support during the spraying activities. The sprayer <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> may also be in fluid communication with first and second sprayer sources, similar to the coating sources described above, which may store different etching materials for use in the process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The sprayer in this embodiment may also be used for other indiscriminate spraying applications as well, including direct etching and cleaning the medical appliance. In a direct etching application the bubble jet printer head <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> may be used to apply a corrosive material onto the medical appliance <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. Here the corrosive material may be used to selectively etch or groove portions of the various struts of the medical appliance. Alternatively, the printer head <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> may apply a first material to specific areas to be etched and, then, may apply a second material, which reacts with the first material, to etch the desired portions of the appliance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> A bubble jet printer head for coating a medical appliance is provided herein. While several embodiments have been discussed, others, within the invention&apos;s spirit and scope, are also plausible. For example, while one printer head is described in each of the above embodiments more than one printer head may also be employed. Here in this alternative embodiment, the multiple printer heads may work synchronously and asynchronously and may be ganged together to coat several appliances simultaneously. </paragraph>
