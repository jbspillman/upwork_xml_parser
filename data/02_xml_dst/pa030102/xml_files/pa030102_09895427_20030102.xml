<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates, in general, to wireless communication systems, and more particularly, to an apparatus, method and system for mobile wireless communication hand-off utilizing shared directory numbers and ISDN multiway capabilities. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Mobile wireless communication systems typically employ many base stations (such as cell sites) to provide wireless communication throughout a given geographic region. As a mobile unit may traverse the geographic region, the communication to and from the mobile unit may occur through one or more of these base stations. To maintain an ongoing communication session during such transitions between base stations, various hand-off methods have evolved to transfer the wireless communication to the mobile unit from one base station to another base station, while maintaining such an ongoing call or session. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In the prior art, for some of the various methods utilized during such hand-offs, the communication session may suffer from some degree of interruption, which may be noticeable to the consumer of wireless communication services. As a consequence, a need remains to provide for comparatively seamless hand-offs, which do not interrupt ongoing communication sessions and which are imperceptible to the consumer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In addition, while other prior art systems may provide comparatively seamless hand-offs, such hand-offs typically utilize considerable network resources. In an Autoplex&reg; system, for example, in addition to switches and base stations, another network entity referred to as an Executive Call Processor (&ldquo;ECP&rdquo;) selects a server at the new cell site, while another network entity referred to as a Call Processing Database Node (&ldquo;CDN&rdquo;) transmits various data link messages to the current and new cell sites, adding an additional path to the existing call, directing the new cell site to activate a wireless voice link, and directing the current (serving) cell site to direct the mobile to retune to the new wireless voice link at the new cell site. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> As a consequence, a need remains for a wireless communication system to provide comparatively seamless and imperceptible hand-offs. In addition, such a wireless communication system should be reasonably efficient and capable of cost-effective implementation, eliminating or minimizing the use of additional network resources. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The wireless communication system of the present invention provides virtually seamless and imperceptible hand-offs of communication sessions of mobile units. The various embodiments of the present invention are reasonably efficient and capable of cost-effective implementation in existing communication equipment such as switches and base stations. Moreover, the various embodiments of the present invention eliminate or minimize the use of additional network resources such as ECPs and CDNs, while being compatible with other intelligent network devices and systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, an apparatus, method and system are provided for hand-off of a communication session utilizing shared directory numbers and multiway capabilities, in which the communication session of a mobile unit is transferred from a serving base station to a target base station. The preferred system includes a switch coupled to a serving base station and a target base station, preferably over digital lines having multiple, independent channels, such as Integrated Services Digital Network (&ldquo;ISDN&rdquo;) lines. Typically, each of the various base stations include a plurality of terminals which handle and process the communication sessions with mobile units and, in general, one or more terminals are assigned directory numbers (&ldquo;DNs&rdquo;). In accordance with the present invention, such DNs are shared by terminals in the serving base station. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, the serving base station contains a plurality of terminals, of which two or more share a directory number. In general, the communication session to be handed off is occurring on a first call path of a first terminal that has a shared directory number. When a hand-off of the communication is indicated, a second terminal of the serving base station having the same shared directory number (of the first terminal providing the communication session), initiates a second call path to the target base station. This second call path (of the second terminal of the serving base station) is then bridged into the active communication session of the first call path (of the first terminal of the serving base station) to form a multiway communication session among the mobile unit, the two terminals of the serving base station, and via the switch, the target base station. This multiway communication session includes a bridged call path to the target base station. The mobile unit then communicates with the target base station for continuation of the communication session through the bridged call path. The first and second terminals of the serving base station are then released from the call, with the communication session continuing, uninterrupted, over the bridged call path and between the target base station and the mobile unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> As a consequence, the communication session of the mobile unit has been handed off, seamlessly and without interruption, from the serving base station to the target base station. Such a hand-off has also occurred utilizing minimal network resources, the switch and the base stations, without involvement of other intelligent or supervisory network elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The multiway communication session from the serving base station to the switch is established through the transmission of various messages between the serving base station and the switch. The switch is correspondingly configured to establish and connect the second call path to the communication session of the first call path, to form the multiway communication session, upon receipt of these various messages. In one of the embodiments, the serving base station includes instructions to transmit a call set up message to the switch, and to transmit various other messages with reference to the shared directory number and the various first and second call paths. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Numerous other advantages and features of the present invention will become readily apparent from the following detailed description of the invention and the embodiments thereof, from the claims and from the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> While the present invention is susceptible of embodiment in many different forms, there are shown in the drawings and will be described herein in detail specific embodiments thereof, with the understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered as an exemplification of the principles of the invention and is not intended to limit the invention to the specific embodiments illustrated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, a need remains for a wireless communication system to provide comparatively seamless and imperceptible hand-offs, which is reasonably efficient and capable of cost-effective implementation, and which eliminates or minimizes the use of additional network resources such as ECPs and CDNs. In accordance with the present invention, a system, apparatus and method are illustrated which provide such advantages, namely, providing relatively seamless and imperceptible wireless hand-offs while utilizing minimal network resources (namely, utilizing existing switches and base stations configured in accordance with the invention), while simultaneously eliminating the prior art utilization of other network elements such as ECPs and CDNs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a block diagram illustrating such a system embodiment <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in accordance with the present invention. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a switch <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and one or more base stations (equivalently, cell sites) <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, such as first base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>and second base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>. It should be noted that the associated transceivers or antenna arrays (not separately illustrated) of the base stations (or cell sites) <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> may be at one or more different locations or otherwise geographically distributed. Within each base station are one of more terminals <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> (illustrated as T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>), which handle calls to and from the various mobile units (equivalently, mobile stations) <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, illustrated as mobile units <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A</subscript></highlight>, <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>C</subscript></highlight>. In general, each terminal is assigned a directory number (&ldquo;DN&rdquo;), such as DN<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, or DN<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. In accordance with the present invention, two or more terminals <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> within the same base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> are assigned and share one or more of the same directory numbers. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, terminals <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>and <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>of the serving base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>are both assigned and share the same DN, DN<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, while terminals <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>C </subscript></highlight>and <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>D </subscript></highlight>of the target base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>are both assigned and share the same DN, DN<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The switch <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is preferably a telecommunication switch such as a <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> ESS&reg; switch or a <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>RE switch manufactured by Lucent Technologies, Inc., which has been configured to operate in accordance with the present invention, as discussed in greater detail below. The switch <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is coupled to a network <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, for additional call routing. The switch <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may also be included within a mobile switching center, and may also be coupled to other intelligent network devices (not illustrated). The base stations <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> include wireless transceivers for wireless communication with the various mobile units <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, such as cellular or other wireless telephones, wireless modems, or other wireless or mobile communication devices or stations. The switch <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and base stations <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> are coupled to each other utilizing signaling and/or trunking lines <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, as known in the art, and in the preferred embodiment, lines <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> (and potentially <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>) are ISDN lines, and may also be implemented with a Basic Rate Interface (&ldquo;BRI&rdquo;), and may be either custom or national ISDN implementations. In the preferred embodiment, each of the terminals <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> within a base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> may access any channel within the ISDN lines, such as a first (B) channel B<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, a second (B) channel B<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, an n<highlight><superscript>th </superscript></highlight>(B) channel B<highlight><subscript>N</subscript></highlight>, and one or more signaling or messaging channels (D). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> As any mobile unit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> traverses a geographic region and becomes farther away from any given base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> with which it has been in communication, the signal or power levels of such wireless communication to and from the mobile unit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> typically drop below a preferred threshold or range. Under these circumstances, it is preferable for the given base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to hand-off the communication to another base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> having higher signal strength to and from the given mobile unit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. Continuing to refer to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, for example, the mobile unit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>(at a time t&lt;t<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>) is currently served by a first terminal <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>of first base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A</subscript></highlight>, illustrated as communication or call paths or legs <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> (wireless) and <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> (wireline), forming a first call path, with the wireline portion (call leg <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>) using a first channel B<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>of ISDN line <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. (The portion of the communication session between the switch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the network <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is separately illustrated as call path or leg <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>). In these circumstances, the first base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>is generally referred to as a serving base station or serving cell site. As the mobile unit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>travels toward the vicinity of second base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>, it may become necessary or preferable for the first, serving base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>to hand-off the communication session of mobile unit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>to the second base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>. In these circumstances, the second base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>is generally referred to as a target base station or target cell site. Such a hand-off, in accordance with the present invention, is illustrated below with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a block diagram illustrating a system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> embodiment, with the first communication path (legs <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>) illustrated from the switch <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and first base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>to the mobile unit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>and a second communication path (legs <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>) illustrated during a hand-off, in accordance with the present invention. In the system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> embodiment illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the terminal <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>of the serving base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>shares the same directory number of terminal <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A</subscript></highlight>; terminal <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>(the &ldquo;active&rdquo; terminal) is handling the communication session of the mobile unit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A</subscript></highlight>, to be handed off to target base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>. To accomplish a hand-off in accordance with the present invention, and as explained in greater detail below, a terminal within the serving base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>which is sharing the same DN (or other call appearance) of the active terminal <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A</subscript></highlight>, in this case terminal <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>, initiates a second call path to target base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>, utilizing a second ISDN channel B<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, through call paths or legs <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. The terminal <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>of the serving base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>then sends instructions to the switch <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to place this second call, between terminal <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>and the target base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>, on &ldquo;hold&rdquo;. If the terminals <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>and <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>(T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) are not automatically bridged by virtue of having the same DN or call appearance, the first and second calls are bridged at the terminals <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>and <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>(T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). The terminal <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>then requests that the switch <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> establish a multiway (or conference) connection between the first and second independent calls to and from, respectively, terminals <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>and <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>, specifying the directory number shared by the two terminals (as a call reference). The switch then bridges the first and second independent calls, namely, call paths or legs <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, thereby establishing a multiway communication session between the serving base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>and the target base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>, via the switch <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Additional and more specific message flows and other details are discussed below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Additional variations are also within the scope of the present invention. For example, terminal <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>could use a different, non-shared directory number in establishing its communication (the second call path on legs <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>) with the target base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>. In addition, terminal <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>could use another idle call appearance of the shared DN or another idle call appearance of a different DN. Following establishment of the second, independent call path (on legs <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>) through any of these various means, the various requests and messages for creating a multiway connection then achieve the same result, i.e., a conference or multiway connection linking the two call paths of the two terminals of the serving base station with a terminal at the target base station. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> As discussed in greater detail below, this is accomplished through call set up and retrieve messages, the assignment of shared directory numbers to the terminals <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> of the base stations <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, and configuring the switch <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to recognize particular messages as a request to combine an existing communication session on a first call path with another, second call path, preferably with a specific, shared DN. The hand-off then proceeds as illustrated below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a flow diagram illustrating a method embodiment in accordance with the present invention. Beginning with start step <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, the method determines that a hand-off is necessary or preferable, step <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>. This may be accomplished through various methods known in the art, from various requests transmitted by the serving base stations, such as base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A</subscript></highlight>, with responses from the potential target base stations, such as base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>, or by determinations made by the particular mobile unit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. Next, a target base station is selected for a hand-off, also as known in the art, such as base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>, step <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> A second terminal of the serving base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A</subscript></highlight>, preferably sharing the same directory number of the first terminal <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>currently serving the first call path to the mobile station <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A</subscript></highlight>, such as terminal <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>of the serving base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A</subscript></highlight>, then establishes a second call path (illustrated as call path legs <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> in are <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) to a (third) terminal (such as terminal <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>C</subscript></highlight>) at the target base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>via the switch <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, step <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>. In the preferred embodiment, step <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> commences the hand-off by transmission of a &ldquo;SETUP&rdquo; message by terminal <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>of the serving base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>to the switch <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> for a new, second call, receives a corresponding acknowledgement from the switch <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and then transmits an information (INFO) message to the switch <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, with a designation of the shared DN (or another, different DN) in the keypad field. The switch <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, in turn, transmits call setup messages to (a terminal of) the target base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>, with various messages for alerting, connection, connection acknowledgements, and so on, between the switch <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the serving or target base stations. The call is preferably established on a second channel (B<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) available to the serving base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>on line <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Following establishment of this second call path, this second call path is placed on hold, step <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, with this second terminal (<highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>) sending a request, preferably a hold message, to the switch <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> (to place its communication on call path legs <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> on hold). Next, in step <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight>, the second call path (call legs <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>) are bridged into the communication session of the first call path (call leg <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>), forming a multiway communication session. As mentioned above, this bridging generally occurs through the transmission of various messages between the terminal <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>of the serving base station and the switch <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, discussed below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment, following establishment of the second call path (step <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>) and placing this second, independent call on hold (step <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>), bridging step <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> begins with terminal <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>of the serving base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>transmitting a first &ldquo;RETRIEVE&rdquo; message to the switch <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, having a call reference to the first call path (CR&equals;1). After acknowledging the RETRIEVE message, for a National ISDN implementation, the switch <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may also transmit a &ldquo;NOTIFY&rdquo; message to terminal <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>of the serving base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A</subscript></highlight>. Terminal <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>then transmits an information (INFO) message to the switch <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, designating a conference or other multiway feature in a feature activation field, and having a call reference to the first call path (CR&equals;1), and receives a corresponding acknowledgement from the switch <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The terminal <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>of the serving base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>transmits another (second) &ldquo;RETRIEVE&rdquo; message to the switch <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, having a call reference to the second call path (CR&minus;2), which takes the second call path off hold and selects it as the added leg to the conference, receives a corresponding acknowledgement from the switch <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and then terminal <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>of the serving base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>transmits a third &ldquo;RETRIEVE&rdquo; message to the switch <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, having a call reference to the first call path (CR&equals;1), which merges or combines the first and second call paths to form the multiway (conference) communication session between the two terminals at the serving base station, and via the switch, and the target base station. (The second call reference may also be released at this point in the process). Essentially, the second terminal <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>retrieves the held call (second call path) and bridges it into the active communication session (in the first call path), forming the multiway communication session between the serving and target base stations, via the switch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that while the messaging scheme illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> pertains to National ISDN implementations, equivalent messaging is available in Custom ISDN implementations, and are also within the scope of the present invention. For example, the &ldquo;retrieve&rdquo; messages discussed above may be replaced with equivalent &ldquo;reconnect&rdquo; and other custom ISDN messages, achieving the same result of the present invention in the same way. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Following the creation of the multiway communication session, the mobile unit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>establishes communication with the target base station (call leg <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight>), step <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, for continuation of the communication session through the bridged call path, illustrated as call path or leg <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference> (in addition to call paths <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight>), of the multiway communication session. The previously serving base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>may now disconnect and be released from the multiway communication session, tearing down call paths or legs <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> (and <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>), step <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight>. Step <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> may be accomplished through serving base station terminals <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>and <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>transmitting a &ldquo;DISCONNECT&rdquo; messages to the switch <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, followed by a &ldquo;KEY RELEASE&rdquo; message from the switch <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to terminal <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>, and other RELEASE messages and RELEASE COMPLETE messages between the switch <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the terminals <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>and <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>. Following step <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight>, the method may end, return step <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>, with the communication session continuing uninterrupted along call path legs <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight>, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment, a variety of methods may be utilized to provide for the establishment of call path <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight>. For example, the mobile unit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>may be directed by the serving base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>to tune to a channel of the target base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>; or the mobile unit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>may initiate such tuning to the target base station. To complete the hand-off, the target base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>then notifies the serving base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>that it may now drop (tear down) its portion of the three-way call (call path legs <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight>). This notification is usually accomplished through independent signaling paths, illustrated generally as signaling and/or trunking line <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Numerous advantages of the present invention may be apparent from the above discussion. First, as illustrated above, the wireless communication system of the present invention provides virtually seamless and imperceptible hand-offs of communication sessions of mobile units. Second, the various embodiments of the present invention are reasonably efficient and capable of cost-effective implementation in existing communication equipment such as switches and base stations.
