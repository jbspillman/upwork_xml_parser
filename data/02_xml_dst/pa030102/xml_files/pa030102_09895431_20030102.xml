<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention generally relates to the field of personalized media, and more specifically to dynamically updating user preferences and transporting such preferences from one entertainment device to another. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Setting user preferences on an electronic device is nothing new. There are several ways to update and store user preferences on a given device, and the devices are becoming increasingly smart and easy to use. However, the methods and devices available today are not mature enough to dynamically update user preferences. Additionally, the preference settings are not from device to device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> For instance, a user&apos;s favorite television (TV) network or channel settings cannot be transferred between two or more television sets or set-top boxes. Similarly, a user&apos;s preferences or favorite settings for web browsing or MP3 music selection may not be transferred when the user switches devices or even the program for surfing the web. Moreover, the methods and devices available today do not dynamically update user preferences, and therefore, require manual updating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> An example of a user preference-setting device is TIVO. TIVO uses a centralized system to collect information on users and updates such information from time to time. However, TIVO fails to recognize individual users, and instead, maintains information on a household-basis. Further, the information maintained by TIVO is not portable from device to device, and is only applicable to TIVO, and used for marketing purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> To obtain portability, typically a card can be used as a portable media. Cards with magnetic tapes, however, only hold limited information. Microprocessor-embedded smart cards can be programmed and personalized with users&apos; information. However, the smart cards available today are also limited in at least the following three ways: (1) information on a smart card is limited to what the issuer wants to input; (2) the information is maintained and updated by the issuer; and (3) accessibility is limited to one type of device, such as an ATM, selected by the issuer, and therefore, the smart card is not portable. </paragraph>

Such use of a portable medium makes the information accessible to multiple devices. Further, the portable medium may be used to tailor user preferences according to the device chosen by the user, and may be dynamically updated as user preferences change. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without some of these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The present invention includes various steps, which will be described below. The steps of the present invention may be performed by hardware components or may be embodied in machine-executable instructions, which may be used to cause a general-purpose or special-purpose processor or logic circuits programmed with the instructions to perform the steps. Alternatively, the steps may be performed by a combination of hardware and software. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The present invention may be provided as a computer program product, which may include a machine-readable medium having stored thereon instructions which may be used to program a computer (or other electronic devices) to perform a process according to the present invention. The machine-readable medium may include, but is not limited to, floppy diskettes, optical disks, CD-ROMs, and magneto-optical disks, ROMs, RAMs, EPROMs, EEPROMs, magnetic or optical cards, flash memory, or other type of media/machine-readable medium suitable for storing electronic instructions. Moreover, the present invention may also be downloaded as a computer program product, wherein the program may be transferred from a remote computer to a requesting computer by way of data signals embodied in a carrier wave or other propagation medium via a communication link (e.g., a modem or network connection). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a block diagram of a typical computer system upon which one embodiment of the present invention may be implemented. Computer system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> comprises a bus or other communication means <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> for communicating information, and a processing means such as processor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> coupled with bus <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> for processing information. Computer system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> further comprises a random access memory (RAM) or other dynamic storage device <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> (referred to as main memory), coupled to bus <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> for storing information and instructions to be executed by processor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Main memory <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> also may be used for storing temporary variables or other intermediate information during execution of instructions by processor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Computer system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> also comprises a read only memory (ROM) and/or other static storage device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> coupled to bus <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> for storing static information and instructions for processor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A data storage device <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> such as a magnetic disk or optical disc and its corresponding drive may also be coupled to computer system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> for storing information and instructions. Computer system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can also be coupled via bus <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to a display device <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, such as a cathode ray tube (CRT) or Liquid Crystal Display (LCD), for displaying information to an end user. Typically, an alphanumeric input device <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, including alphanumeric and other keys, may be coupled to bus <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> for communicating information and/or command selections to processor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Another type of user input device is cursor control <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>, such as a mouse, a trackball, or cursor direction keys for communicating direction information and command selections to processor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and for controlling cursor movement on display <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> A communication device <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> is also coupled to bus <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. The communication device <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> may include a modem, a network interface card, or other well-known interface devices, such as those used for coupling to Ethernet, token ring, or other types of physical attachment for purposes of providing a communication link to support a local or wide area network, for example. In this manner, the computer system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be coupled to a number of clients and/or servers via a conventional network infrastructure, such as a company&apos;s Intranet and/or the Internet, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> It is appreciated that a lesser or more equipped computer system than the example described above may be desirable for certain implementations. Therefore, the configuration of computer system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> will vary from implementation to implementation depending upon numerous factors, such as price constraints, performance requirements, technological improvements, and/or other circumstances. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that, while the steps described herein may be performed under the control of a programmed processor, such as processor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, in alternative embodiments, the steps may be fully or partially implemented by any programmable or hard-coded logic, such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), TTL logic, or Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), for example. Additionally, the method of the present invention may be performed by any combination of programmed general-purpose computer components and/or custom hardware components. Therefore, nothing disclosed herein should be construed as limiting the present invention to a particular embodiment wherein the recited steps are performed by a specific combination of hardware components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a block diagram illustrating an exemplary network upon which the present invention may be implemented. In this example, an Ethernet network <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is shown. Such a network may utilize Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). Of course, many other types of networks and protocols are available and are commonly used. However, for illustrative purposes, Ethernet and TCP/IP will be referred to herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Connected to this network <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> are computers <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, devices <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, and wireless Input/Output (I/O) devices <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>. The computers <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> may include a network administrator terminal <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. A human operator could use this network administrator terminal <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> to monitor and maintain the network. The devices <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> may include network attached storage devices or other types of non-terminal devices or devices for the users to use that are compatible with smart cards. The wireless I/O devices <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> may include remote controls helping certain devices communicate with the system. The number and arrangement of this equipment may vary depending on the application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a block diagram illustrating an overview of a process for communicating user preferences using a smart card, according to one embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated, the card issuing system (issuer) <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> issues smart cards <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> to users. A user may use a smart card <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> with any of the compatible devices, such as computers <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, television sets <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight>, and PDAs <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. The smart cards available today typically only include user demographic and preference information, as tailored by the issuer, for use with only one designated device, such as an ATM. Thus, using the smarts cards available today, if any of the user information or preferences needs to be updated, a user would have to request the issuer to re-configure the smart card or issue a new smart card containing the updated information. Nevertheless, the smart card would remain compatible with only one device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> According to one embodiment of the present invention, the issuer <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> issues a smart card <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> with basic user demographic and preference information and user history templates compatible with multiple devices <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. A user may insert the smart card <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> in any of the compatible devices <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> of his or her choice. The user history templates, according to one embodiment of the present invention, are compatible with multiple corresponding devices <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, and can be used to store and update user preferences. The user may choose to manually update user preferences using any one of the devices <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> or let the smart card <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> or devices <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> detect user patterns and update user preferences automatically based on the detected pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> For example, a user inserts the smart card into a slot in a television set <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight>. Upon inserting the smart card <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>, the system <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> identifies the user using the identification information (such as userid/password) assigned by the issuer <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. Upon user identification, user preferences are identified, and are translated into the format recognized by the device <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight>. Similarly, the smart card <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> identifies the device <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> and may communicate with the issuer <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, if necessary. Upon identifying the device <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight>, the smart card <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> generates a template to compile, maintain, and store user history, and automatically update user preferences based on the criteria initially set by the user and/or issuer <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. The criteria may track for information such as how many times a television program was watched in a given time period. In addition to the smart card automatically updating user preferences, the user may also manually update user preferences using the device <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight>. Further, the user may use the same smart card <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> with a different device, such as a computer <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</cross-reference> illustrate components of a personalized media consumption system, according to one embodiment of the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> illustrates three templates <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> residing within the system the system <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, according to one embodiment of the present invention. An issuer may input user identification information <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> and user preferences <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> in a smart card at the time of issuance. The system <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> may retrieve an identification template <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> from a template database for obtaining the user information <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>. Similarly, the system <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> may obtain a user preference template <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> corresponding to the device chosen by the user from the template database for indentifying user preferences <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> for the device chosen. Further, a blank user history template my reside with the system, however it is typically populated <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> only after the smart card is used at least once. Upon activating the smart card into a device, such as television, the identification module <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> is activated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In the example illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>B, the identification module <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> performs two forms of identification. First, the user is identified <highlight><bold>425</bold></highlight> based on user identification, such as userid or password. Then, the system <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> identifies the device <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> in order to conform to the requirements of the device <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight>. For example, an identification template <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> may be retrieved from template database corresponding to the device chosen by the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The templates may be obtained from and stored in a variety of sources, such as the issuer, the smart card, or the device. For instance, the template database may reside with the issuer, and the issuer may provide the applicable templates as they are needed. The smart card may also contain a set of templates, which may be retrieved as they are needed. Further, a device may be configured to store corresponding templates for retrieval and future use. The system may have any combination of the issuer, the smart card, the device, or any other source or database for storing and retrieving templates. For example, the user may retrieve a template from the issuer or smart card, and at anytime after that may choose to save the template on the device for retrieving the saved information in the future. The user may choose to save only a copy of the template on the device and keep the original on the smart card (or vice versa) for portability. The analyzer <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> then works to analyze the data, such as television programming, to generate usage history <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The analyzer <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>, based on the retrieved template, analyzes the behavior pattern of the user in order to automatically update user preferences <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> for future use. In the embodiment depicted, the analyzer <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> comprises three components, a text analyzer <highlight><bold>445</bold></highlight>, an audio analyzer <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight>, and a video analyzer <highlight><bold>455</bold></highlight>, where either one or any combination of the components may be used. The text analyzer <highlight><bold>445</bold></highlight> analyzes text, such as closed caption information, of a program to determine user patterns based on the criteria set forth in user preferences <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> either by the user or by the issuer. The audio analyzer <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> analyzes audio information associated with a program searching for key words, phrases, and categories defined in the criteria set forth in the user preferences <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. Finally, the video analyzer <highlight><bold>455</bold></highlight> analyzes the sequence of motions in a program in order to determine the category of the program as defined in user preferences. The outcome of the analyzer <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> is a meta description <highlight><bold>462</bold></highlight> about the semantic meaning of contents that in turn is fed into a data management and configuration module <highlight><bold>465</bold></highlight> along with any user manual input <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> As illustrated, as an example, in user preferences <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, the user likes watching sports, but limits his interest to watching only the Los Angeles Lakers basketball games. Let us suppose that the user history <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> sets the criteria according to which watching a program three times a week is defined as a most watched program, while a program currently in the user preferences but not watched for three weeks is categorized as the least watched program. For example, the user in this case watches the Portland Trailblazers games, of which only one was against the Lakers, three times in one week. Following that week, the user stops watching the Lakers for three weeks. According to one embodiment of the present invention, the Trailblazers will be added to user preferences <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> at the end of the week in which the user watched the Trailblazers three times. In other words, user preferences <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> will be updated to have both the Lakers and Trailblazers listed. However, three weeks later, if this pattern continued, the Lakers would be dropped from user preferences <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> as one of the least watched programs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In the example set forth above, according to one embodiment of the present invention, the text analyzer <highlight><bold>445</bold></highlight> first analyzes closed caption information, if available, noting the key terms such as Lakers, Trailblazers, dunk, assist. The audio analyzer <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> simultaneously searches for key terms in the audio of the program to determine with what frequency (e.g., how many times a week) the program is being watched. The video analyzer <highlight><bold>455</bold></highlight>, meanwhile, analyzes motion activity of the program to determine the type of programming. For instance, a basketball game has a left-right/right-left motion as opposed to basketball news/commentary. A combination of the video analyzer <highlight><bold>455</bold></highlight>, the ext analyzer <highlight><bold>445</bold></highlight>, and the audio analyzer <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> provides enough information to determine specifically what program the user is watching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The database management and configuration module <highlight><bold>465</bold></highlight> then receives the analyzed data (meta description) from the analyzer <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> and any data that the user inputs manually <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight>. Once collected, the data is managed and configured. For instance, the database management and configuration module <highlight><bold>465</bold></highlight> parses the metadata, which may be expressed using different standards or formats (e.g., RDF, MPEG-7, TV-AnyTime). Further, the database management and configuration module <highlight><bold>465</bold></highlight> configures the data by first querying for any conflicts between the data received from the analyzer <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>, and received via the user&apos;s manual input <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight>. According to one embodiment, in the event that there is a conflict between the two sets of data, the data entered by the user <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight> outweighs the analyzed data. For instance, if the analyzed data determines that the Lakers should be removed from user preferences <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, but the user, realizing that the Lakers will be removed from the list, reenters the term &ldquo;Lakers,&rdquo; the term will remain part of the user preference template <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. Based on such information, the system tracks user history <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> and dynamically updates user preferences <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, and stores it <highlight><bold>475</bold></highlight> for future use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5 a</cross-reference> flow diagram illustrating personalized media consumption system processing, according to one embodiment of the present invention. First, the issuer issues a smart card to a user may be with initial information such as user identification information and user preferences. The user inserts the smart card into a device choosing from multiple media devices in processing block <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>. The system first identifies the user in processing block <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, and then identifies the device in processing block <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight>. An identification template retrieved from a template database with the user and device information may be used for identification purposes. The system retrieves a user preference template corresponding to the chosen device from the template database. User preferences associated with the device are identified using the corresponding user preference template in processing block <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>. A user history template is retrieved from a template database corresponding to the device chosen by the user. The template is used to track user pattern and gather usage data in processing block <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight>. As mentioned above, with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, that a template, including the user history template, may by stored in and retrieved from any combination of sources and databases including, but not limited to, the issuer, the smart card, and the device. The analyzer analyzes the data read, listened to, and/or viewed by the user using an analyzer comprising one or more of a text analyzer, an audio analyzer, and a video analyzer in processing block <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>. The analyzed data (meta description) is transferred to the database management and configuration module <highlight><bold>465</bold></highlight> in processing block <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> At decision block <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight>, the system determines whether the user manually entered any information. If no such information was entered, the analyzed data is parsed and configured in the database management and configuration module <highlight><bold>465</bold></highlight> having priority and importance over the analyzed data in processing block <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight>. The resulting data is then used to update user preferences at processing block <highlight><bold>545</bold></highlight>. Finally, the data is stored for future reference in processing block <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>. If the user elected to enter information, such information is transferred to data management and configuration module <highlight><bold>465</bold></highlight> in processing block <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight> along with the analyzed data. The resulting data is then used to update user preferences in processing block <highlight><bold>545</bold></highlight>. Finally, the data is stored for future reference in processing block <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a block diagram illustrating components of a personalized media consumption system including integration of data, according to one embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated, for example, the user first accesses a computer <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight> to access NBA.com to find out about the Lakers&apos; performance against the Trailblazers during the first round of the NBA Playoffs 2000-01 using a smart card. The system <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> identifies and verifies the user <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> and identifies the device <highlight><bold>615</bold></highlight>. The user reads the text and statistics detailing the performance of the Lakers. Once the device, the computer <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight>, is identified <highlight><bold>615</bold></highlight>, a user preference template containing user preferences associated with the computer <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight> is retrieved <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> for identifying the user preferences. Similarly, a user history template suited for tracking website usage history <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight> is retrieved. The data transferred to or from the website is then analyzed <highlight><bold>625</bold></highlight> and the resulting meta description <highlight><bold>627</bold></highlight> is transferred to the database management and configuration module <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight> along with the data manually entered by the user <highlight><bold>635</bold></highlight>, if any. The combined data is then parsed and configured in the database management and configuration module <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The user then uses a different device, for example, a television set <highlight><bold>650</bold></highlight> to learn more about the Lakers&apos; performance in the first round of the playoffs on NBC, which broadcasts an interview with the Lakers&apos; coach, Phil Jackson. Following the same process, as described above, the meta description (or the analyzed data) is transferred to the database management and configuration module <highlight><bold>675</bold></highlight> along with data manually entered by the user <highlight><bold>680</bold></highlight>, if any. The combined data is then parsed and configured in the database management and configuration module <highlight><bold>675</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> According to one embodiment of the present invention, the parsed and configured data is then transferred to the integration module <highlight><bold>685</bold></highlight> for integration. The data management and configuration module <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight> receives the meta description and user data in different formats, such as MPEG-7, RDF, and TV-AnyTime, and parses the data using parsers for different formats, and then translates the data into a common descriptor. The common descriptor is used for the integration module <highlight><bold>685</bold></highlight> to recognize and process the data. The parsed data and all its associated content may be sent to the integration module <highlight><bold>685</bold></highlight> through an Application Programming Interface (API) or using an extensible markup language (XML). Further, the integration module <highlight><bold>685</bold></highlight> may include a content filter for filtering out unwanted or overlapping information or even when integrating the data. The integration module <highlight><bold>685</bold></highlight> may sort and/or prioritize the data for the user, based, for instance, on user preferences or criteria set forth by the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Using the Lakers&apos; example, the data management and configuration module <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight> may use a common descriptor, such as &ldquo;Lakers&rdquo;, and the website information and Phil Jackson&apos;s interview as content associated with the common descriptor &ldquo;Lakers&rdquo;. The integration module <highlight><bold>685</bold></highlight> then filters the unwanted or overlapping information, for example, general interview questions regarding Phil Jackson&apos;s career as a coach prior to joining the Lakers, which may not include any Lakers-related discussion, and therefore is classified as unwanted information. Finally, the filtered data may be sorted and prioritized, for instance, into a set of user-defined topics retrieved from the criteria set forth by the user or by tracking user history. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> A separate multipurpose template <highlight><bold>690</bold></highlight> is retrieved for maintaining the integrated data, which is used to update user preferences, and is stored <highlight><bold>695</bold></highlight> for future use. According to one embodiment of the present invention, the user may choose to display <highlight><bold>697</bold></highlight> the integrated data on any of the compatible devices, such as computers, televisions (with/without a set-top box), kiosks/web terminals, PDAs, portable media players, cellular phones. For example, when the user accesses his set-top box or computer with broadband connection, among stories of other interests, he will see the Lakers&apos; first round performance story containing the broadcast-quality television video highlights of the coach&apos;s interview seamlessly integrated with the summary of the website story. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> According to one embodiment of the present invention, the integrated data may be accessed at anytime and from anywhere. For example, the data may be stored at a service center or cached by a local storage of the client device to achieve the timesharing functionality. The data may also be accessed using various devices, such as personal computers, PDAs, kiosks/web terminals, portable media players, televisions (with/without a set-top box), cellular phones. However, the data may be displayed in a form in accordance with the display device chosen by the user. For example, both full-motion video and text story may be rendered simultaneously on a PC with a broadband connection, while a PDA may only display the text. The device capability profiles and different display choices may be expressed using various emerging standards, such as CC/PP and XSL from W3C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> According to one embodiment of the present invention, the data is not required to be integrated, and may be stored <highlight><bold>695</bold></highlight> and displayed <highlight><bold>697</bold></highlight> in a segregated form <highlight><bold>698</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>699</bold></highlight>. This allows the user to watch the entire interview and/or read the entire website story separately, and even follow the hyperlinks in the article if the user chooses to do so. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a flow diagram illustrating the process of personalizing and integrating user information in a media consumption system, according to one embodiment of the present invention. First, the data from multiple devices along with data manually entered, if any, by the user is analyzed using corresponding device templates in processing block <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight>. The outcome of the analysis (meta description) is then transferred to the data management and configuration module for further processing in processing block <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>. At processing block <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>, in the data management and configuration module, the data is parsed, configured, and translated into a common descriptor to be used for updating user preferences, storage for future use, display, and integration, if necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> At decision block <highlight><bold>715</bold></highlight>, the user decides whether to integrate the data received from the management and configuration module. If the data is to be integrated, an integrated template is retrieved in processing block <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight>. The integrator then integrates the data using the integrated template by filtering, sorting and prioritizing the data having the common descriptor in processing block <highlight><bold>725</bold></highlight>. The integrated data is used to update user preferences in processing block <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight>. Further, the integrated data is stored for future use in processing block <highlight><bold>735</bold></highlight>. A user may choose to display the integrated data on a display device of the user&apos;s choice in processing block <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight>. If the data is not to be integrated, the segregated data is used to update user preferences in processing block <highlight><bold>745</bold></highlight>. Further, the segregated data is also stored for future use in processing block <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight>. As with the integrated data, the user may choose to display the segregated data on a display device of his or her choice in processing block <highlight><bold>755</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
