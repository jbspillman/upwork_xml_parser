<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to media streaming, in general, and more specifically to providing uninterrupted media streaming using multiple network sites. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The idea of providing uninterrupted media streaming is nothing new. Many attempts have been made to provide uninterrupted media streaming without any glitches or interruptions. However, the methods and apparatus available today primarily rely on directing and redirecting a client (viewer/listener) to the site initially linked, with an expectation that the user will get an interrupted stream of media at least most of the time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Typically, a client accesses a network, and requests certain media content. In response to the request from the client, a site is contacted for providing the requested media content to the client. In the event of a problem, such as disconnection or congestion, the client is redirected back to the original site for reconnection. Therefore, the recovery provided by such a system is limited to serving the requested media content from a particular site, with an expectation that the server keeps serving the requested media content to the client. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The methods and apparatus available today have numerous common problems. For instance, linking back to the original site is understandably very disruptive for clients, because it requires a network to re-process the original link, causing the loss of continuity. Further, upon re-linking, clients have no choice but to experience the media content from the very beginning even if they only wish to reconnect from the time of disconnection. Some media players and broadcasters provide client-side buffering of a few seconds of data in order to compensate for momentary delays in packet delivery. However, such a feature is only effective with an assigned server, and fails if the server crashes or becomes inaccessible for any reason. None of the methods and apparatus, available today, provide clients with the flexibility of choosing from multiple network sites in the event of a problem or attempt to provide automatic and transparent error recovery. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> A method and apparatus are described for providing uninterrupted media streaming. Broadly stated, embodiments of the present invention allow a user (viewer/listener) to receive a reliable uninterrupted stream of media irrespective of disturbance, using multiple network sites. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> A system, apparatus, and method are provided for providing uninterrupted media streaming by accessing multiple network sites. According to one embodiment of the present invention, in response to a request from a client for media content, a list of preferred edges sites is generated. The list is then forwarded to the client. A first site from the list is accessed and requested for providing the media content to the client. In the event of a disturbance, a second site from the list is accessed and requested for providing continuous and uninterrupted streaming of the requested media content. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> According to one embodiment, an Intelligent Media Accessor runs on the user machine to provide automatic and transparent error recovery. The Intelligent Media Accessor may run in the background and monitor the user&apos;s progress with the requested media. If the Intelligent Media Accessor detects any one of several predetermined conditions, such as pausing of the media due to network congestion or loss of the connection, it selects an alternate site from a list provided by the media delivery network. The Intelligent Media Accessor may also access the media with a request to seek into it according to the amount the user had already viewed/listened to. In this manner, the user is able to experience the media in a continuous fashion as a reliable uninterrupted stream from the media delivery network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> According to another embodiment, the Intelligent Media Accessor performs site selection among a plurality of sites offering the desired media using quality metrics measured by sampling portions of the desired media from the plurality of sites. For example, prior to establishing an initial connection or in the background during media viewing, the Intelligent Media Accessor may access small samples of a clip from one or more other sites in the list of preferred edge sites and measure the quality of the media as viewed by the viewer. Then, transparently to the user, the Intelligent Media Accessor may switch the viewer to the site that produces the best results. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without some of these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The present invention includes various steps, which will be described below. The steps of the present invention may be performed by hardware components or may be embodied in machine-executable instructions, which may be used to cause a general-purpose or special-purpose processor or logic circuits programmed with the instructions to perform the steps. Alternatively, the steps may be performed by a combination of hardware and software. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The present invention may be provided as a computer program product, which may include a machine-readable medium having stored thereon instructions, which may be used to program a computer (or other electronic devices) to perform a process according to the present invention. The machine-readable medium may include, but is not limited to, floppy diskettes, optical disks, CD-ROMs, and magneto-optical disks, ROMs, RAMs, EPROMs, EEPROMs, magnetic or optical cards, flash memory, or other type of media/machine-readable medium suitable for storing electronic instructions. Moreover, the present invention may also be downloaded as a computer program product, wherein the program may be transferred from a remote computer to a requesting computer by way of data signals embodied in a carrier wave or other propagation medium via a communication link (e.g., a modem or network connection). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Importantly, while embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to viewers and streaming video, the apparatus and methods described herein are equally applicable to various other types of media and multimedia. For example, viewers and/or listeners may receive steaming audio and video, streaming audio, text, graphics, animation, data, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a block diagram of a typical computer system upon which one embodiment of the present invention may be implemented. Computer system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> comprises a bus or other communication means <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> for communicating information, and a processing means such as processor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> coupled with bus <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> for processing information. Computer system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> further comprises a random access memory (RAM) or other dynamic storage device <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> (referred to as main memory), coupled to bus <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> for storing information and instructions to be executed by processor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Main memory <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> also may be used for storing temporary variables or other intermediate information during execution of instructions by processor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Computer system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> also comprises a read only memory (ROM) and/or other static storage device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> coupled to bus <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> for storing static information and instructions for processor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> A data storage device <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> such as a magnetic disk or optical disc and its corresponding drive may also be coupled to computer system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> for storing information and instructions. Computer system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can also be coupled via bus <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to a display device <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, such as a cathode ray tube (CRT) or Liquid Crystal Display (LCD), for displaying information to an end user. Typically, an alphanumeric input device <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, including alphanumeric and other keys, may be coupled to bus <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> for communicating information and/or command selections to processor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Another type of user input device is cursor control <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>, such as a mouse, a trackball, or cursor direction keys for communicating direction information and command selections to processor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and for controlling cursor movement on display <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> A communication device <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> is also coupled to bus <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. The communication device <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> may include a modem, a network interface card, or other well-known interface devices, such as those used for coupling to Ethernet, token ring, or other types of physical attachment for purposes of providing a communication link to support a local or wide area network, for example. In this manner, the computer system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be coupled to a number of clients and/or servers via a conventional network infrastructure, such as a company&apos;s Intranet and/or the Internet, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> It is appreciated that a lesser or more equipped computer system than the example described above may be desirable for certain implementations. Therefore, the configuration of computer system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> will vary from implementation to implementation depending upon numerous factors, such as price constraints, performance requirements, technological improvements, and/or other circumstances. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that, while the steps described herein may be performed under the control of a programmed processor, such as processor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, in alternative embodiments, the steps may be fully or partially implemented by any programmable or hard-coded logic, such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), TTL logic, or Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), for example. Additionally, the method of the present invention may be performed by any combination of programmed general-purpose computer components and/or custom hardware components. Therefore, nothing disclosed herein should be construed as limiting the present invention to a particular embodiment wherein the recited steps are performed by a specific combination of hardware components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a block diagram illustrating an exemplary network upon which the present invention may be implemented. In this example, an Ethernet network <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is shown. Such a network may utilize Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). Of course, many other types of networks and protocols are available and are commonly used. However, for illustrative purposes, Ethernet and TCP/IP will be referred to herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> As illustrated, connected to this typical multimedia broadcast network <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> are a number of geographically dispersed sites, i.e., server farms, connected to each other via private links or the Internet. It is widely known in the art that multimedia, by definition, may include the use of text, graphics, animation, audio, and video. Generally, all audio and video applications are considered multimedia applications. Broadcasting generally refers to transmission of data to everyone on a given network, where the network refers to any arrangement of elements that are interconnected. Hence, a multimedia broadcast network <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> may comprise transmitting any combination of voice, video and/or data between users and/or devices that are interconnected. It includes cables and all supporting hardware such as bridges, routers and switches, and in a wireless system, antennas and towers are also part of the network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> One or more of the dispersed sites are configured as data centers <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>. A data center <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> is a centralized facility having a master copy of all media content in the network <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. The remaining dispersed sites are configured as edge sites <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. The edge sites <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are not centralized, and are typically used to cache high demand content. Since, the storage capabilities at the data center <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> and edge sites <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are vastly different, typically only some portion of the media content is actually cached at the edge sites <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> According to one embodiment of the present invention, a preferred list of the edge sites <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is dynamically generated in response to a media request made by a client <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, such as a video viewer or audio player, for the client <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> to access. In case of disturbance with media streaming from a site on the preferred list, an alternate site is accessed to maintain an uninterrupted and high-quality stream of the requested media content. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The network <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> may comprise a set of computers <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, which may include a network administrator terminal <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. A human operator could use this network administrator terminal <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> to monitor and maintain the network <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. Further, a set of devices <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight> attached to the network <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> may include network attached storage devices or other types of non-terminal devices. The number and arrangement of this equipment may vary depending on the application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a block diagram illustrating various interactions between a media delivery network, according to one embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated, a client application <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>, such as a video viewer or audio player (media player), having an Intelligent Media Accessor (IMA) <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight>, accesses a network <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> via the Internet <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, and requests media content. A data center <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> dynamically generates a list of preferred edge sites in response to the media request. The data center <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> then forwards the list to the IMA <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> for accessing the preferred edge sites <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The data center <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> is configured to hold the main repository <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> of the media content, while the edge sites <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> comprise subsets <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>355</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> of the main repository <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>. Further, the data center <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> holds a table or map <highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight> indicating the media content of the edge sites <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. According to one embodiment, the data center <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> generates the preferred list based on a predetermined criteria. The predetermined criteria may include availability of the media content, such as selecting only those edge sites that contain the requested media content. The predetermined criteria may also include selecting edge sites that are close in geographic proximity. Further, the predetermined criteria may include considering those edge sites with a potential for providing acceptable quality-level of the media content, and may include considering edge sites that are not too busy or are free of network congestion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> According to one embodiment of the present invention, the IMA <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> contacts a first <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> of the preferred edge sites, the most preferred edge site, for providing the requested media content to the media player <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>. Upon receiving the request, the first edge site <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> begins to send the requested media content. According to one embodiment, the IMA <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> may run in the background and monitor the media player&apos;s <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> progress relating to streaming of the requested media content, while the media player <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> experiences the requested media content from the first edge site <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. If the IMA <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> notices any other disturbance relating to the streaming of the requested media content, such as pausing of the requested media content, network congestion, or loss of connection, the IMA <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> accesses a second edge site <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight>, the second most preferred edge site, based on the predetermined criteria. The IMA <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> solicits the second edge site <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> on the list for continuous streaming of the media content for the media player <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> (without the knowledge of the media player <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>). Upon receiving the request, the second edge site <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> starts providing the requested media content to the media player <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>, maintaining the uninterrupted stream of information. However, in the event that the second edge site <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> is interrupted, the IMA <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> accesses the next best/preferred edge site <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> on the list for maintaining a continuous flow of the requested media content. Hence, a continuous and uninterrupted flow of the requested media content is provided to the media player <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> According to one embodiment of the present invention, the IMA <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> accesses the edge sites <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> with a request to seek into it the amount of the requested media content the media player <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> has already experienced, e.g., up to the point of disconnection. This allows the media player <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> to experience continuity without requiring it to go back to the beginning of the requested media content, and search for the point of disconnection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Further, according to one embodiment of the present invention, for quality purposes and potentially for site selection as described below, the IMA <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> accesses and evaluates small samples of media clips from edge sites <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> on the preferred list, and switches the media player <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> transparently to the edge site that produces the best result. This allows the media player <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> to continuously experience the highest quality of the requested media content. Hence, the media player <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> remains completely unaware of streaming and quality problems, and continuous to experience uninterrupted requested media content, with highest available quality. The IMA <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight>, according to one embodiment, may evaluate the samples before accessing the first site, and therefore, may first contact the site with the potential of providing the highest quality of the media content. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> According to one embodiment of the present invention, the IMA <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> may introduce various quality-levels to evaluate the quality and streaming of the requested media content based on user preferences. For instance, the media player <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> may request the IMA <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> to access the next best available edge site on the list in the event that the quality of the requested media content falls below a certain quality-level, or to access an alternate edge site if that edge site may provide better quality of the media content than the current edge site. This is to maintain the highest available quality-level for receiving the requested media content. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> According to one embodiment of the present invention, the IMA <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> stays fully aware of the speed at which the media player <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> may access the network <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a flow diagram illustrating various interactions between components of a media delivery network, according to one embodiment of the present invention. First, a client application, such as a video viewer or an audio player (media player) having an Intelligent Media Accessor accesses a network and requests media content in processing block <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>. A data center receives the request, and upon receiving the request, generates a list of preferred edge sites for the IMA to access in processing block <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. The IMA contacts the first edge site on the list for providing the requested media content to the media player in processing block <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight>. The first edge site sends the requested media content to the media player in processing block <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>. While the media player experiences the requested media content, the IMA monitors the player&apos;s progress of the requested media content in relation to the first edge site in processing block <highlight><bold>425</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> According to one embodiment, the user&apos;s progress is monitored both in terms of streaming and quality of the requested media content. At decision block <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>, the IMA inquires whether the media player is experiencing any disturbance, such as network congestion, disconnection, poor quality, or any other problems relating to the streaming of the requested media content. If no such problem is encountered, the media player continues to receive the requested media content at the highest quality-level available from the first edge site in processing block <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>. However, in the event of a disruption in and/or poor quality of the streaming of the requested media content from the first edge site, the IMA requests continuous information from the second, the next best available, edge site in processing block <highlight><bold>435</bold></highlight>. Upon receiving the request, the second edge site delivers the requested media content to the media player in processing block <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>. The IMA continues to monitor the media player&apos;s progress in processing block <highlight><bold>445</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> At decision block <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight>, the IMA continues to determine whether the media player is experiencing disturbance relating to the streaming and/or the quality of the requested media content form the second edge site. In the event that the media player encounters problems in receiving the requested media content from the second edge site, the IMA requests the requested media content from the next best edge site on the list for providing the uninterrupted stream in processing block <highlight><bold>455</bold></highlight>, and the accessed site provides the requested media content in processing block <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight>. In the absence of a problem with the second edge site, the second edge site continues to provide the requested media content in processing block <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a flow diagram illustrating a process of serving a media request, and various interactions between a data center and other components of a media delivery network, according to one embodiment of the present invention. First, the data center receives the media request from a client in processing block <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>. Upon receiving the media request from the client, the data center generates a list of preferred edge sites in processing block <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>. The list is generated by selecting a set of preferred edge sites from all the edge sites available on the network, based on a predetermined criteria. The predetermined criteria may include considering whether the edge sites have the requested media content, their geographical proximity to each other and the client, quality-level of the media content, and if they are congestion free. The list is then returned to the client for accessing the preferred edge sites and receiving the requested media content in processing block <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a flow diagram illustrating a process of placing a media request and receiving media content, and various interactions between a client and other components of a media delivery network, according to one embodiment of the present invention. The client, such as a video viewer or audio player, having an Intelligent Media Accessor, places a request for media content in processing block <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight>. A list of preferred edge sites containing the requested media content is then received in processing block <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>. Once the list is received, a first edge site, the most preferred edge site, on the list is accessed for requesting and receiving the media content in processing block <highlight><bold>615</bold></highlight>. The process of receiving the media content from the first edge site is constantly monitored for possible streaming-related and quality-related disturbances in processing block <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight>. At decision block <highlight><bold>625</bold></highlight>, if there is disturbance, a second edge site from the list is accessed for providing the media content in processing block <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight>, else the first edge sites continues to provide the media content in processing block <highlight><bold>615</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a flow diagram illustrating a process of receiving media content, and various interactions between an Intelligent Media Accessor (IMA) and other components of a media delivery network, according to one embodiment of the present invention. The IMA receives a list of preferred edge sites, generated by a data center in response to a media request placed by a client, containing the requested media content in processing block <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight>. Once the list is received, a first edge site, the most preferred edge site, on the list is accessed for requesting and receiving the media content in processing block <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>. The process of receiving the media content from the first edge site is constantly monitored by the IMA for possible streaming-related and quality-related disturbances in processing block <highlight><bold>715</bold></highlight>. At decision block <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight>, if there is disturbance, a second edge site from the list is accessed for providing the media content in processing block <highlight><bold>725</bold></highlight>, else the first edge sites continues to provide the media content in processing block <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are flow diagrams illustrating a site selection process, according to one embodiment of the present invention. According to one embodiment, an Intelligent Media Accessor (IMA) performs site selection among a plurality of sites offering the desired media using quality metrics measured by sampling portions of the desired media from the plurality of sites. For example, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>prior to establishing an initial connection, the Intelligent Media Accessor may access small samples of a clip from one or more sites in the list of preferred edge sites and measure the quality of the media in processing block <highlight><bold>805</bold></highlight>. Then, access the site with the best quality of the media in processing block <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Further, the Intelligent Media Accessor monitors and measures quality even during the experiencing of media. For example, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>a viewer is receiving media from a first site in the list of preferred edge sites in processing block <highlight><bold>850</bold></highlight>. In the background, during media viewing, the Intelligent Media Accessor may access small samples of a clip from one or more other sites in the list of preferred edge sites and measure the quality of the media in processing block <highlight><bold>855</bold></highlight>. At decision block <highlight><bold>860</bold></highlight>, the IMA determines whether there is a site that can produce better results than the current site. If there is one, then, transparently to the user, the IMA may switch the viewer to the site that produces the best results in processing <highlight><bold>865</bold></highlight>. If not, the viewer continues to receive the media from the first site in processing block <highlight><bold>850</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
