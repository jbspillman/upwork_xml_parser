<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to a system for testing integrated circuits (ICs), and, more particularly, to a method and apparatus for high speed testing of ICs having either logic circuits, memory arrays or both. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Manufacturers in the electronic industry use test systems to automatically test various electronic components and integrated circuits (ICs) to weed out defective devices or ICs. Broadly, there are two types of test systems, those suitable for testing memory arrays or circuits, such as flash memory or Random Access Memories (RAM), those suitable for testing logic circuits, such as Micro Controllers, Application Specific ICs (ASICs), and Programmable Logic Devices (PLDs). Generally, it is desirable to test the ICs at several points during the manufacturing process including while they are still part of a wafer or substrate and after packaging the devices before they are mounted or assembled on modules, cards or boards. This repetitive testing imposes demands on test systems to automatically perform tests at high speed and with a high degree of accuracy. Moreover, the trend in the electronic industry has been to further increase the miniaturization of electronic devices and circuits, thereby allowing for an increase in the complexity of the IC. Thus, as ICs become more complex, the complexity of the test systems must increase correspondingly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> An example of part of a prior art logic test system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for testing logic circuits in an IC, commonly known as a Device Under Test or DUT <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having a number of pins <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, test system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> typically includes a general purpose computer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> or PC, a clock <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, logic vector memory (LVM <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>) with a sequencer, a number of timing and format circuits (T/Fs <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>), and a number of pin electronics or P/E channels <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Computer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> loads test programs and controls operation of other components of test system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Clock <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> generates system clocks and the test system period, which are provided to LVM <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, T/Fs <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and other pipeline circuits in the test system. LVM <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> stores and sequences test signals, commonly known as test vectors, used during the testing process. T/Fs <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> adjust the timing and formatting of various signals, i.e., data, strobe and input/output (I/O) control signals, received from LVM <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and couple the LVM to DUT <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, through PE channels <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. It should be noted that although test system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may include a single computer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, clock <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and LVM <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, it generally includes one T/F <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and an associated P/E channel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for each pin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> on a DUT <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, shown here as having pins <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through n. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> PE channels <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> typically include a PE driver <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> for applying a test vector, data, to a pin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of DUT <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a comparator <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> for comparing a DUT output signal with an expected output signal, and an error logic circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for coupling results of the comparison back to error processing circuitry and and an error capture memory (not shown). Generally, PE driver <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and comparator <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are not active in the same PE channels <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> at the same time, since pin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is either receiving data or control signals or transmitting a result at a given time. PE channels <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> further include a data line <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> for coupling the test vectors from T/F <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to PE driver <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and error logic <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, an enable or control line <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> for enabling the PE driver to apply the test vector to DUT <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and a strobe line <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> for enabling error logic <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> An example of part of a prior art memory test system for testing memory arrays in DUTs is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the test system <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> typically includes a computer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, a clock <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, an algorithmic pattern generator (APG <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>), T/Fs <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, and P/E channels <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. APG <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is used for generating a test signal or test vector for testing the memory array in the DUT. As above, it is to be noted that test system <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> further includes a single computer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, clock <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and APG <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, but a number of T/F <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> with associated P/E channel <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> for each pin on a DUT (not shown). For purposes of clarity, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates only three T/Fs <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and PE channels <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. PE channel <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and PE channel <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> differ from PE channel <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> because they merely provide address and clock signals to the DUT and therefore require only a PE driver <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. PE channel <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> both provides data to and receives data from a pin on the DUT, and therefore includes, in addition to PE driver <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, a comparator <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, an error logic circuit <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> that functions as described above. PE driver <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is coupled to T/F <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> by data line <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and control line <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Comparator <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and error logic <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are coupled to T/F <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> by strobe line <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and data line <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A fundamental problem with the above test systems <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is their inability to easily test in parallel DUTs having a combination of both logic circuits and memory arrays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Another problem with the above test systems <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, is their inability to switch the pattern source signal coupled to the pin at least twice in each DUT cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Yet another problem with the above test systems <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, is their difficulty in testing DUTs having serial data paths. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Still another problem with the memory test system <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> described above, is the inability to route any output from the APG <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to any PE channel <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and therefore to any pin on the DUT. For example, in a test system <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> designed to accommodate 64 pin ICs, outputs from an address T/F may be mapped to any one address of address pins one through twenty-four, while outputs from a data T/F would be mapped to data pins twenty-five through fifty-six, and outputs from a clock T/F are mapped to pins fifty-seven through sixty-four. Thus, it is difficult if not impossible to reconfigure the test system <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to accommodate DUTs having a different number of pins and/or arranged in a different configuration. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to an apparatus and method for high speed testing of integrated circuits (ICs) having either logic circuits, memory arrays or both. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In one aspect, the present invention is directed to an apparatus for testing a device under test (DUT). Generally, the apparatus includes: (i) a pattern generator having a number of outputs for outputting signals for testing the DUT; (ii) a number of pin electronics channels (P/Es) each coupling to one of a number of pins on the DUT; (iii) a number of timing and format circuits (T/Fs) for mapping signals to at least one of the P/Es; (iv) a pin scrambling circuit connected between the pattern generator and the T/Fs, the pin scrambling circuit capable of mapping at least two signals from any of the pattern generator outputs to any one of the T/Fs; and (v) a clock for providing a clock signal having a clock cycle to the pattern generator and the T/Fs. Preferably, the T/Fs are capable of switching the signals coupled to the P/Es at least twice in a clock cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the pattern generator includes logic vector memory (LVM) for testing logic circuits, and a memory signal source, such as an algorithmic pattern generator (APG), for testing memory arrays, and the scrambling circuit is capable of mapping signals from the LVM and the APG to separate T/Fs, thereby enabling the apparatus to simultaneously test one or more DUTs having logic circuits, memory arrays or both. Alternatively or additionally, the pattern generator can include a scan memory for serial type test interfaces or structural test. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the pin scrambling circuit is capable of sequentially coupling signals on a number of the pattern generator outputs, generated in parallel, to one of the P/Es to test a DUT having a serial input. In one version of this embodiment, the pin scrambling circuit is capable of simultaneously coupling a number of signals to other pins on the DUT to simultaneously test DUTs having both serial and parallel inputs, such as for example NAND flash memories. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, a number of the apparatuses are capable of being linked to form a test system that can test DUTs having a number of pins at least greater than the number of the P/Es on any one of the individual apparatuses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the present invention is directed to a method of testing a DUT using an apparatus having a clock, a pattern generator having a number of pattern generator outputs, and a number of pin electronics channels (P/Es). In the method, a clock signal having a clock cycle is provided using the clock, and signals for testing the DUT provided on the plurality of pattern generator outputs using the pattern generator. Each of a number of pins on the DUT are connected to one of the P/Es, and a signal from the plurality of pattern generator outputs coupled to at least one of the P/Es. The signal coupled to the P/E is switched at least twice each clock cycle, thereby providing an effective testing rate at least twice that of the clock cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the apparatus further includes a number of T/Fs each coupled between the pattern generator and one of the P/Es, and the step of coupling a signal to at least one of the P/Es involves coupling a signal from a T/F to at least one of the P/Es. In one version of this embodiment, the apparatus further includes a pin scrambling circuit connected between the pattern generator and the T/Fs, and the step of switching the signal coupled from the pattern generator outputs to the P/Es involves mapping at least two signals from of any of the pattern generator outputs to one of the T/Fs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the pattern generator includes logic vector memory (LVM) for testing logic circuits, and an algorithmic pattern generator (APG) for testing memory arrays. In this embodiment, the step of coupling a signal from the pattern generator outputs to the P/Es involves coupling signals from the LVM and the APG to separate or the same P/Es, thereby enabling simultaneous testing of one or more DUTs having both logic circuits, memory arrays or both. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In yet another embodiment, the step of coupling a signal to the P/E includes the step of sequentially coupling signals from pattern generator outputs to one of the P/Es to test a DUT having a serial input. In one version of this embodiment, signals are simultaneously coupled from a number of the pattern generator outputs to other pins on the DUT to test DUTs having both serial and parallel inputs, such as NAND flash memories. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The advantages of the present invention include: (i) the ability to couple any output on a pattern generator to any pin on a DUT, and to switch the signal coupled to the pin at least twice in each clock cycle; (ii) the ability to have a plurality of mappings selectable on a cycle-by-cycle basis; (iii) the ability to quickly and easily reconfigure the apparatus or test site to test one or more DUTs having logic circuits, memory arrays or both; (iv) the ability to quickly and easily reconfigure the test site to test one or more DUTs having serial data paths by serializing test signals generated in parallel using the pin scrambler and coupling them to any pin on a DUT; (v) the ability to quickly and easily reconfigure the test site to test DUTs having serial data paths, parallel data paths or both; (vi) the ability to quickly and easily reconfigure the test site to route serial scan memory to any pin or set of pins on a DUT, and change the routing at least twice in each clock cycle; (vii) the ability to quickly and easily reconfigure the test site to simultaneously test in parallel multiple DUTs each having a number of pins less than half the available P/E channels by mapping the same pattern generator outputs to multiple sets of P/E channels; and (viii) the ability to quickly and easily link multiple test sites to enable the testing of a DUT having a number of pins greater than the number of the P/Es available on any one or more of the individual test sites.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to a method and apparatus for high speed testing of integrated circuits (ICs) having either logic circuits, memory arrays or both. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> A test system according to the present invention will now be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a block diagram of a test system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> having a single apparatus or test site <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> for testing one or more devices under test (DUT <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>) according to an embodiment of the present invention. By DUT <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> it is meant any electronic component module or an IC having logic circuits, memory arrays or both. DUT <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> can be a die, packaged or can be one of a number of devices on a substrate.

While shown as having only one test site <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, it will be appreciated that test system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can include multiple test sites for parallel testing of a larger number of devices than can be accommodated on a single test site, or for testing a number of DUTs <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> with a larger number of pins <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> than available on one or more test sites. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, test system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes, in addition to test site <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, a general purpose host computer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> or PC. Host computer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> performs housekeeping functions such as downloading test programs to a test site computer <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> in test site <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, receiving results of device tests, and aiding in linking multiple test sites within a single test system, or linking multiple test systems (not shown) within a facility. Host computer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> can be connected via network connection <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> to other test sites (not shown in this figure) as described infra. Host computer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> can also be connected via an ethernet connection to a separate Local Area Network or a facility wide enterprise network <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> to track operation of test system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and/or results of device tests. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Generally, test site <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> includes, in addition to test site computer <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>, a clock <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>, a test signal source or pattern generator <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, a number of pin electronic (PE) circuits or channels <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, a number of timing generators and format circuits (T/Fs <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>), and a pin scrambling circuit <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> coupled between the pattern generator and the T/Fs. <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. The test site computer <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> is special purpose computer coupled to every other component or element in test site <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> for controlling the operation thereof. Clock <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> provides a timing or clock signal having a clock cycle to pattern generator <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and T/Fs <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. Pattern generator <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> includes a number of outputs (not shown in this figure) each having an output capable of outputting a distinct test signal for testing DUT <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. PE channels <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> couple the test signals, each including a drive/expect data signal, a strobe control signal and an Input/Output (I/O) control signal, to pins <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> on DUT <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. In accordance with the present invention, pin scrambling circuit <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> couples any one of the outputs of pattern generator <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> to any one of T/Fs <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, and through the T/F to any one of pins <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> on DUT <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Thus, test site <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> of the present invention enables the output or test signal coupled to a particular pin <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> on DUT <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to be switched or changed &ldquo;on the fly&rdquo; without rewiring of the test site, a connection to the DUT or extensive reprogramming of pattern generator <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. More preferably, pin scrambling circuit <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> couples at least two outputs to each T/F <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, thereby enabling the T/F to switch the output coupled to each pin <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> on DUT <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> at least twice in each clock cycle. </paragraph>

Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, pattern generator <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> includes a number of circuits or generators each with outputs <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> for outputting test signals for testing DUT <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, pattern generator <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> includes an algorithmic pattern generator (APG <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight>) for testing DUTs <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> that include a memory circuit or array, a scan memory <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> for testing DUTs that include a serial data path and a logic vector memory (LVM <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight>) for testing DUTs that include a logic circuit. APG <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> provides a test signal or test vector applied in parallel across a number of pins <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> on DUT <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> for testing a memory array. Scan memory <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> provides serial test signals for testing DUTs having inputs such as used during scan testing or structural testing. LVM <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> provides logic test vectors which include data to be written to a logic circuit of DUT <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and/or data to be read from the logic circuit. </paragraph>

Typically, each test signal comprises three or four distinct signals or bits. For example, a test signal can have three separate bits including a data bit, a strobe bit and an I/O control bit provided over three lines per tester cycle per pin <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> to scrambling circuit <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>. Scrambling circuit <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> can map at least two signals per cycle to each T/F <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In contrast, outputs <highlight><bold>187</bold></highlight> from LVM <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> provides six bits per pin <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> to scrambling circuit <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment shown six lines, or two bits, are mapped by scrambling circuit <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> to each T/F <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> including a first or primary bit and a second or double data rate DDR bit. In accordance with the present invention, T/Fs <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> can switch the bit applied to each pin <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> through an associated PE channel <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> at least twice in each clock cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Pin scrambling circuit <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> includes a number of pin scramblers <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, one for each T/F <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. Generally, pin scrambler includes switching elements or circuits, such as multiplexers, crossbar switches or switching fabric, and is capable of connecting any one of a predetermined number of inputs (outputs <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>187</bold></highlight>) to a predetermined number of outputs (T/Fs <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>).

Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, in one embodiment each pin scrambler <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> includes a number of multiplexers (MUXs <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>), for coupling drive/expect data, strobe control, and I/O control data to an associated T/F <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. Drive/expect data MUX <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight> comprises an 81-to-1 MUX with 2&times; RAM look-up for multiplexing, for example, 76 data lines from APG <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight>, 4 data lines from scan memory <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> and 2 from LVM <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> into a primary and a DDR bit for drive/expect data. The 2&times; RAM look-up includes one RAM for primary data bit MUX select and one RAM for DDR data bit MUX select. Strobe control MUX <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> comprises a 2&times; RAM look-up with an 43-to-1 MUX for multiplexing, for example, 38 strobe control lines from APG <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight>, 4 strobe control lines from scan memory <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> and 2 from LVM <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> to the primary and DDR strobe control bits applied to the associated T/F <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>.

T/F <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> receives from the pin scrambler <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> two complete test signals including a primary bit and a DDR bit. Each test signal includes a drive/expect data signal or bit, a strobe control signal or bit, and an I/O control signal or bit. In addition, T/F <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> also receives a six bit timing set select signal <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> from the pattern generator control logic to enable the T/F to determine which bit, the primary bit or the DDR bit, to couple to PE channel <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> during a particular portion of the clock cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the length or duration with which each bit is applied to PE channel <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> need not be equal, nor do the times of the transitions or switching of outputs <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>187</bold></highlight> need necessarily to correspond. T/F <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> also receives a clock signal <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> from clock <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> to enable the T/F to determine when to couple the primary bit or the DDR bit to PE channel <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>. Typically, clock signal <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> includes a number of regular clock ticks or pulses and, in conjunction with timing set select signal <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, inform T/F <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> how pulses constitute a tester cycle. For example, clock signal <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> can include pulses at a frequency of 100 MHz and T/F <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> can count 100 pulses to provide a 1 microsecond tester cycle. Thus, T/F <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> can switch the unformatted output coupled to associated PE channel <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> from 2 to about 20 times a tester cycle, provided sufficient bits are coupled to the T/F by pin scrambler <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> and timing set select signal <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> includes sufficient information to enable the T/F to determine which bit or output to couple to PE channel <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> during a particular portion of the clock cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, each PE channel typically includes PE driver <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> for coupling drive/expect data to a pin <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> of DUT <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, a comparator <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> for comparing an output signal with an expected output signal, and an error logic circuit <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> for coupling results of the comparison back to pattern generator <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and an error capture memory (not shown). Generally, PE driver <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and comparator <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> are not active in the same PE channel at the same time, since pin <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> is either receiving data or control signals or transmitting a result at a given time. PE channels <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> further include a data line <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight> for coupling the test vectors from T/F <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> to PE driver <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and error logic <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, an enable or control line <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> for enabling the PE driver to apply the test vector to DUT <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and a strobe line <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight> for enabling comparator <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, for a conventional test system operating at a single data rate, shown by graph <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> in the top of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, it is seen that a test signal or an output, DATA A is applied to a particular pin at the beginning of the clock cycle, T<highlight><subscript>zero</subscript></highlight>, and the same signal continues to be applied uninterrupted for the entire clock cycle. Although conventional test systems can apply test signals to different pins beginning at different times or at times interpolated between clock pulses or clock cycles, as indicated by graph <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight>, only one test signal or output can be coupled to a pin during a clock cycle. In contrast, for test system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and operating at a double data rate, shown in the lower half of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, it is seen from graph <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> that a first test signal or output, DATA A, can be coupled to pin <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> at T<highlight><subscript>zero </subscript></highlight>and a second signal or output, DATA B can be coupled to the pin at a later time before T<highlight><subscript>zero </subscript></highlight>of the next cycle.

<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, an exemplary setup for parallel testing of sixteen 4-pin serial memory devices using a 64-pin test site according to an embodiment of the present invention is shown. In this embodiment, a test signal from APG <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> is coupled through pin scrambling circuit <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> to T/Fs <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and PE channels <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> to pins <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> on the DUTs. An advantage of this setup is that an operator or test engineer need not write or duplicate a test program for each individual DUT <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. One added line of code per pin is sufficient for test site computer <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> to instruct pin scrambler <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> to apply the same test vector to each DUT <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
