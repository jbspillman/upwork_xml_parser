<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates in general to hydraulic couplings, and specifically to hydraulic couplings used in undersea drilling and production applications. More particularly, this invention involves a female hydraulic coupling member having recessed flow passages that facilitate connection to male coupling members. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Subsea hydraulic couplings are old in the art. The couplings generally consist of a male member and a female member with sealed fluid passageways connecting therebetween. The female member generally is a cylindrical body with a relatively large diameter longitudinal bore at one end and a relatively small diameter longitudinal bore at the other. The small bore facilitates connections to hydraulic lines, while the large bore seals and slidingly engages the male member of the coupling. The male member includes a cylindrical portion at one end having an outer diameter approximately equal to the diameter of the large bore of the female member of the coupling. The male member also includes a connection at its other end to facilitate connection to hydraulic lines. When the cylindrical portion of the male member is inserted into the large bore of the female member, according to various embodiments of the device, fluid flow is established between the male and female members. Couplings of this type are shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,694,859 to Robert E. Smith, III and other patents owned by National Coupling Company, Inc. of Stafford, Tex. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In undersea drilling and production applications, the male member of the coupling may be connected to a manifold plate or other securement at a subsea location at the inside or outside of a well bore. The female members, which also may be secured to a manifold plate, are moved into position over the male members and then lowered onto the male members by a diver or subsea vehicle. When the female members are positioned on the male members, hydraulic fluid flow typically is from the female member to the male member of each coupling. In some cases, only the female member of the coupling has a poppet valve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The poppet valve typically includes a conical valve face which seats, in the closed position, against a valve seat in the coupling member. The poppet valve opens to allow fluid flow, and closes against the valve seat within the bore to arrest the flow. Generally, the poppet valve is spring-biased to the closed position. The valve may include a valve actuator which may be a nose or stem extending from the apex of the valve face along the longitudinal axis of the poppet valve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In the couplings of U.S. Pat. No. 4,694,859, for example, hydraulic fluid flows longitudinally between the male and female coupling members. A number of different improvements and variations have been introduced in the configuration of flow ports and flow passages in couplings used for undersea applications. Some undersea hydraulic couplings are pressure balanced, for example, which may be achieved by hydraulic flow through aligned radial flow passages in the coupling members. The radial flow passages are generally perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the coupling, so hydraulic pressure tending to separate the coupling members is significantly reduced. In the male coupling members, radial passages typically extend from the central bore outward to the cylindrical outer surface of the probe. Examples of pressure balanced couplings are shown in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,754,780, 5,099,882, and 4,832,080 to Robert E. Smith III, assigned to National Coupling Company, Inc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Male undersea hydraulic coupling members also may include flow ports that are angled to prevent ingress of debris when the coupling members are disconnected. Frequently, well bores in which the couplings are positioned are full of debris. The male member, which remains subsea when the coupling is disconnected, is subject to debris accumulating in flow passages. The debris may contaminate the hydraulic fluid or cause wear to the seals and sealing surfaces in hydraulic couplings and hydraulic systems. To reduce or eliminate this problem, couplings such as those of U.S. Pat. No. 5,692,538 to Robert E. Smith, III have utilized angled flow ports that prevent ingress of debris into the hydraulic lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In the past, each of these male coupling members could be effectively connected only to certain female coupling members. For example, pressure balanced male coupling members with radial flow passages could only be connected to female coupling members having matching radial flow passages. Male coupling members with angled flow ports could be connected to conventional female coupling members configured for longitudinal flow of hydraulic fluid, but hydraulic flow between the angled flow passages, through the annulus between the male and female members, and the female member, was somewhat reduced. Accordingly, a female coupling member is needed to be connectable to a variety of different male coupling members without significant reduction in the flow of hydraulic fluid or other performance degradation. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The present invention resides in a female undersea hydraulic coupling member having recessed flow passages to facilitate flow of hydraulic fluid with male coupling members having flow passages that are either longitudinal, radial or angled. The recessed flow passages in the female coupling member allow interconnection with various different male member flow passage configurations without significant reduction in volume or flow rates. The recessed flow passages are machined in the body section of the female member.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, female coupling member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes body section <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> with a first end <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and second end <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. The second end of the female member may be threaded for attachment to a manifold plate. The female member has a central bore <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> from the first end to the second end thereof. Adjacent the first end of the female member is the receiving chamber <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. The female member typically includes one or more seals in the receiving chamber for engagement with the probe section of the male member. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, metal radial seal <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is held on shoulder <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> in the receiving chamber by seal retainer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> which is a sleeve-shaped member that is inserted into the receiving chamber. The seal retainer may have a stepped internal diameter <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> with an internal shoulder <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> between the steps. The seal retainer may be locked in the female member by lock ring <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> which has threads <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for engagement with mating threads of the female member. An additional seal, preferably elastomeric dovetail seal <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be included between the seal retainer and lock ring. Additionally, O-ring seal <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> can be used to seal the junction between the seal retainer and internal shoulder <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> in the female member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The second section <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the central bore is adjacent and inboard from shoulder <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. The second section <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the bore and the internal diameter <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of the seal retainer are dimensioned to allow sliding interfit with the probe section of a male coupling member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Valve bore <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is the section of the central bore adjacent the second end of the female member. The valve bore holds poppet valve <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. In the closed position, conical valve face <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> seals against valve seat <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Valve spring <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> urges the poppet valve into the closed position. Spring collar <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> anchors the valve spring, and is held in place by snap ring or clip <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The female member poppet valve slides within valve bore <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> in the female member. Extending from the apex of the conical valve face of the female member is valve actuator <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> which engages the corresponding valve actuator of the male member to urge the valves of both members into the open position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The recessed flow passages <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the present invention are in the central bore between the second section <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the valve bore <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. The recessed flow passages are dimensioned between {fraction (1/16)} and &frac14; inch greater in radius than the second section of the central bore. In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, the recessed flow passages form a single annular passage between the second section of the central bore and the valve bore of the female member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Now referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, male member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes first end or leading face <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> of probe <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The probe section terminates at flange <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Only the probe section of the male member enters the receiving chamber in the female member of the coupling, and the flange limits further entry of the male member into the receiving chamber. Flow passages <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may extend from the male member&apos;s internal bore to the outer circumference of the male member. The flow passages in the male coupling member may be radial or may be angled to prevent ingress of debris when the female member is disconnected and the male member remains subsea. Alternatively, the male coupling member may have longitudinal passages wherein the flow of hydraulic fluid is through the leading face. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The probe may have a stepped outer diameter, preferably first diameter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and second diameter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which is larger than the first diameter. The radial metal seal engages the first diameter of the male member and the elastomeric dovetail seal engages the second diameter. Shoulder <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> between the first and second diameters abuts shoulder <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> in the seal retainer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> When the male member is fully inserted into the female member, there is a gap <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> between the leading face <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> of the male member and internal shoulder <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. There also is a gap between the outer circumference of the probe and the internal diameter <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of the recessed flow passage section of the central bore. These gaps provide the recessed flow passages <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> which are the subject of this invention. Preferably, the gaps are between {fraction (1/16)} inch and &frac14; inch measured in radius. These gaps directly in front of and around the leading face of the male member are referred to and defined in this application as recessed flow passages <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the recessed flow passages form a single annulus between the leading face of the probe section and the female member bore. Alternatively, multiple recessed flow passages may be used. Each of the recessed flow passages extend between first internal shoulder <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and second internal shoulder <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the present invention provides a female undersea hydraulic coupling member having recessed flow passages to facilitate connection with male coupling members with various flow ports and flow passages. An advantage of the present invention is that it allows higher flow rates in couplings with radial or angled flow passages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Although variations in the embodiment of the present invention may not each realize all of the advantages of the invention, certain features may become more important than others in various applications of the device. The invention, accordingly, should be understood to be limited only by the scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
