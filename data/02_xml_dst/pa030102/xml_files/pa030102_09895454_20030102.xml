An output state depends on the magnitude difference of the differential input signal to the magnitude difference of the differential reference signal. If the magnitude difference of the differential input signal is below the magnitude difference of the differential reference signal, the output is in one state, but if the magnitude difference of the differential input signal is above the magnitude difference of the differential reference signal, the output is in the other state.

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE RELATED ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A comparator circuit is utilized for many applications. In general a comparator receives two inputs and generates an output based on the comparison of the two input signals. The comparison is typically looking at the amplitude or magnitude of the input voltages. A differential voltage magnitude comparator is a type of a comparator in which two differential input signals are provided to the comparator and a differential output is generated from the comparator. In one application one of the differential inputs is a reference signal. For example if the reference signal is a steady state voltage value the reference input then can be used to elevate the signal level of one of the other differential inputs for performing the comparison. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> For example, a differential comparator can be used to detect squelch (or unsquelch) for a receiver coupled to receive an input signal. For example, such a receiver can be coupled to a communication line or bus to discern when valid traffic is present on the line. When the traffic is sent over a single differential pair the presence of valid traffic is defined by the voltage difference between the pair of data lines comprising the differential pair. The state in which traffic is present is defined as the unsquelch state while the absence of traffic is defined as the squelch state. A comparator circuit can be used to identify the squelch/unsquelch states. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides for a differential voltage magnitude comparator in which one of the applications of the comparator of the present invention is to perform the squelch/unsquelch detection.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> graphical illustration <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of a function of an embodiment of a differential voltage magnitude comparator of the present invention is shown. In a voltage versus time representation, the upper portion of the graphical illustration <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> shows signal levels for two pairs of differential inputs. In the bottom portion of the graphical illustration <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, signal levels for the differential output pair from the comparator is illustrated. As noted, the example embodiment of the differential voltage magnitude comparator receives two differential input signal pairs and generates a differential output signal pair. The input signal pair are labeled DP and DM as one differential input signal and RP and RM define the second differential input to the comparator. In this particular embodiment, the RP and RM differential input are steady state voltage values used as a reference value. Also in the particular example, RP and RM are coupled to first set of differential input terminals. Likewise, DP and DM are coupled to second set of differential input terminals. Thus as shown, the RP and RM signals are utilized as reference voltages while the DP and DM signals indicate varying signal levels at the input. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The lower portion of the illustration shows the differential output pair, noted as OP and OM. The differential output OP/OM is dependent on the difference in the value between the DP and DM inputs. Whenever the differential voltage magnitude between DP and DM is greater than the differential between RP and RM, OP assumes a greater voltage than OM. However, whenever the differential voltage magnitude between DP and DM is less than the reference differential between RP and RM, OM assumes a greater voltage than OP. This relationship is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In the upper portion of the graph, the differential value between RM and RP is noted by arrow <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. Accordingly when the signals DP and DM are approximately the same value the output has OM higher than OP. When DP increases in amplitude, a point is reached when the difference in the amplitude between DP and DM equals the difference between RP and RM. As this point, which is shown by arrow <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, OP commences to become greater than the output OM. The output state transition again occurs when the DP/DM differential starts to become less than the RP/RM differential as shown by arrow <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> A similar transition of OP and OM occurs again when DM increases in amplitude where the differential between DM and DP is greater than RP and RM, as shown by arrow <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and the subsequent transition, as shown by arrow <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, when the DM/DP differential less than the RP/RM differential. Thus from the diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, it is to be noted that the output state is dependent on the differential voltage magnitude value between DP and DM. That is, OP is greater than OM whenever DP/DM (also DM/DP) differential magnitude is greater than the RP/RM differential. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> It is appreciated that the input voltage waveforms for the DP and DM signals are representative of signal states encountered on one type of differential set of data lines. The presence of valid traffic on the differential pair of lines is defined by the voltage difference between the line having the positive data (DP) and the line having the negative data (DM). That is, the voltage relationship between DP and DM signify two valid data states. However, when data is not present on the data lines, both DP and DM lines have a low voltage state. When positive data (one data state) is present, the DP line increases in magnitude while the DM line stays at the low state. Alternatively when negative data (second data state) is present, the DM line increases in voltage while the DP line remains at the lower voltage. Thus, in one application the presence of valid traffic is defined as DP and DM having an absolute voltage differential of at least 150 millivolts (mV) while the absence of traffic is defined as DP and DM having an absolute voltage differential of less than 100 mV. Accordingly a reference voltage (noted here in as RP/RM) can be established at some intermediate level to identify the switching point. In the example, approximately 125 mV is used to identify the switching point. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In one application, a detector coupled to the differential data pair will determine when there is data traffic on the data lines (unsquelch condition). That is, the state in which traffic is present is defined as the unsquelch state. A receiver is responsive to receive data in the unsquelch state. When traffic is absent on the data lines, this state is defined as the squelch state. As noted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the squelch and unsquelch states can be identified by the state of the OP and OM outputs. When OM is greater than OP a squelch condition is noted. However, when there is traffic on the line, OP will be greater than OM at the output. Thus, whenever OP is greater than OM, an unsquelch condition is noted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> If a receiver employing the detector performs the signal processing as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the presence of traffic is noted by the state of the OP/OM pair. When the unsquelch condition is noted, the detector can activate receiver circuitry in order to capture the data present on the data lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> A variety of embodiments can be implemented to achieve the differential voltage magnitude comparator to practice the present invention. One application of the magnitude comparator was noted in the waveform diagrams of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> wherein the output of the comparator has one state when the differential magnitude between DP/DM is below a reference value and the output takes on a second state when the differential value between DP/DM exceeds the reference value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, one circuit embodiment <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to obtain the desired output is shown. The input signals DP, DM, RP and RM, as well as the output signals OP and OM, are also noted as respective inputs and outputs for the circuit shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The example circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is comprised of two separate differential comparator circuits <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> in which their interim outputs, designated OP1 and OM1 for comparator <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and OP2 and OM2 for comparator <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, are coupled as differential inputs into a differential OR gate <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Circuit <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is comprised of two parallel portions or sections <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. Since these two sections are in parallel, they are functionally a single stage from a timing perspective. Section <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is comprised of two parallel branches, the first branch comprised of transistor <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> in series with a resistor <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. The second branch is comprised of a transistor <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> in series with a resistor <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. Although the circuit implementation is a design choice, in the particular example shown, transistors <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> are P-type metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) devices, hereinafter referred to as PMOS transistors. Thus, sources of transistors <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> are coupled together to VCC. In the example circuit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, a current source <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> is shown in the source branch to VCC to designate that a substantially constant current is sourced to transistors <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>. The gate of transistor <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> is coupled to receive one of the DP/DM differential pair. In this instance the signal DP is coupled to the gate of transistor <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>. The gate of transistor <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> is coupled to receive the other differential signal DM. The drain of transistor <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> is coupled to resistor <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> and to the interim output line OP1. The drain of the transistor <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> is coupled to the other differential output line OM1 as well as to resistor <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. The opposite terminal of the resistors <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> are coupled to the VCC return, which is noted as VSS in the example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The second section <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is also comprised of two parallel transistors <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. Transistors <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> are also PMOS transistors having their sources coupled together to VCC. Similarly, a current source <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> is shown to designate that a substantially constant current is sourced to transistors <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. The differential pair of transistors <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> are coupled to receive the other differential pair of signals, which in the example illustration of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a constant reference voltage. Signal RM is coupled to the gate of transistor <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> and signal RP is coupled to the gate of transistor <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. The drain of transistor <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> is coupled to the interim output OP1 and the drain of transistor <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> coupled to the interim output OM1. As noted in the drawing, resistors <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, are also coupled to the respective drains of transistors <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. In operation, the two sections <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, having common voltage dropping resistors <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, operate to provide voltage magnitude comparison only when DP is greater than DM by an amount greater than the reference value established by the differential of RP/RM. The interim outputs OP1 and OM1 are coupled to one set of differential inputs of the differential OR gate <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The second comparator <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> operates equivalently to the comparator <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. Therefore, PMOS transistors <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>, resistors <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> and current sources <highlight><bold>237</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> are coupled equivalently to respective components <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight>. However, in this instance, DM is coupled to the gate of transistor <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> while DP is coupled to the gate of transistor <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>. That is, the DP/DM connections are reversed from the circuit <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. The interim differential output lines are designated OP2 and OM2 for comparator <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. The differential output of the comparator in this instance will detect the case when DM is greater than DP by an amount greater than the differential of RP/RM. The interim outputs OP2/OM2 are then coupled as inputs to the second differential inputs of the differential OR gate <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. The differential output from the OR gate <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> are designated OP and OM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> When the circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is subjected to the input signal levels noted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the differential output from the OR gate <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> corresponds to the output waveform OP/OM also shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Thus, comparator <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> detects one portion of the unsquelched state when DP is greater than DM by the reference amount and comparator <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> detects the other portion of the unsquelched state when DM exceeds DP by the reference value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Although the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> provides the differential voltage magnitude comparison, two separate comparators <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and OR gate <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> are required to perform the function. The circuit embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> provides both comparisons as well as the ORing function in a single circuit stage. Accordingly the circuit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> performs the equivalent function of the circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> but within a single comparator stage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, circuit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> for performing a differential voltage magnitude comparison of DP and DM is shown. The circuit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is comprised of the DP/DM section <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and the RP/RM section <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. Section <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> is comprised of transistors <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>. In the particular circuit, transistors <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> are PMOS transistors. The differential outputs OP and OM are obtained by voltage drops across load resistors <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, respectively. Resistor <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> is disposed between the output OP (at node <highlight><bold>341</bold></highlight>) and VSS and resistor <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is disposed between the output OM (at node <highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight>) and VSS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In the circuit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, the transistors <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> are disposed into four branches of two transistors each. The transistors are in parallel between VCC and one or the other of the output lines OP/OM. A current source <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> is shown coupled between VCC and the transistor branches (at node <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>). The current source <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> depicts a substantially constant current, which is provided to the transistors. Transistors <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> are coupled in series between the current source <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> and the output line OP. Transistors <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> are coupled in series between the same two nodes <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>341</bold></highlight> to form the second branch of the circuit. Transistors <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> are coupled in series between the current source <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> and the output line OM to form the third branch, while transistors <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> are coupled in series between the same two nodes <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight> to form the forth branch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As noted, current source <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> is coupled to VCC while the opposite terminal of the resistors <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> are coupled to VSS. The DM and DP connections are made to the gates of the transistors <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> as shown in the diagram. Thus, DP is coupled to the gates of transistors <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>. DM is coupled to the transistors <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight>. The output OP is obtained at the node <highlight><bold>341</bold></highlight> of the drains of transistors <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> and resistor <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. The output OM is obtained at the node <highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight> of the drains of transistors <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> and resistor <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Likewise the RP/RM section <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> also comprises PMOS transistors <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> in the same arrangement as section <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. Similarly a current source <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is coupled to VCC to provide a substantially constant current to the four branches of the transistors <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> (at node <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>). The drains of transistors <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> are coupled to the output line OP as well as to the voltage dropping resistor <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. Likewise, the drains of transistors <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> are coupled to the output line OM, as well as to the voltage dropping resistor <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, as noted on the schematic diagram RP is coupled to the gates of transistors <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>327</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight>. RM is coupled to the gate transistors <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight>. As noted, the section <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> is utilized for processing DP/DM while section <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is utilized for providing the switching point reference voltage RP/RM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The circuit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> has an advantage in that a single circuit stage provides both comparator functions as well as the ORing function noted with the circuit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The first stage <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> functions to achieve two states. A first state is achieved when DP equals DM. In this instance, all eight transistors <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> have the same voltage on their gates. Thus, the current into node <highlight><bold>341</bold></highlight> is equal to the current into node <highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight>. As a result, OM equals OP. A second state is achieved when DP is not equal to DM, in which event, the respective gate voltages are not equal. As a result, one set of transistors (either <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>) provides a low impedance path for the current source <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>. However, at the same time, the other path set, comprised of transistors <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>, no longer provide a low impedance path. Therefore, more current flows through node <highlight><bold>341</bold></highlight> than through node <highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight>. The result is that the output OP is higher than OM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The second stage <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> provides the current offset to the stage <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> that is directly proportional to the differential magnitude of the RP/RM lines. Only the magnitude is of concern, since RP can be greater than RM or RM can be greater than RP. Because the stage <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is arranged similar to stage <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, it operates in a similar manner. With a difference in voltage between RP and RM, which is established by the reference voltage, stage <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> causes additional current flow to node <highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight>. With both stages <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> present, OP only overcomes OM when the current offset by stage <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> has been overcome by stage <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, which introduces a greater offset on node <highlight><bold>341</bold></highlight> over node <highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight>. This occurs when the differential voltage at the input of stage <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> is greater than the differential voltage at the input of stage <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The reason stage <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is implemented similar to stage <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> is that the voltage difference between RP/RM is amplified by the same amount as the difference between DP/DM. This allows for the trip point of the circuit to be set by the difference between RP and RM. No scaling is needed if the transistors are designed alike. That is, if the sixteen transistors <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> are of the same type and size, scaling is not needed. Additionally, process, voltage and temperature (PVT) variations are compensated, so the circuit will operate effectively over a wide range of PVT variations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> As noted, an advantage of circuit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is that the circuit is balanced and has symmetry. In design, all of the transistors <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> are substantially identical transistors. Both sections <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> have the same circuit arrangement of transistors. Furthermore, for each section, there are equal number of transistors in equal number of branches coupled to each of the output nodes. Each pair of input signals are also coupled in similar fashion in both section <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. Thus, transistors <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> receive the DP signal while transistors <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> receive the RM signal. Likewise transistors <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> are coupled to receive the DM input while transistors <highlight><bold>327</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> are coupled to receive the RP input. At the other portion of each circuit, transistors <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> are coupled to receive the DM and DP signals while transistors <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> are coupled to receive RM and RP signals. The DP and DM inputs are reversed with transistors <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> as are the RP and RM signals with transistors <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>. Thus, signal and circuit symmetry are achieved with balanced transistors of the circuit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> circuit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is shown. The circuit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is equivalent to the circuit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is shown but in this instance the resistors <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> are replaced by active components, in this example, transistors <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. As noted transistors <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> are NMOS transistors. A R<highlight><subscript>BIAS </subscript></highlight>signal is coupled to the gates of both transistors <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> in order to bias these two transistors as active resistive loads. Similarly transistor <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> is inserted for the current source <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> to provide an active component for maintaining the current and substantially constant. Likewise transistor <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> is inserted for the current source <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. Both transistors <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> are PMOS transistors. As noted an I<highlight><subscript>BIAS </subscript></highlight>signal is coupled to the gates of transistors <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> in order to bias these two transistors to provide the substantially constant current. It is noted that various other devices can be inserted in order to provide equivalent functions of resistors <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and sources <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> It is to be noted that the circuits <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> can be implemented in a variety of ways. For example, an NMOS equivalent circuit <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> to that of the PMOS transistor circuit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. Accordingly transistors <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight>, which correspond to transistors <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, are NMOS transistors. Likewise transistors <highlight><bold>521</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>528</bold></highlight>, which correspond to transistors <highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>428</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, are NMOS transistors. The N-P reversals are also done with the devices <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, such that transistors <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> are PMOS transistors, while transistors <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> are NMOS transistors. Due to the device reversal, the OP and OM output lines are also reversed, such that OM is coupled to transistor <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> while OP is coupled to transistor <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, it is to be noted that VCC is coupled to the transistors <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> and VSS is now coupled to the transistors <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>. The functional equivalence of the circuit <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is equivalent to that of circuit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The resulting functional block diagram <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> of the circuits <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> wherein a single stage differential voltage magnitude comparator <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> also provides the differential ORing function to provide the OP/OM output. If desired, differential to single ended conversion can be performed by use of an amplifier <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> to generate a single ended output corresponding to the state change of OP and OM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Although the differential voltage magnitude comparator of the present invention can be utilized in a variety of uses, one application utilizes the invention to provide a squelch detector. Thus, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7 a</cross-reference> detector <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight>, incorporating the differential voltage magnitude comparator of the present invention, is shown. The detector <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> is shown as part of a system <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>, although the detector <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> can be used in various other applications. In the example, the detector <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> is part of a controller <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>, which also includes a data receiver <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight>. As noted, the controller <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> is coupled to a differential set of data lines <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>. For example, differential pair <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> can be a Universal Serial Bus (USB), such as USB 2.0, so that the controller <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> is a USB compliant device. The two lines of the USB provide the DP/DM signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The controller <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> includes the detector <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> and a data receiver <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight>. The detector operates to activate the receiver to receive data when an unsquelch condition is detected on the data lines <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>. A reference voltage is shown coupled to the squelch detector to establish the state switching point. As was described in the earlier example, a 125 mV reference is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The receiver is activated when it receives the signal from the detector <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight>, indicating an unsquelch state. The data is received for by the controller <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> and transferred to other units. In the particular example system <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> shown, a processor <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> is coupled to the controller <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>. The data is transferred to the processor <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> for processing or handling. A memory <highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight> is also shown couple to the processor <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> to designate that the captured data can be stored in the memory <highlight><bold>771</bold></highlight> as well for later use. It is appreciated that the system <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> is shown in it&apos;s simplest form and that most computer systems have many more components other than what is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. Furthermore, the detector <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> can be included as part of the receiver <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight>. The present invention, including the matched differential pair circuit embodiments described herein, can be readily used in the squelch detector <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> to detect the state of the DP and DM lines in order to active the receiver for capturing data when ever data is present on the communication line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Additionally, it is to be noted that the examples above presented a substantially constant reference source for the RP/RM differential. However, the invention can be adapted to function with a variable RP/RM signal for those applications which may desire the use of having a variable reference magnitude for RP/RM. Furthermore, the invention can be adapted to use in an analog application to determine the difference between two analog lines regardless of polarity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Thus, a differential voltage magnitude comparator is described.
