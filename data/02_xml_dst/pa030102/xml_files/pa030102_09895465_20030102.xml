<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> As processor speeds increase, processor power dissipation also increases. With increasing processor power dissipation levels, the limit on the cooling capability within a notebook computer has almost been reached. When the internal cooling capability reaches its limit, the burden of cooling will have to shift to external cooling via a thermal port or docking station to enable the notebook computer to perform at peak performance in the stationary or docked mode with cooling assistance from the thermal port or docking station and at a reduced power level and reduced performance within the limits on the cooling capability of the notebook computer when standing alone.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Before beginning a detailed description of the subject invention, mention of the following is in order. When appropriate, like reference numerals and characters may be used to designate identical, corresponding, or similar components in differing drawing figures. Furthermore, in the detailed description to follow, example sizes/models/values/ranges may be given, although the present invention is not limited thereto. Where specific details have been set forth in order to describe example embodiments of the invention, it should be apparent to one skilled in the art that the invention can be practiced without, or with variations of, these specific details. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Although example embodiments of the present invention will be described using a notebook computer and a processor disposed therein, the present invention is not limited thereto but rather the present invention is applicable to any portable electronic device having a heat source contained therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, normally a processor <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> disposed within a notebook computer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is thermally coupled to a heat exchanger/internal fan <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> by a heat transfer device <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> which is normally a heat pipe. During normal operation, the heat pipe <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> transfers the heat dissipated by the processor <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to the heat exchanger/internal fan <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Since it is desirable to reduce the size and weight of the notebook computer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to a minimum, the size of the heat exchanger/internal fan <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is rather limited, thereby limiting the maximum allowable heat dissipation of the processor <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, in one illustrative example in accordance with the present invention, a second heat transfer device <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, which may also be a heat pipe, is thermally coupled between the processor <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and a second heat exchanger <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. The second heat exchanger <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is then thermally coupled to an external fan <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. Since this external fan <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is only used during the stationary or docked operation mode of the notebook computer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, it is not limited in size or weight as is the internal fan which is part of the heat exchanger/internal fan <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> disposed within the notebook computer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, this external fan <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, in concert with the second heat exchanger <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and second heat transfer device <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> can be used to remove a considerable amount of heat from the processor <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, to allow the processor <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to operate at maximum capability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In more detail, in accordance with another illustrative example, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the second heat exchanger <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> mates with the external fan <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> via a dove-tailed O-ring <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, for example, disposed within a docking station <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. Air holes are provided within the notebook computer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to allow air to flow into the notebook computer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and then flow through the second heat exchanger <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and then out an air opening <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> in the docking station <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, the air being moved by the external fan <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> within the docking station <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the airflow can be in the opposite direction, that is, the flow n be into the air opening <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and out the airholes. The heat exchanger/internal fan <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, disposed within the notebook computer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, may also be operated to provide additional cooling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The second heat exchanger <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> may be disposed close to the bottom skin of the notebook computer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> for easy mating with the dove-tailed O-ring <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and can be hidden away by a retractable cover when the notebook computer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is not in the docked mode, the retractable cover being similar to those used with docking connectors in present notebook computers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The air inlets or outlets for the notebook computer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be disposed on the front side of the notebook computer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> so that no connector space is compromised. Alternatively, the air inlets or outlets for the notebook computer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be disposed on the bottom of the notebook computer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and hidden away by another retractable cover so as to provide a large air intake opening or exhaust only during the docking mode of the notebook computer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> It is of course understood that the dove-tailed O-ring <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> is but one example of a seal which may be used to prevent air leakage between the second heat exchanger <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and the external fan <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, it may be possible to eliminate the use of a seal completely in some arrangements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> During the un-docked mode of operation, the heat pipe <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> transfers the heat dissipated by the processor <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to the heat exchanger/internal fan <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. During this time, the temperature of the second heat pipe <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and the second heat exchanger <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> rise up to the temperature of the heat pipe <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> but there is no heat being carried away from the second heat exchanger <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> However, in the docked mode of operation, the retractable cover hiding the second heat exchanger <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is retracted, allowing the second heat exchanger <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> to mate with the O-ring <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> disposed on the docking station <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. The mating is almost airtight and the O-ring <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> can be designed so that it compresses easily just by the weight of the notebook computer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, thereby eliminating a need for any extra force. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a graph illustrating the possible processor power is possible as a function of the second heat exchanger to air thermal resistance with the configuration illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. It is clear from this graph that it is possible to get a significant increase in cooling even at a high heat exchanger to air thermal resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Referring back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the external fan <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> does not have to be disposed within a docking station but rather may be a &ldquo;clip-on&rdquo; or &ldquo;snap-on&rdquo; fan which may be clipped or snapped onto the notebook computer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> when the notebook computer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is in a stationary mode in the same fashion as an AC adapter may be clipped or snapped onto the notebook computer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> when it is used in its stationary mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the power needed to drive this fan may be provided by the notebook computer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> via an electrical connector that engages a mating connector on the fan when clipped into the notebook computer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. This allows the processor <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> disposed within the notebook computer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to operate at its&apos; maximum capability when the notebook computer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is in its stationary mode of operation. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference> illustrate such an arrangement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In conclusion, the use of the present invention enables a significant gain in cooling potential as compared with earlier arrangements. The present invention allows a larger more powerful fan to be used to generate a significantly higher airflow which allows greater thermal transfer of heat generated by a heat source, e.g.&mdash;a processor, disposed within a portable electronic device, e.g.&mdash;a notebook computer. Furthermore, connector space is not compromised on the portable electronic device. Still furthermore, the use of a larger more powerful external fan allows the second heat exchanger to be relatively small, thereby minimizing the space requirements in the portable electronic device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> This concludes the description of the example embodiments. Although the present invention has been described with reference to a number of illustrative embodiments thereof, it should be understood that numerous other modifications and embodiments can be devised by those skilled in the art that will fall within the spirit and scope of the principles of this invention. More particularly, reasonable variations of modifications are possible in the component parts and/or arrangements of the subject combination arrangement within the scope of the foregoing disclosure, the drawings, and the appended claims without departing from the spirit of the invention. In addition to variations and modifications in the component parts and/or arrangements, alternative uses will also be apparent to those skilled in the art.</paragraph>
