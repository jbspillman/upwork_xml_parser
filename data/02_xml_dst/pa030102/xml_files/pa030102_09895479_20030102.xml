<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to communication of protection and control information between protective relays for an electric power system and more specifically concerns the transmission of data quantities between the protective relays over a limited bandwidth communication channel. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Protection and control schemes for electric power systems require communication channels for transmission of information concerning status and/or operation of the system between the protective relays for the power system. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, in a typical differential protection arrangement, there is an information exchange between the protective relays <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> associated with a given power line portion <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the power system followed by processing of the exchanged information. Fault determinations are made, including distinguishing external faults from internal faults relative to the power line portion associated with the two protective relays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The exchanged information includes analog and digital quantities. Analog to digital converters (ADCs) operate to convert selected analog quantities, i.e. those quantities obtained from the power line <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, to a digital format for data transmission from one relay to another over a selected communication line <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The conversion from analog to digital format is linear in that the digital output follows, in a linear fashion, the change in the analog quantity. Both resolution and dynamic range are important issues with respect to the conversion to a digital format. Most protective relays and the processing algorithms which they perform, such as for line current differential protection, require for proper operation high resolution over a relatively large analog range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A typical analog to digital converter used in protective relay arrangements has a 16-bit output. Typical commercially available communication channels have limited capacity, either 56 or 64 kilobits/second. Further, the protection algorithms are often run every {fraction (1/16)}<highlight><superscript>th </superscript></highlight>of a power system cycle for adequate power system protection and the entire protection information, in message format, is transmitted over the communication channel in real time, i.e. within {fraction (1/16)}th of a power system cycle. With a 56 k bps (bits per second) channel, and a power system frequency of 65 Hertz, 53 bits are available for the transmission of data every {fraction (1/16)}th power system cycle. The transmission bits needed include analog and digital data and security bits. The analog information to be transmitted requires 48 bits (16 bits&times;3 phases) out of the 53 bits available, leaving little room for status information, error detection, and correction bits, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A 12 bit output ADC could be used to provide additional channel space. However, this would degrade either the dynamic range or the resolution characteristic. Improvement in either the dynamic range or resolution to approximately that of the 16 bit ADC will cause a significant degradation in the other characteristic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Attempts have been made to resolve the desirability of transmitting additional information relative to the very real limitations on channel space. These solutions include the use of specialized communication lines, as opposed to commercially available lines, and/or transmitting individual analog channel information as a single analog quantity representing all three analog channels. These solutions, however, either add significantly to the expense of the overall system, or affect the quality of the protection for the power line. Sacrificing either resolution or dynamic range typically decreases the protection available to the power system to an unacceptable level. Heretofore, in the context of power line protection, data has been transmitted in a linear, uncompressed state, due to the understanding that compression of the data would have undesirable effects on the overall quality of power system protection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In applicant&apos;s disclosed system set out below, data compression is used to reduce the number of data bits to be transmitted, thereby providing additional bit capacity for other information to be transmitted by the transmitting relay. The present invention does not significantly affect either the dynamic range or the resolution of the transmitted data. The error rate, by careful selection of the data compression parameters, remains at an acceptably low level. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The present invention is a system for reducing the number of digital bits, representative of initial analog values, to be transmitted between protective relays in a power system, without significant loss of resolution or dynamic range. The system uses data compression, in accordance with a selected compression characteristic. The error produced as a result of the encoding/decoding is relatively small, and is maintained below the specified tolerance level for the selected power system protection scheme. The number of digital bits required to communicate the analog quantities over the communication channel is significantly reduced. In the embodiment described herein, logarithmic encoding is used to compress the linear digital data produced by the ADC (analog-to-digital converter). Other compression encoding methods could be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, the particular format of the digital data from the ADC will determine whether or not a sign bit is necessary for the compressed (encoded) data. If the data is unipolar (either all positive or all negative), no sign bit is necessary, but if it is bipolar, in which the digital data from the ADC has both positive and negative portions, a sign bit is used to distinguish positive values from negative values. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Typically, the output of an ADC in bipolar format will be in the form of a two&apos;s complement arrangement. Other formats, however, can be used. In two&apos;s complement format, a negative value is represented by only the most significant bit of the bit string being set to one, while the positive values are represented by ones, with the most significant bit being set to zero. Each analog value to be transmitted is represented first by a 16 bit output from the ADC (for a 16 bit ADC) and then by the number of bits produced by the compression algorithm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> An acceptable error level in the transmission of the data is initially determined. The amount of error is determined by the operating characteristics of the particular protection scheme. It is quite important that the data compression system operate within acceptable error limits of the protection and control scheme. In the present invention, the data compression algorithm is established such that errors are maintained within acceptable limits for the particular protection system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In the present data compression system, assuming a 16-bit ADC output with a bipolar two&apos;s complement format, one sign bit is required; this leaves 2<highlight><superscript>15 </superscript></highlight>or 32,768 different values possible to cover the magnitude of each analog value to be converted and transmitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In the following analysis, this total bit number (32,768 bits) which is the number of bits from a 16 bit ADC (minus the one sign bit), representing the analog quantity obtained by the protection system, is referred to as the max (maximum) linear value. The maximum error tolerable by the system is referred to as max error. The standard logarithmic compression equation for the maximum number of bits following compression is:</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>max linear value&equals;max error<highlight><superscript>maxlog</superscript></highlight>&emsp;&emsp;(equation no. 1).</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Using a base 10 log (log <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) and solving for max log, which is the number of digital data bits following compression used to represent the max linear value: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> max log&equals;log <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (max linear value) /log <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (max error) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> max log&equals;log <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (32,768)/log <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (1&plus;max error) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> max log&equals;log <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (32,768)/log <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (1.02), where 32,768 is the maximum linear value, i.e. the maximum number of linear data bits from the uncompressed output of the ADC and 0.02 (2%) is the maximum error tolerable by the particular protective system. Accordingly, max log&equals;4.154/0.0086 or max log&equals;525. Hence, the maximum compressed value (number of bits) required to represent the maximum linear value (32,768 bits) is 525. This value, 525, requires a total of 10 bits (2<highlight><superscript>10</superscript></highlight>&equals;1024) for full coverage. However, nine bits (2<highlight><superscript>9</superscript></highlight>)&equals;512 different values, which is quite close to 525, but still less than needed to fully represent the maximum linear value output of the ADC. Recalculating equation No. 1 using a max log of 512, and solving for maximum error, the maximum error increases only to 2.05%. Typically, such a slight increase in error would be acceptable to gain another bit space for other uses in the communication channel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Once the max log number has been obtained, the linear data from the ADC is encoded using conventional logarithmic compression. Each string of linear data (16 bits) from the ADC represents one analog value. The encoding is done in accordance with the following equation:</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>Encoded data&equals;log <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>(linear data)/log <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (1.0205)&emsp;&emsp;(equation no. 2)</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Encoded data&equals;log <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (linear data)/8.813&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;3</superscript></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Each encoded data string, representing one output string from the ADC and hence one analog value input to the ADC, is transmitted over the connecting communication line to the receiving protective relay. At the receiving protective relay the data is decoded in reverse fashion, using equation no. 2, solving instead for the linear data equivalent of each compressed data string. The original analog value may thereafter be obtained from the linear data string. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a flow chart for the system of the present invention. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, at the transmitting relay <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the 16 bit digital value equivalent of a particular analog value input from the power line <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> will first be obtained from the transmitting relay&apos;s ADC. This is shown at step <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. A determination is then made as to whether the value from the ADC is negative, as shown at step <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. If the answer is yes, i.e. the digital value is negative, then a sign bit portion of the encoded data is set to 1 (step <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>), while if the value is not negative, the sign bit is set to 0 (step <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>). The log value (encoded value) of the magnitude of the ADC value is obtained, as explained in detail above and shown at step <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, and the encoded (compressed) digital value is transmitted to the receiving relay <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, along with the sign bit (step <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>) over communication line <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The sign bit is transmitted first, followed by a succession of log bits. In the embodiment shown, the data (log bits) is transmitted from most significant bit to least significant bit with a total of 9 bits. This is also shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, with the bit stream including sign bit (SB) and log bits (LB) <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> With the present invention the communication channel can be a commercially available line, thus saving expense relative to a special line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> At the receiving end of communication line <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the receiving relay <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> will receive the transmitted sign bit, and the log (encoded) bits (step <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>). At step <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, it will first be determined whether the sign bit has been set (to one) or not, indicating a positive (step <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>) or negative (step <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>) polarity. The anti-log of the transmitted compressed data is then determined, providing the original linear data (step <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>), which is then used by the protection algorithm in the receiving protective relay <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to accomplish its protective functions (step <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Communication between the two relays <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is bi-directional over line <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, so that the original receiving relay can transmit data back to the original transmitting relay. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, a system and method has been disclosed for compressing and transmitting digital data between two associated protective relays for a power line portion of a power system. Control over the amount of the error caused by the encoding/decoding compression/decompression system is maintained. The data compression/decompression is an integral part of the protection and control system. In the one example of compression described herein, the encoding reduced the analog representation from 16 to 10 bits, a 37.5% reduction in required bandwidth. The invention thus enables sufficient data to be transmitted to provide a high level of protection for the power system while permitting a substantial amount of additional data to be transmitted, over a conventional communication line, while maintaining strict control over the error created by the encoding/decoding process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Although a preferred embodiment of the invention has been disclosed for illustration, it should be understood that various changes, modifications, and substitutions may be made in the preferred embodiment without departing from the spirit of the invention which is defined by the claims which follow;</paragraph>
