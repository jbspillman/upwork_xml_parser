<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A method that involves imposing different delays upon a received clock signal in order to generate a plurality of clocks. Then, providing a plurality of data streams by sampling a received data signal with each of the plurality clocks. The plurality of clocks each have a different phase position within an eye pattern of the received data signal as a result of the different imposed delays. The phase positions of the clocks are then moved into an opening of the eye pattern if differences in the plurality of data streams indicate one of the phase positions is not within the eye pattern opening. Various aparatti that perform the method are also described. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The field of invention relates to data signal processing generally; and more specifically, to compensating for the skew that exists between a clock signal and a data signal. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a pair of transmitting and receiving semiconductor chips (or units) <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> coupled together by a serial link <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> having a data signal line <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> and a clock signal line <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The transmitting unit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> sends a data signal <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> to the receiving unit <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> along data signal line <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. The receiving unit <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> uses a clock signal <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> that is sent along clock signal line <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to receive the data <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> That is, in the example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the receiving unit <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> clocks the data signal <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> on the rising edge of the clock signal <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The clock signal <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> may be referred to as a quadrature clock because the phase of its rising edges are 90 degrees away from the rising edges of the data signal <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> (using the data signal <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> as a phase reference). A link that transmits a clock along with data may be referred to as a source synchronous interface. Various source synchronous interfaces exist such as, for example, Low Voltage Differential Signalling (LVDS) and Serial Gigabit Media Independent Interface (SGMII). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A problem with serial links, particularly as their frequency of operation rises, is the presence of skew <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> between a data signal <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and a clock signal <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> when it is received at the receiving unit. Skew <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> is any phase relationship between the edges of the data signal <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and clock signal <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> other than the nominal or &ldquo;designed for&rdquo; phase relationship (such as 90 degrees, using the data signal <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> as a phase reference). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Skew may arise because the transfer function and/or trace length of the data signal line <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> is different than the transfer function and/or trace length of the clock signal line <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. For example if the data signal line <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> is shorter or has less capacitance than the clock signal line <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, the rising edges of the clock signal <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> can have more than 90 degrees of phase shift with respect to the rising edges of the data signal <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> For a given difference in transfer function and/or trace length between the data and clock signal lines <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, greater skew is observed between the data signal <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and clock signal <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> as the frequency of operation of the serial link <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> increases. That is, the differences between the signal lines <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> have an effect on the delay of the signals as they propagate from the transmitting unit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to the receiving unit <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. As the frequency of the serial link&apos;s operation rises, the delay represents a greater percentage of the data signal&apos;s pulse widths. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> As skew <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> increases the performance of the serial link degrades. That is, because the receiving unit <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> uses the clock signal to clock the reception of the data carried by the data signal <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, the &ldquo;misposition&rdquo; of the clock signal <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> edges causes the receiving unit <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to consistently clock incorrect data. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> An approach to eliminating skew involves, within a receiving device, comparing the data sampled from a plurality of clocks that have different phase positions with respect to one another. For example, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the phase positions <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of three clocks are shown. The phase position of a clock corresponds to the temporal location where data is sampled with the clock. For example, if data is sampled on the rising edge of a clock, the phase position of the clock corresponds to the temporal location of its rising edge(s). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the phase position <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of a first clock (the &ldquo;pre clock&rdquo;) precedes the phase position <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of a second clock (the &ldquo;clock&rdquo;) which precedes the phase position <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of a third clock (the &ldquo;post clock&rdquo;). The phase position <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the clock corresponds to the phase location where data is actually sampled by a receiving device for the purpose of understanding the data it is receiving. As such, in order to eliminate skew, the phase position <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the clock is properly positioned when it is approximately midway between the edge transistions <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the received data waveform eye pattern <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>(which may be referred to simply as an eye pattern). As is known in the art, the eye pattern of a data stream can be observed by continuously displaying the data stream over a temporal width that spans slightly beyond a full bit width (so that the waveform shapes of logical 1s and logical 0s can be fully observed). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Data is also sampled at the phase positions <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the pre clock and post clock. However, data is sampled at these phase positions <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>for the purpose of &ldquo;checking&rdquo; the accuracy of the phase position <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the clock. For example, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the phase position <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the clock is properly located. As such, the phase position <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the pre clock is located within an open portion of the eye pattern <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>between the left edges <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the eye pattern <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the phase position <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the clock (as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Similarly, the phase position <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the post clock is also located within an open portion of the eye pattern <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>between the right edges <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the eye pattern <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the phase position <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the clock (as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>)). As the phase positions <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of all three clocks are located within an open portion of the eye pattern <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the data samplings from all three clocks should be approximately the same (over time) when the phase position <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the clock is properly aligned (as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). That is, the data samplings from all three clocks should be accurate because samples are being taken, in all three cases, within an open portion of the eye pattern <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>demonstrates an instance (referred to as &ldquo;clock leading&rdquo;) in which the phase position <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the clock is ahead of its proper location. If the phase positions <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the three clocks are designed to preserve their temporal distance T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> from one another (regardless of their temporal positioning with respect to the eye pattern <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), a clock lead condition (as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) will cause the phase position <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the post clock to be located at or near a closed portion of the eye pattern (e.g., within the right edges <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the eye pattern <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Note that, in a clock lead condition, the phase positions <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the pre clock and clock remain in an open portion of the eye pattern <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. As such, the data samplings from the pre clock and the clock will be approximately the same (over time). That is, because the data samplings from the pre clock and clock are made within an open portion of the eye pattern <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, they should both be accurate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> However, the data samplings from the post clock, being made within a closed portion of the eye pattern <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, will be inaccurate. As such, the data samplings from the post clock will be noticeably different (over time) than the data samplings from both the pre clock and clock. A clock lead condition, therefore, may be recognized if the data samplings from the post clock are different than the pre clock and clock where the data samplings from the pre clock and clock are approximately the same (over time). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>demonstrates an instance (referred to as &ldquo;clock lagging&rdquo;) in which the phase position <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the clock is behind of its proper location. Again, if the phase positions <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the three clocks are designed to preserve their temporal distance T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> from one another, a clock lag condition (as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) will cause the phase position <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the pre clock to be located at or near a closed portion of the eye pattern (e.g., within the left edges <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the eye pattern <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Note that, in a clock lag condition, the phase positions <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the clock and post clock remain in an open portion of the eye pattern <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. As such, the data samplings from the clock and the post clock will be approximately the same (over time). That is, because the data samplings from the clock and post clock are made within an open portion of the eye pattern <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, they should both be accurate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> However, the data samplings from the pre clock, being made within a closed portion of the eye pattern <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, will be inaccurate. As such, the data samplings from the pre clock will be noticeably different than the data samplings from both the clock and the post clock. A clock lag condition, therefore, may be recognized if the data samplings from the pre clock are different than the clock and post clock where the data samplings from the clock and post clock are approximately the same (over time). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The recognition of clock lead or clock lag conditions, as described above, can be used to implement a stable feedback loop that continually drives the phase position <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the clock to be properly aligned. That is, once the phase position <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the clock is properly aligned, any subsequent &ldquo;drifting&rdquo; of the clock towards a lead or lag condition can be identified and used to drive the clock back to its proper position prior to any inaccurate data samplings from the clock. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows an exemplary methodology <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> of the operation of such a feedback loop. Data is sampled <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> from a pre clock, clock and post clock. If the data samplings from all three clocks is approximately the same (over time) <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, data continues to be sampled. However, a clock lag or clock lead condition may exist if the data samplings from all three clocks is not approximately the same (over time) <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Specifically, a clock lead condition exists if the data samplings from the pre clock and clock are approximately the same (over time) <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>. In response, the phase position of the clock may be moved backward <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> (with respect to its current position within the eye pattern). Similarly, a clock lag condition exists if the data samplings from the clock and post clock are approximately the same (over time) <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. In response, the phase position of the clock may be moved forward <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> (with respect to its current position within the eye pattern). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> If the data samplings from two clocks are not approximately the same (over time) <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> then the phase position of the clock is aligned with a closed portion of the eye pattern (e.g. at the left edges <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>or right edges <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) or a signal quality problem exists. If the clock is aligned in a closed portion of the eye pattern, the phase position of the clock may be moved forward or backward to correct the alignment problem. In an embodiment, the phase position is automatically moved (forward or backward) approximately half a bit width so as to &ldquo;jump start&rdquo; the phase position of the clock at approximately the proper location). In an alternate embodiment, no such &ldquo;jump start&rdquo; is implemented and the phase position migrates to the proper position naturally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows an embodiment of a circuit design <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> that can operate according to the methodology <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> described above with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. In the approach of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, clock signal line <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> may be viewed as corresponding to clock signal line <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and data signal line <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> may be viewed as corresponding to data signal line <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. As such, the circuitry <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> may be viewed as being within a receiving unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Data output <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> corresponds to the data being sent to the receiving unit (as determined by the circuitry <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). The circuitry <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, as described in more detail below, generates three clocks: 1) a pre clock which appears on pre clk signal line <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>; 2) a clock which appears on clk signal line <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>; and 3) a post clock which appears on post clk signal line <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>. As such, the circuitry <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is devoted to maintaining the phase positions of the signals on the pre clk, clk and post clk lines <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> to correspond to the properly aligned phase positions <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>originally shown back in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The multiphase clock generator <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> generates the trio of clocks from the clock signal received from the link on clock signal line <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>. Note that the clock signal received on the clock signal line <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> may be phase shifted by the phase shifter <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> in accordance with the phase position adjustment strategy described in more detail below. The trio of clocks (pre clk, clk and post clk) are generated from the clock signal received on clock signal line <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> (as shifted by phase shifter <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> if any phase shift is appropriate) by the multiphase clock generator <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment, the multiphase clock generator <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> applies three different, fixed phase delays to the clock signal provided by phase shifter <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight>. For example, the trio of clocks may be generated by: 1) directly passing the phase shifter <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> output clock without a phase delay upon pre clk signal line <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> to form the pre clk signal; 2) passing the phase shifter <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> output clock with a phase delay of T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> upon clk signal line <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> to form the clk signal; and 3) passing the phase shifter <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> output clock with a phase delay of 2T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> upon post clk signal line <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> to form the post clk signal. The T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and 2T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> phase delays may be imposed in any of a variety of ways such as passing the clk signal through a gate or buffer having a propagation delay of T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and passing the post clk signal through a pair of gates or buffers that each posses a propagation delay of 2T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The above design approach will provide the trio of clocks with a phase position difference of T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with respect to one another as observed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Note that the amount of phase delay T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may vary from embodiment to embodiment. That is, for example, the phase position spacing T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may be tailored in light of the expected, worst case or &ldquo;designed for&rdquo; eye pattern signal quality. A poorer quality eye pattern corresponds to a smaller eye opening. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> For example, referring briefly to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the eye pattern <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>quality will degrade as the left and right signal transitions <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>move closer together while the bit width remains the same. For example, as the slope angles of the signal transistions decrease (noting that exemplary slope angles <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> are shown for right signal transistions <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), for a fixed bit width, the signal transistions <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>begin to move closer together which corresponds to the signal transistions consuming a greater portion of the eye pattern. This, in turn, corresponds to a reduced eye opening which may be viewed as a poorer quality eye pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> As such, if a poor quality eye pattern is expected or designed for (e.g., as a worst case condition or otherwise), the phase position spacing T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the trio of clocks may be reduced. That is, recall that: 1) the phase positions <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of all three clocks should provide for accurate data recovery when the clk signal is properly aligned (as observed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>); and 2) a phase lag or lead position is identified when the phase position of one of the &ldquo;outer&rdquo; clocks (i.e., the pre clock or post clock) begins to result in different, inaccurate data recovery (as compared to the remaining clocks). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Thus, under poor quality eye pattern environments, the phase position spacing T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may be designed to be small to ensure proper data recovery for all three clocks when the clk signal is properly aligned. Typically, poor quality eye patterns are associated with high speed data links because the speed of the data link begins to approach the maximum bandwidth offered by the signal lines. As such, as the speed of the data link increases, the phase positions of the three clocks may be designed closer together. Alternatively, the phase position of the clock may be allowed to &ldquo;dither&rdquo; back and forth within the open portion of the eye (which will still produce correctly interpreted data) in response to the pair of &ldquo;outer&rdquo; clocks being alternately positioned too close to the edges of the eye opening. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> A multiphase data sampler <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> samples the data received on data signal line <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> (as phase shifted by phase shifter <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> if any such phase shift is appropriate as described in more detail below) at the phase position of each of the three clocks provided by the multiphase clock generator <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>. As such, three streams of sampled data (pre data, data, and post data) are provided to a phase adjust unit <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The pre data stream, which is provided on signal line <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight>, corresponds to the data samplings performed with the pre clk signal provided on the pre clk signal line <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>. The data stream, which is provided on signal line <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight>, corresponds to the data samplings performed with the clk signal provided on the clk signal line <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. The post data stream, which is provided on signal line <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight>, corresponds to the data samplings performed with the post clk signal provided on the post olk signal line <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, the phase position of the pre clk, clk and post clk corresponds to the temporal location where data is sampled. Data is typically sampled against a threshold such as threshold <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. For example, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, if data is sampled on a rising edge of a clock, the phase position of the clock&apos;s rising edge corresponds to the temporal location where an inquiry is made as to whether or not the data signal is above the threshold <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>or below the threshold <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Typically, if the data signal is above the threshold <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>the data is interpreted as a &ldquo;1&rdquo;; or, if the data signal is below the threshold <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>the data is interpreted as a &ldquo;0&rdquo;. Note that the data samplings from the data stream signal line <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> can be interpreted as the &ldquo;main&rdquo; or &ldquo;primary&rdquo; interpretation of the data being received. As such, as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, signal line <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> corresponds to the circuitry <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> output. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> A phase adjust unit <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> determines whether a phase adjustment of the trio of clocks is appropriate. As described above, the data samplings from the three streams of data (pre data, data and post data) may be compared with one another. If they are the same, no phase adjustment needs to be made. If the pre data stream and data stream are the same but the post data stream is different, a clock lead condition exists and the phase position of the trio of clocks may be effectively adjusted &ldquo;backward&rdquo; with respect to their position with the eye pattern opening. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> If the data stream and post data stream are the same but the pre data stream is different, a clock lag condition exists and the phase position of the trio of clocks may be effectively adjusted &ldquo;forward&rdquo; with respect to their position with the eye pattern opening. The phase position of the trio of clocks may be effectively adjusted &ldquo;backward&rdquo; with respect to their position within the eye pattern by either imposing more delay with the clock signal phase shifter <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> or by imposing less delay with the data signal phase shifter <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> (or a combination of both). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The phase position of the trio of clocks may be effectively adjusted &ldquo;forward&rdquo; with respect to their position within the eye pattern by either imposing less delay with the clock signal phase shifter <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> or by imposing more delay with the data signal phase shifter <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> (or a combination of both). The phase adjust unit <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> can make these phase adjustments by controlling the clock phase adjust <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> (to set the delay imposed by the clock signal phase shifter <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight>) and/or the data phase adjust <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> (to set the delay imposed by the data signal phase shifter <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>). Note that both a clock signal phase shifter <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> and a data signal phase shifter <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> are not necessarily required. That is, appropriate phase adjustments may still be made even if only a clock signal phase shifter <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> is implemented or if only a data signal phase shifter <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> is implemented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The phase shifters <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> may be implemented in any of a number of ways. In many applications, the delay imposed by each a phase shifter <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> is proportional to the voltage level on its corresponding adjust line <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>. For example if the voltage swing on an adjust line <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> is configured to be between V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (at a minimum) and V<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (at a maximum), the clock signal phase shifter <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> may be designed to have a nominal delay of X (e.g., as measured in pico seconds) for an adjust line voltage of (V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&plus;V<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>)/2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> If the adjust line <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> voltage drops below (V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&plus;V<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>)/2, the corresponding delay imposed by the phase shifter <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> falls below X; and, correspondingly, if the adjust line <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> voltage rises above (V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&plus;V<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>)/2, the corresponding delay imposed by the phase shifter <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> rises above X. In one embodiment, the phase clock signal shifter <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> (and/or data signal phase shifter <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>) is implemented as series of buffers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> If the adjust line voltage <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> is (V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&plus;V<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>)/2), the nominal delay is imposed by tapping the phase shifter <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> output from a central buffer. If the adjust line voltage <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> falls below (V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&plus;V<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>)/2 the phase shifter <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> output is taken from a buffer that precedes the central buffer in the series; and, if the adjust line voltage <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> rises above (V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&plus;V<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>)/2 the phase shifter <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> output is taken from a buffer that follows the central buffer in the series. In an alternative embodiment, the phase shifters <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> increase or decrease a capacitance in order to implement the appropriate phase shift. In another alternative embodiment, the phase adjust unit <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> output adjust lines <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> are digital words that the phase shifters <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> respond to. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows an embodiment of a phase adjust unit <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> that may be used for the phase adjust unit <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The phase update logic <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> monitors the pre data, data and post data streams that are respectively provided on signal lines <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>517</bold></highlight>. Consistent with the methodology described above, the phase update logic <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> triggers an appropriate phase shift (or shifts) in the clock signal phase shifter <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> and/or the data signal phase shifter <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the appropriate voltage on the adjust lines <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight> may be developed by running a stream of current pulses (via pump <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> line <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> for clock adjust line <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> and pump <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> line <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> for data adjust line <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight>) into a corresponding filter <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. For example, if it is appropriate to impose more delay through the clock phase shifter, the voltage on the clock phase adjust line <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> may be raised by running a stream of positive current pulses (via pump <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> line <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>) through filter <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, if it is appropriate to impose less delay through the clock phase shifter, the voltage on the clock phase adjust line <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> may be lowered by running a stream of negative current pulses (via pump line <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>) through filter <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The voltage on the data phase adjust line <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight> may be similarly adjusted. The use of the filters <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, b </italic></highlight>helps &ldquo;smooth&rdquo; the feedback response. That is, gradual adjustments are made to the phase position of the trio of clocks rather than chaotically &ldquo;jumping&rdquo; from phase position to position to phase position in response to disimilarities in the data. Note that a digital approach may be used instead of the analog approach as described just above. That is, a digital word may be presented at the output of the phase update logic unit <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> (and the output of filters <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, b</italic></highlight>) such that filters <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, b </italic></highlight>are implemented as digital filters rather than analog filters (e.g., as an accumulator circuit with feedback). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The phase update logic <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> may compare the pre data, data and post data streams in any of a number of different ways. For example, in one approach, a different first-in-first-out (FIFO) queue is used to individually receive each data stream (e.g., a pre data FIFO, a data FIFO and a post data FIFO). The data collected in each queue is compared against one another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Based upon the similarity of the data patterns within the queues, the phase adjust unit <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> can determine whether or not a phase adjustment is appropriate (e.g., if a clock lead or a clock lag condition exists). In a further embodiment, comparisons of each queue with respect to another are made via correlation (which is a mathematical technique that measures the likeness of two data patterns). Is still other embodiments, comparisons may be made (with or without the use of queues) by comparing a running average of the data streams. A number of comparisons may be made before a decision is reached. As such, it is clearly deemed, over time, whether or not the data streams are approximately the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> It is important to point out that an &ldquo;identical&rdquo; comparison of the data streams need not exist in order to determine that the phase position of the cik signal is properly aligned. That is, a designer may allow for modest differences between the various data streams before phase adjustments are deemed appropriate. As such, the present teachings apply to techniques where less than &ldquo;identical&rdquo; data comparisons are sufficient for considering the phase positions of the trio of clocks to be acceptable (e.g., &ldquo;substantially the same&rdquo;). The degree as to which dissimilarities are deemed allowable may be tailored according to designer preference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> It is also important to note that embodiments that employ other than a trio of clocks are possible as well. For example, as just one possible alternative approach, five clocks may be configured (e.g., a pre pre clk, a pre clk, a clk, post clk, and a post post clk) where each of the five clocks posses a phase position spacing of T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> from a neighboring clock. An even number of clocks is also possible. For example, out of four clocks, one of the &ldquo;inner&rdquo; clocks (i.e., the 2<highlight><superscript>nd </superscript></highlight>or 3<highlight><superscript>rd </superscript></highlight>clock) may be chosen for actual data sampling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Note that the approach of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> may be implemented in an &ldquo;on the fly&rdquo; fashion in which live data is actually transported over the link while, simultaneously, streams of data are being compared and adjustments to the clock phase positions are being made. In an alternate approach, a &ldquo;setup&rdquo; mode is implemented rather than an &ldquo;on the fly&rdquo; mode. That is, the proper phase position of the clocks is established by the circuitry <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> prior to the transportation of actual (e.g., &ldquo;customer&rdquo;) data over the serial link. This approach may be viewed as a form of calibration (e.g., to eliminate skew problems implemented by the layout of signal traces between the transmitting and receiving devices of the link). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Note also that embodiments of the present description may be implemented not only within a semiconductor chip but also within machine readable media. For example, the designs discussed above may be stored upon and/or embedded within machine readable media associated with a design tool used for designing semiconductor devices. Examples include a netlist formatted in the VHSIC Hardware Description Language (VHDL) language, Verilog language or SPICE language. Some netlist examples include: a behaviorial level netlist, a register transfer level (RTL) netlist, a gate level netlist and a transistor level netlist. Machine readable media also include media having layout information such as a GDS-II file. Furthermore, netlist files or other machine readable media for semiconductor chip design may be used in a simulation environment to perform the methods of the teachings described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Thus, it is also to be understood that embodiments of this invention may be used as or to support a software program executed upon some form of processing core (such as the CPU of a computer) or otherwise implemented or realized upon or within a machine readable medium. A machine readable medium includes any mechanism for storing or transmitting information in a form readable by a machine (e.g., a computer). For example, a machine readable medium includes read only memory (ROM); random access memory (RAM); magnetic disk storage media; optical storage media; flash memory devices; electrical, optical, acoustical or other form of propagated signals (e.g., carrier waves, infrared signals, digital signals, etc.); etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In the foregoing specification, the invention has been described with reference to specific exemplary embodiments thereof. It will, however, be evident that various modifications and changes may be made thereto without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. The specification and drawings are, accordingly, to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense. </paragraph>
