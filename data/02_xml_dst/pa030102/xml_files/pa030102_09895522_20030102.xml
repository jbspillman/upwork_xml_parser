<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method for making semiconductor devices, particularly those that include copper interconnect pads that have aluminum caps. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> One way to connect a semiconductor die to the device&apos;s package is to wirebond an interconnect pad, which is located on the die, to the package. When copper is used to make such an interconnect pad, the copper may oxidize if exposed. Consequently, to make a copper containing interconnect pad, an aluminum cap may be formed on the copper to protect it from oxidation. The wirebond is then made to the aluminum cap. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The conventional process for forming an aluminum cap on a copper containing interconnect pad includes the following steps. Copper is deposited onto a dielectric layer to fill a trench that has been formed in that layer. The copper is then polished to remove it from the surface of the dielectric layer to generate a structure in which the surface of the remaining copper is substantially flush with the surface of the dielectric layer. Aluminum is deposited onto the surface of the copper and the adjoining dielectric layer. Next, a lithography and etch process is used to remove the aluminum from the dielectric layer&mdash;retaining it on top of the copper only. After conventional post etch photoresist ash and clean steps, a passivation layer is formed on top of the resulting structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The conventional process for forming aluminum caps on copper containing interconnect pads is relatively expensive and complex. In addition, because the structure, which this process creates, includes aluminum caps that rise above the surface of the dielectric layer, relatively narrow gaps may separate adjacent caps. It may be difficult to fill those gaps with the passivation layer that is deposited over the aluminum caps and the dielectric layer. To fill them, the passivation layer may have to be deposited using a high density plasma process. That layer may then have to be planarized. This adds still more complexity to the process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, there is a need for a relatively inexpensive and less complex process for making a semiconductor device that includes aluminum capped copper interconnect pads. There is also a need for such a process that generates an aluminum capped structure in which the surface of the cap is substantially flush with the surface of the adjacent dielectric layer. The present invention provides such a process.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A method for making a semiconductor device is described. In that method, dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is formed on barrier layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, which has been formed on substrate <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Via <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and trench <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are then formed in dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> using conventional lithography and etch techniques. The resulting structure is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Substrate <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be any surface, generated when making a semiconductor device, upon which a dielectric layer may be formed. Substrate <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> thus may include, for example, active and passive devices that are formed on a silicon wafer such as transistors, capacitors, resistors, diffused junctions, gate electrodes, local interconnects, etc . . . . Substrate <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> also may include one or more conductive layers that are separated from each other, or from such active and passive devices, by one or more dielectric layers. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, substrate <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> comprises a structure upon which may be formed a dual damascene interconnect that provides an interconnect pad for the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Barrier layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> will serve to prevent an unacceptable amount of copper from diffusing into dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, and may also serve as an etch stop. Barrier layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> preferably comprises a refractory material, such as tantalum, tantalum nitride or titanium nitride. Particularly preferred is a two layer stack that includes an underlying tantalum nitride layer upon which is formed a tantalum layer. When comprising such a two layer stack, a conventional physical vapor deposition (&ldquo;PVD&rdquo;) process may be used to form barrier layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Barrier layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> should be thick enough to perform its diffusion inhibition and etch stop functions, e.g., being between about 10 and about 50 nanometers thick. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> may comprise any material that may insulate one conductive layer from another. Preferred are insulating materials with a dielectric constant that is lower than the dielectric constant of silicon dioxide, e.g., porous oxide; carbon or fluorine doped oxide; organic containing silicon oxides; or various polymers. A particularly preferred material for making dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is a fluorosilicate glass (&ldquo;FSG&rdquo;), which may be deposited onto substrate <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> using a conventional high density plasma (&ldquo;HDP&rdquo;) process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> may alternatively comprise an organic polymer. Such organic polymers include, for example, polyimides, parylenes, polyarylethers, organo-silicones, polynaphthalenes, and polyquinolines, or copolymers thereof. Commercially available polymers sold by Honeywell, Inc., under the trade name FLARE&trade;, and by the Dow Chemical Company, under the trade name SiLK&trade;, may be used to form dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. When dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> comprises a polymer, it is preferably formed by spin coating the polymer onto the surface of substrate <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> using conventional equipment and process steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> may also be made from a compound having the molecular structure Si<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>R<highlight><subscript>z</subscript></highlight>, in which R may be hydrogen, carbon, an aliphatic hydrocarbon or an aromatic hydrocarbon. When &ldquo;R&rdquo; is an alkyl or aryl group, the resulting composition is often referred to as carbon-doped oxide. When dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> comprises a carbon-doped oxide, dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> preferably includes between about 5 and about 50 atom % carbon. More preferably, such a compound includes about 15 atom % carbon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Examples of other types of materials that may be used to form dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> include aerogel, xerogel, and spin-on-glass (&ldquo;SOG&rdquo;). In addition, dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> may comprise either hydrogen silsesquioxane (&ldquo;HSQ&rdquo;), methyl silsesquioxane (&ldquo;MSQ&rdquo;), or other materials having the molecular structure specified above, which may be coated onto the surface of a semiconductor wafer using a conventional spin coating process. Although spin coating may be a preferred way to form layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> for some materials, for others a plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (&ldquo;PECVD&rdquo;) process may be preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> After via <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and trench <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are formed, they are lined with barrier layer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Barrier layer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> will serve to prevent an unacceptable amount of copper from diffusing into dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. Barrier layer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, like barrier layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, preferably comprises a refractory material, such as tantalum, tantalum nitride or titanium nitride. Also like barrier layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, particularly preferred is a two layer tantalum nitride, tantalum stack, formed using a conventional PVD process. Barrier layer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> should be thick enough to perform its diffusion inhibition function, e.g., being between about 10 and about 50 nanometers thick. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> After lining via <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and trench <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> with barrier layer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, via <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and trench <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are filled with copper, when forming copper layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. This generates the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Copper layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> may be formed using a conventional copper electroplating process. Such a process typically comprises depositing a barrier layer (e.g., barrier layer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) followed by depositing a seed material (e.g., one made of copper), then performing a copper electroplating process to produce the copper layer, as is well known to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In a typical process, after copper layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is deposited, it is polished, e.g, by applying a chemical mechanical polishing (&ldquo;CMP&rdquo;) step, until its surface is substantially flush with (or recessed slightly below) the surface of dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. (That polishing step may be followed by a standard cleaning step.) In, however, the process of the present invention, a significantly greater amount of copper layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is removed, without simultaneously removing significant amounts of dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, to form a relatively highly recessed copper plug within layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> There are many ways to remove additional amounts of copper layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> without removing a substantial portion of dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. For example, an electropolish process may be applied to generate a recessed copper plug. Such a process will generally require that electrical contact be maintained to copper layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment described here, electrical contact may be maintained with copper layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> because layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is formed on a dissimilar, relatively thin, conductive layer that lines the trench&mdash;i.e., barrier layer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The electropolish process itself is well known to those skilled in the art, consisting essentially of contacting the surface to be polished with an appropriate solution chemistry, then applying an electrical potential to that surface. See, e.g., R. Contolini, A. Bernhardt, and S. Mayer, <highlight><italic>Electrochemical Planarization for Multilevel Metallization</italic></highlight>, J. Electrochem. Soc., Vol. 141, No. 9, pp. 2503-2510 (September 1994). Such a process may enable the controlled, selective removal of copper from the surface of a copper layer. In one example, portions of a copper layer may be removed by exposing that layer&apos;s surface to a phosphoric acid containing solution, then applying an electrical potential of between about 1 and about 1.5V (with respect to a copper reference electrode) for a period of time sufficient to remove the desired amount of copper from the copper layer. The electrical potential may be applied in a steady state fashion, or alternatively, in a dynamic fashion&mdash;e.g., by using pulsed plating. Preferably, current density is maintained between about 15 and about 20 mA/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment of the present invention, copper layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> must be recessed sufficiently deep into dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to ensure that a subsequently deposited aluminum layer will maintain a sufficient thickness to serve as an aluminum capping layer that protects the underlying copper from oxidation, even after the aluminum layer has been polished and cleaned. In a preferred embodiment, copper layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is polished until its upper surface is separated from the surface of dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> by at least about 50 nanometers, and more preferably by at least about 200 nanometers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> A relatively highly recessed copper plug may instead be formed by adjusting the parameters applied during the CMP process, such as by enhancing the chemical etch contribution to the polishing process near the end of that treatment. A standard cleaning step may follow such a modified polishing step. Such a recessed copper plug may also be formed by applying a selective wet etch process (which follows a conventional CMP polish and clean sequence) to etch the copper at a significantly faster rate than it etches dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. Removing a portion of copper layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> (along with the adjacent part of barrier layer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>), without simultaneously removing a significant portion of dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, produces the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, which includes recessed copper plug <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> After forming recessed copper plug <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, barrier layer <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is formed on its surface. Barrier layer <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> preferably comprises a titanium nitride layer. Barrier layer <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> may be deposited over dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and copper plug <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> using a conventional PVD process. Layer <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> preferably should be deposited at a thickness of between about 10 and about 50 nanometers. Although in this embodiment, layer <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> comprises a titanium nitride layer, additional layers (or layers made from other materials, e.g., tantalum nitride, tantalum, or titanium) may be used instead without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Next, aluminum layer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is deposited onto barrier layer <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, filling the recess located above copper plug <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and covering dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. Aluminum layer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> may be deposited using a conventional PVD process, or alternatively using a process that is performed at an increased temperature to facilitate the filling of the recess. The resulting structure is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>. Although not done in this embodiment of the present invention, layers of titanium nitride, titanium, tantalum nitride, tantalum, or other materials may be formed on top of aluminum layer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Next, the portions of aluminum layer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and barrier layer <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> that cover dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> are removed. In a preferred embodiment, those portions are removed using a conventional CMP step. Optimally, at the end of that CMP step, the surface of the remaining portions of aluminum layer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is substantially flush with the surface of dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. A cleaning step may follow that CMP step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> After removing layers <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> from dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, the resulting structure includes an aluminum capping layer <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>, which is formed on copper plug <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>. Aluminum capping layer <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> will serve to inhibit oxidation of the underlying copper plug <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. To perform that function, aluminum capping layer <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> preferably is between about 50 and about 200 nanometers thick. The optimal thickness will, of course, depend upon the thickness required to provide this protective function for a particular application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> After forming aluminum capping layer <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>, passivation layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is formed on its surface, and the surface of dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>. Passivation layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be made in the conventional manner using conventional materials, e.g., silicon nitride, silicon dioxide, polyimide or another type of polymer. Conventional processing may follow to provide a wirebond contact to aluminum capping layer <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The method of the present invention enables an aluminum capping layer to be formed on top of a copper interconnect pad in a self-aligned manner, and without having to apply a lithography, etch, photoresist ash, and post etch clean sequence, which adds complexity and expense. In addition, the method of the present invention generates a structure in which the surface of aluminum capping layer <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> is substantially flush with the surface of dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. Because the resulting topology does not have narrow gaps between aluminum caps, relatively complex process steps, which may be required to fill those gaps, are unnecessary. Moreover, that flat surface means the passivation layer will not require planarization and may enable that layer&apos;s thickness to be reduced. The process of the present invention thus enables aluminum caps to be formed on copper containing interconnect pads in a relatively simple and inexpensive manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Features shown in the above referenced drawings are not intended to be drawn to scale, nor are they intended to be shown in precise positional relationship. Additional steps that may be included in the above described method have been omitted as they are not useful to describe aspects of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Although the foregoing description has specified certain steps, materials, and equipment that may be used in such a method to make a semiconductor device, those skilled in the art will appreciate that many modifications and substitutions may be made. Accordingly, it is intended that all such modifications, alterations, substitutions and additions be considered to fall within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. </paragraph>
