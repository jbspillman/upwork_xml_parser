<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method of testing radiation. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method of testing radiation for a SDRAM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In the field of space technology, electronic devices that are utilized in space have to be tested with an anti-radiation test. In wireless satellite transmissions, for example, the electronic devices used for satellite communications have to pass a radiation test. Those devices have to have high resistance to radiation and good readability for use in space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The radiation test for a synchronized dynamic random access memory (SDRAM) is very important, because the SDRAM is an important device for transmitting data. There are various methods that can detect the damage of a SDRAM and its reliability during the radiation process. In general, in a single event upset (SEU) method, when the SDRAM is radiated, the written status of the SDRAM will change. However, when the status of the SDRAM is rewritten, the SDRAM can still function. In a single event latchup (SEL) method, after the SDRAM is radiated, the SDRAM cannot function. However, when the SDRAM is restarted, the SDRAM can function again. Micro latch-up and get rapture tests are more reliable tests used to test the SDRAM and can obtain more details about the tested device. The micro latch-up test detects the location of a non-functional region in the SDRAM after the SDRAM has been radiated and tested, but the SDRAM does not have to restart its program. The get rapture test can indicate whether the SDRAM is permanently damaged after the radiation test. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> With the increasing improvement of semiconductor technology and the demand of higher speeds for computers, there has been gradual development in the memory capacity of the SDRAM device. However, a SDRAM is still a newly developed device, so currently there is no literature regarding how a SDRAM will be affected under a radiation test. Therefore, the condition of a SDRAM that is subjected to the radiation test is still unknown. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide a method of testing radiation for a synchronized dynamic random access memory (SDRAM). The method comprises performing the SEU, the micro latch-up, the SEL and the get rapture tests on the SDRAM. Thus, the condition of the SDRAM after the radiation test can be determined, and the reliability of the SDRAM can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the present invention to provide a method of testing radiation for a SDRAM. The method comprises performing a self-test by a test device to ensure that all the test devices are functioning properly. A &lsquo;start&rsquo; signal is transmitted from an irradiation controller to an irradiation room, and periodic radiation is produced continuously. Each cycle of the periodic radiation consists of on/off regions. The test device checks whether the SDRAM is in an off region. If no radiation is detected on the SDRAM, a test pattern is then written from the test device to the SDRAM. The readings obtained from the SDRAM are calculated to obtain a difference sum. When the SDRAM is in an on region, wherein radiation is detected on the SDRAM, the test device checks if there is an abnormal current present in the SDRAM. If there is an abnormal current present in the SDRAM, the test device goes back to its self-test step. However, if there is no abnormal current present in the SDRAM, the test device checks whether the SDRAM is in an off region. Once the SDRAM is in the off region, a test pattern is written from the test device to the SDRAM. Readings, which are obtained from the SDRAM before and after the test, are calculated, and a difference sum of these readings is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The test device checks whether a &lsquo;stop&rsquo; signal is sent out by the radiation controller, if the radiation controller dose not send out the &lsquo;stop&rsquo; signal, the test process goes back to the step of writing a test pattern from the test device to the SDRAM, and the readings, which are obtained from the SDRAM before and after the test are calculated, wherein a difference sum of these readings is obtained. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates a flow chart of a method of testing for radiation for a synchronized dynamic random access memory (SDRAM). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates a schematic view of a radiation test of the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> show a method of testing for radiation for a SDRAM. A radiation test is carried out to produce radiation in an irradiation room <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> by an irradiation controller <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> in a control room <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. The irradiation controller <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> of the control room <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> radiates to a SDRAM <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> located in a test table <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> of the irradiation room <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. A test device <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is connected to the SDRAM <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> in order to determine the status of the SDRAM <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the test device <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> performs a self-test S<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> before starting a radiation test in order to ensure that the test equipment functions properly to test for radiation on the SDRAM <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. If the test equipment functions properly, a start signal is transmitted from the irradiation controller <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> to the control room <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> to start the radiation test. The irradiation controller <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> produces periodic radiation continuously in the irradiation room <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates a graph of the periodic cycles of radiation. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> cycle (i) comprises a first region, a second region and a third region. The first region is the region where no radiation is produced during this period in the irradiation room <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> (S<highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>). The second region is the region where radiation is produced in the irradiation room <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> during that period. The third region of cycle (i) is the region where no radiation is produced during this period in the irradiation room <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</cross-reference>, a step S<highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> determines whether there is radiation produced in the irradiation room <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. If the test device detects radiation, a step S<highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> will follow, in which the irradiation controller <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> will record the readings from the irradiation room <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. If the test device does not detect any radiation, the test device waits until the SDRAM is irradiated and then continues to step S<highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. At step S<highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, an efficient algorithm for the SDRAM is calculated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In an example test of the present invention, a test is set up in a hexadecimal pattern of P&equals;0x5555, Q&equals;0xaaaa (the hexadecimal pattern also can be set up with P&equals;0xaaaa, Q&equals;0x5555). The example test with the hexadecimal pattern is written from the test device <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> to the SDRAM <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, so that readings from the SDRAM <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> can be recorded and calculated.

Based on the same principle, FpSTKO(i) indicates that P&equals;0x5555 is written into the SDRAM <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, wherein the SDRAM <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is originally &ldquo;0&rdquo;. The test writes &ldquo;1&rdquo; into the SDRAM <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. However, a reading obtained from the SDRAM <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is &ldquo;0&rdquo;. On the other hand, F<highlight><subscript>q </subscript></highlight>STK<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>(i) indicates that Q&equals;0xaaaa is written into the SDRAM <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, wherein the SDRAM <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is originally &ldquo;1&rdquo;. The test writes &ldquo;0&rdquo; into the SDRAM <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, but a reading obtained from the SDRAM <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is still &ldquo;1&rdquo;.

The test writes &ldquo;1&rdquo; into the SDRAM <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, but a reading obtained from the SDRAM <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is still &ldquo;0&rdquo;. STK<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>(i) indicates that the assumptive test pattern P and Q are both written into the SDRAM <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, which has an original reading &ldquo;1&rdquo;. However, &ldquo;0&rdquo; is written into the SDRAM <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> during the test, and the final reading obtained from the SDRAM <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is still &ldquo;1&rdquo;. The same principle is applied to STK<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>(i), which indicates that assumptive test patterns P and Q are both written into the SDRAM <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, which has an original reading &ldquo;0&rdquo;. However, &ldquo;1&rdquo; is written into the SDRAM <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> during the test, and the final reading obtained from the SDRAM <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is still &ldquo;0&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In the first region of the periodic cycles of the radiation, the test is written from the test device <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> to the SDRAM <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, and test readings are obtained from the SDRAM <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. These readings obtained from the SDRAM <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> provide information about the status of the SDRAM <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> before and after the radiation. According to the readings, any change of the SDRAM status during the radiation can be detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the test device detects if there is radiation present. If there is radiation present, the SDRAM <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> will be at the second region shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. During the period of the second region, a step S<highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is carried out to check if any abnormal current has been transmitted from the test device <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> to the SDRAM <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> &lsqb;a single event latch-up (SEL) status occurs&rsqb;. If there is abnormal current in the SDRAM <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, the process will return to step S<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. However, a predetermined amount is set by the get rapture test to set how many times SEL can occur. If SEL occurs over the predetermined amount, then the SDRAM <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is regarded as permanently damaged. The test device <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> will then transmit a &lsquo;stop&rdquo; signal to inform the irradiation controller <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> to end the radiation test. However, if there is no abnormal current in the SDRAM <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, the process will be at the third region of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, which is also at step S<highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>

The test device <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> reads the test readings from the SDRAM <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> after it has been radiated.

<claim id="CLM-00001">
<claim-text><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. A method of irradiating a synchronized dynamic random access memory (SDRAM) by a test device, wherein a status of the SDRAM after a radiation test is determined and calculated, the steps of the method comprising: 
<claim-text>performing a self-test on the test device after starting; </claim-text>
<claim-text>waiting for a &lsquo;start&rsquo; signal from an irradiation controller, the irradiation controller continuously producing periodic radiation, wherein each cycle of the periodic radiation includes on/off regions; </claim-text>
<claim-text>checking whether the SDRAM is in an off region, wherein no radiation is radiated on the SDRAM, and a test pattern is written from the test device to the SDRAM; </claim-text>
<claim-text>calculating readings obtained from the SDRAM, and obtaining a difference of the readings; </claim-text>
<claim-text>checking whether the SDRAM is in an on region, wherein radiation is radiated on the SDRAM, and checking if there is an abnormal current present in the SDRAM, wherein: 
<claim-text>if there is an abnormal current present in the SDRAM, the test device goes back to the self-test step; </claim-text>
<claim-text>if there is no abnormal current present in the SDRAM, checking whether the SDRAM is in an off region; </claim-text>
</claim-text>
<claim-text>ensuring the SDRAM is in the off region, wherein no radiation is radiated on the SDRAM, and a test pattern is written from the test device to the SDRAM; </claim-text>
<claim-text>calculating the readings which are obtained from the SDRAM before and after the test, and obtaining a difference of these readings; </claim-text>
<claim-text>checking whether a &lsquo;stop&rsquo; signal is transmitted from the irradiation controller; and </claim-text>
<claim-text>when the irradiation controller does not send out a &lsquo;stop&rsquo; signal, returning to the step of writing a test pattern from the test device to the SDRAM, and calculating the readings which are obtained from the SDRAM before and after the test, and obtaining a difference of these readings. </claim-text>
</claim-text>
</claim>
<claim id="CLM-00002">
<claim-text><highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The method of <dependent-claim-reference depends_on="CLM-00001">claim 1</dependent-claim-reference>, wherein the test patterns transmitted from the test device to the SDRAM are two sets of complementary readings, and each difference of the periodic radiation of the SDRAM are accumulated to obtain a sum, but if the accumulated sum of the differences causes the abnormal current present in the SDRAM, the test device returns to the self-test step. </claim-text>
</claim>
<claim id="CLM-00003">
<claim-text><highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The method of <dependent-claim-reference depends_on="CLM-00001">claim 1</dependent-claim-reference>, wherein when the SDRAM is in the on region, if an abnormal current is present in the SDRAM, then the test device first records the SDRAM as damaged, but when the damaged number reaches a predetermined number of a get rapture test, then the SDRAM is regarded as permanently damaged, and the test device informs the irradiation controller to end the radiation test. </claim-text>
</claim>
<claim id="CLM-00004">
<claim-text><highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The method of <dependent-claim-reference depends_on="CLM-00001">claim 1</dependent-claim-reference>, wherein the difference sum calculated from the SDRAM before and after the radiation test are complementary readings, and each difference of the periodic radiation of the SDRAM before and after the radiation test is accumulated, and if the accumulated sum of the differences is greater than a threshold value, the test device returns to the self-test step.</claim-text>
