<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method for forming an insulating layer with low dielectric constant. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method for forming an insulating layer with foamed structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In order to satisfy the requirement of interconnect after the size of metal-oxide semiconductor transistor is greatly reduced, the interconnect structure designed with multiple metal layers has been the usual way in integrated circuit. Particularly, for a powerful microprocessor, it usually needs four, five, or even more metal layers, so as to accomplish the interconnect structure. This kind of multilevel interconnect needs several insulating layers between for insulating the metal layers, preventing short circuit in the multilevel interconnect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The spin-on glass (SOG) process is one of conventional methods to form an insulating layer. The SOG process includes a dielectric material which is solved in a solvent as a solution. The solution with dielectric material is coated over a wafer by a pin coating manner, and then the wafer is put on a hot plate for baking, so as to cure the SOG, while the solvent in the solution is evaporated away. After the first stage of curing on the hot plate, the wafer is transferred into a furnace for the final stage of curing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> However, as the size of interconnect is further reduced following fabrication trend, the back-end of line is narrowed, causing a phenomenon of metal line delay. The metal line delay is a severe issue in operation of integrated circuit. This is because when the line width of interconnect is getting narrow, the parasitic capacity is getting more effect and further causing time delay, and even more causing power consumption resulting in raising temperature on the wafer. In this consideration, it is strongly desired that the insulating layer needs smaller dielectric constant. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The invention provides a method to form an insulating layer with foamed structure, so that the dielectric constant is further reduced. Therefore, it is suitable for use in the more and more complicate device design. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The invention provides a method for forming an insulating layer with a foamed structure. The method uses a subcritical drying process to form the insulating layer with foamed structure. The method includes coating a gel layer over a substrate, where the gel layer includes several types of solution, an unextractable material, and a solvent. A subcritical drying process is performed to extract a to-be-extracted material in the gel layer, so that the gel layer is transformed into the insulating layer with the foamed structure. The foamed structure can reduce the dielectric constant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the subcritical dry mechanism is related to the control between temperature and pressure, so that some extractable materials exited in the polymer gel can be extracted leaving pores, whereby the unextractable material forms a layer with foamed structure, also called porous structure. The temperature and the pressure are set at the critical levels in the three-phase diagram for the extracted material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Since the invention has employed the subcritical drying process to form the insulating layer with foamed structure, the dielectric constant further lower than that of the conventional low dielectric constant insulating layer. Since the invention uses the subcritical drying process to form the foamed structure, the dimension of each pore un the foamed structure is more uniform. This also allows the electrical transmission between device to be more efficient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary, and are intended to provide further explanation of the invention as claimed.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a fabrication flow for preparing a gel material used for forming an insulating layer with foamed structure, according to a preferred embodiment of the invention. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> solution <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and an unextractable material <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> are mixed. The solution <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> includes, for example, teraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), ethanol, deionized water, and catalyst. The catalyst can include, for example, a mixed solution of hydrofluoric acid or hydrochloric acid. The unextractable material <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> includes, for example, silicon oxide or germanium oxide. The solution <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is then further added with a solvent <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. As a result a gel material <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is formed. The solvent <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> includes, for example, ethyl alcohol, iso-butanol, 2-pentanol, or 2,2,4-trimethylpentane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a fabrication flow for forming an insulating layer with foamed structure, according to a preferred embodiment of the invention, according to the preferred embodiment of this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the processing for forming a low dielectric constant insulating layer with foamed structure includes a step <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of forming a gel material by mixing a solution, an unextractable material and a solvent. The solvent is used to solve the unextractable material in the solution. Then, the gel material is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> in the step <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, the gel material is coated over a substrate to form a gel layer, where the substrate may have a device already formed thereon. Then, the substrate with the gel layer is put in a closed pressure chamber. The closed chamber includes, for example, pressure chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> in the step of <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, the closed chamber is heated up to a subcritical temperature with respect to the material to be extracted. The subcritical temperature is determined according to the three-phase diagram. As a result, the material to be extracted in the gel layer is vaporized into vapor phase. The heating rate on the closed chamber is, for example, 2&deg; C. to 60&deg; C. per hour, where 2&deg; C. to 10&deg; C. per hour is preferred. Since the material to be extracted has turned into vapor phase for extraction, the pressure level in the closed chamber is also at the subcritical pressure. At this moment, the gel layer coated on the substrate becomes a layer having foamed structure. The gel layer with pores serves as an insulating layer that has further lower dielectric constant that that of the conventional low dielectric constant material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In the step of <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, the vapor in the closed chamber is flushed away, where the temperature in the closed chamber preferably is kept at a constant temperature. The constant temperature is not necessary to be the subcritical temperature. Furthermore, the pressure level in the closed chamber is gradually reducing up the environmental pressure during removing the vapor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In the step of <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, the closed chamber is cleaned by, for example, flushing inert gas for at least 1 minute. The inert gas includes, for example, nitrogen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In step of <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, the substrate is cooled to the zoom temperature, and is taken out from the closed chamber. According to the above process flow, to form the foamed structure, the liquid material to be extracted is smoothly and slowly vaporized out due to the temperature is set at the subcritical temperature. Therefore, the pores of the foamed structure are formed with a uniform dimension with narrow variation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In summary, the invention has several advantages as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> 1. The invention uses the subcritical drying process to form the insulating layer with foamed structure. Since the insulating layer has pores, the dielectric constant is further reduced, comparing with the conventional method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> 2. The invention uses the subcritical drying process to form the insulating layer with foamed structure. The dimension of pores in the insulating layer is more uniform with narrow variation. This gives a better electrical transmitting efficiency between devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made to the structure of the present invention without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention. In view of the foregoing, it is intended that the present invention covers modifications and variations of this invention provided they fall within the scope of the following claims and their equivalents. </paragraph>
