<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a testing architecture for a semiconductor memory device. More particularly, the present invention relates to a testing architecture for a semiconductor memory device with serial data outputs. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A semiconductor memory device with serial data outputs, for example, an electrically erasable programmable ROM (EPROM) broadly used in computer and electronic industry, is commonly tested after the memory device is finished to check whether the memory device performs an expected function or manifests a malfunction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Currently, several kinds of semiconductor memory devices are available with multifunction to reach the requirement of the device tests. However, some devices which need high level tests are expensive. This causes a lot of capital expenditure. Therefore, a high testing performance and low cost testing architecture using a personal computer has been developed. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference>, a personal computer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is connected with a buffer and a serial-to-parallel converter to form a testing architecture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The testing architecture <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> comprises a serial-input-parallel-output (SIPO) device <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, a buffer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> (such as a memory of a personal computer), and a tester <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> (such the CPU and display of a personal computer). While activating the testing architecture <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, a starting clock signal with 8 clocks is in sequence output from the tester <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and is transmitted to a device under test (DUT) <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the SIPO <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> through line <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> (here a clock signal with 8 clocks is taken as an example). At this time, according to the data stored in the DUT <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the s clock starting signal, a storing signal with 8 clocks is output in series from the DUT <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and is transmitted to the SIPO <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> through line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The serial storing signal with 8 clocks is converted into a parallel signal by the SIPO <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Then the parallel signal is output to the buffer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> through bus <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Before the tester <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> starts testing, a stop signal is transmitted to the DUT <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> through line <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> to stop transmitting data to the SIPO <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. This is called a hardware time delay. The time delay can benefit the testing process. An access signal output from the tester <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is transmitted to the buffer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> through line <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. The 8 bits of data stored in the buffer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is transmitted to the tester <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> through bus <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The 8 bits of data transmitted to the tester <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is tested and compared by the tester <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. The data is result sorted and then output to be checked by the operators. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In order to describe the testing architecture in detail, reference is made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A, 2B</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>B. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> is a timing sequence of the start signal output through the testing architecture in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference> is a testing flow chart of the testing architecture. In step S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the start clock signal is transmitted in sequence to the DUT <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the SIPO <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> by the tester to drive the DUT <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to transmit the data in series to the SIPO <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The corresponding time interval is t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>. In time interval t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of step S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, 8 bits of the serial starting clock signal is converted into a parallel signal, and then the parallel signal is transmitted to the buffer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. In step S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, that is, in corresponding time interval t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A, a</cross-reference> stop signal is transmitted from the tester <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> to the DUT <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to stop relaying the data to the SIPO <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. This is a kind of hardware time delay. The time delay can benefit the testing process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, that is, in corresponding time interval t<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, an access signal is transmitted from the tester <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> to the buffer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The parallel form 8 bits of data stored in the buffer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> are transmitted to the tester <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. In S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the 8 bits of data are tested, compared, and result sorted by the tester <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. A testing result is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Using the testing architecture in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>B, after the data stored in the DUT <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is accessed, the serial-to-parallel operation, the buffer driving operation to access the data, and the delay time added for avoiding data overflow are performed. This causes an increase in testing time. Moreover, if the CPU of the personal computer is used to access, compare, and result sort the data, the testing architecture causes a waste of time with regard to the temporal non-availability of the CPU. Thus, it takes a lot of time to finish the device tests, and the capital expenditure is increased. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Reference will now be made in detail to the present preferred embodiments of the invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers are used in the drawings and the description to refer to the same or like parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a block diagram for a testing architecture <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of a semiconductor memory device according to one preferred embodiment of this invention. The testing architecture <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> comprises a microprocessor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, as well as a result sorting and display device <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. The microprocessor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is used to receive a serial data output from a semiconductor memory device (called a device under test). When the serial data is received by the microprocessor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, the data is tested and compared. The microprocessor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> includes, for example, an 8051 integrated circuit (IC) having a fast 10 calculation function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> While starting to test a device under test (DUT) <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a start signal is output by the result sorting and display device <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, and then transmitted to the microprocessor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> through line <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. A clock signal is output from the microprocessor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> to the DUT <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through line <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. When the clock signal is received by the DUT <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, stored data is output. In general, if 8 bits of data are tested, signals with 8 clocks are transmitted in sequence from the microprocessor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. Here, the 8 clock signals are just an example. Different bits of data can be tested by the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> While the microprocessor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> receives data, for example, 8 bits of data, transmitted from the DUT <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the data is tested and compared by the microprocessor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. A testing result signal is obtained by the microprocessor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, and then transmitted to the result sorting and display device <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> through line <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. When the testing result signal is received by the result sorting and display device <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, the testing result signal is sorted and a result is displayed so that the operators can distinguish whether the DUT <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is correct. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In order to describe the preferred embodiment of the invention in detail, please refer to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A, 4B</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> is a timing sequence of the clocks output from the microprocessor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> is a testing flow chart of the preferred embodiment of the invention. In step S<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the test-starting signal is output from the result sorting and display device <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> to the microprocessor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. In time interval t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A, the clocks &num;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, &num;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, &num;<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> . . . are output in sequence from the microprocessor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> to the DUT <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>. Here the 8 bits of data are taken as an example; therefore, there are 8 clocks in time interval t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The corresponding stored data is transmitted in series from the DUT <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the microprocessor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Serial data output from a semiconductor memory device can be received, tested and compared by the microprocessor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. Therefore, data such as 8 bits of data output from the DUT <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are tested and compared by the microprocessor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. In time interval t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the tested and compared results are transmitted to the result and display device <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> by the microprocessor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. After the tested and compared results are received by the result sorting and display device <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, the tested results are sorted by the result sorting and display device <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. Moreover, a sorted result is displayed for the benefit of the operators checking the DUT <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In the conventional testing architecture of a semiconductor memory device, a time interval t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and a time interval t<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are needed, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>. The time interval t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is a delay time for the testing architecture <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> to make the DUT <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> stop transmitting data to the buffer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The time interval t<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is a time for the testing architecture <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> to activate the buffer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to transmit the data. But the invention can simultaneously finish the tested and compared operation in time interval t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. This is the greatest difference between the invention and the conventional testing architecture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, if a semiconductor memory device with 1M bits is tested, 1M clocks are read to test the data of the semiconductor memory device. Therefore, it takes at least {fraction (1/200)} kHz&times;IM bits&equals;5 seconds if the rate for accessing data is 200 kHz. In the conventional testing architecture, at least one clock is needed while every 8 clocks are transmitted. Thus, an extra 128 K clocks (IM/X&equals;128K) are needed. So the extra 7 seconds are needed. The accessing time is about 7 seconds. Therefore, by the conventional architecture, total duration is about 12 seconds for testing the semiconductor memory device with 1M bits. However, in the invention, the microprocessor such as an 8051 microprocessor can receive serial data and calculates quickly. The microprocessor takes just 6.5 seconds (the accessing time (5 seconds) plus the operating time (about 1.5 seconds). It is obvious that almost half the time is saved for one memory device. If a lot of memory devices are tested, a lot of time can be saved. Thus the testing performance is increased. Moreover, the capital expenditure can also be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a testing architecture of a semiconductor memory device according to the preferred embodiment of the invention. A microprocessor <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> such as an 8051 microprocessor with fast operation is connected to a personal computer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Thus, after the data stored in the DUT <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are accessed, the serial-to-parallel operation, the operation of driving the buffer to access the data, and the delay time added for avoiding the data overflow are not needed. The invention does not need the CPU of the personal computer to access, compare, and result sort the data. Therefore, the testing architecture of the invention avoids wasting time regarding the temporal non-availability of the CPU. In the invention, a low cost computer such as a personal computer can be used to test the semiconductor memory device so as to decrease capital expenditure and increase performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made to the structure of the present invention without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention. In view of the foregoing, it is intended that the present invention cover modifications and variations of this invention provided they fall within the scope of the following claims and their equivalents. </paragraph>
