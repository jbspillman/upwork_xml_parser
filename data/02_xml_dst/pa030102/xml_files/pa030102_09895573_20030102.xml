<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">An erosion fence installation attachment for ditchers and trenchers that is short in length and articulated to pivot in pitch and yaw so as to permit the attachment to follow a ditcher through gullies over mounds, and around arcs. The attachment is provided with a barrier material roll unwind, a resilient guide that guides the barrier material into a ditch formed by the ditcher so that the barrier materialP is pressed against the sides and bottom of the ditch to form an open channel, a first ditch fill disk that pushes fill material into the ditch and into the the channel formed in the barrier material, a second ditch fill disk that pushes fill material from the opposite side of the ditch and onto and over the barrier material on that side of the ditch to form a wrap around the fill material deposited by the first fill disk so as to form an elongate anchoring pouch filled with fill material along the bottom of the ditch. A stake driven along one side the above ground portion of the barrier material will penetrate at least two layers of the barrier material further securing the anchor in place. To form a barrier fence, the barrier material is secured to the stake by conventional means. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to barrier fences used to control erosion at construction sites and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> More specifically, this invention relates to an apparatus for inserting and anchoring barrier fences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Still more specifically, this invention relates the apparatus described above wherein the apparatus is in the form of an articulated attachment to a ditcher. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Construction sites and other erosion prone areas of landscape are prime candidates for the insertion of an erosion barrier. Historically, rocks, hay bales, and rooted plants and shrubs have served as erosion barriers. The development of low cost, reinforced, foramanous, plastic film, has made it the material of choice at construction sites where soil is laid bare and where even a benign water course can be severely eroded in a heavy rain. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The foraminous plastic film has numerous small openings through which water can pass, but only slowly. It is in this way that erosion barriers slow the speed of flowing water and thereby greatly reduce erosion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The installation of a barrier fence typically involves the burying of one long edge of the barrier material in a trench that is transverse to the water course and staking the above ground portion of the barrier material to hold it upright so as to form a barrier to water flow in the water course. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Erosion barriers having one edge buried in the ground have a number of deficiencies that are cured by the apparatus and methods of this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> One vexatious deficiency of barrier fences in use heretofore, is that of pulling out of the ground or falling over when a heavy water load is backed up by the barrier. This problem has its origins in the flow characteristics of wet soil as it takes up water and develops the consistency of mud. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A vexatious problem associated with the installation of barrier fences in use heretofore is that of requiring numerous machines, and/or, machine attachments, and/or significant manual labor to install the barrier fence. Erosion barriers of the type contemplated by this invention can be installed by manual means. The functions of digging a trench, unwinding the barrier material, inserting the barrier material in the trench, filling in the trench and staking the barrier in place are all operations that can and sometimes are performed by hand. The prior art abounds in machines and apparatus that perform the tasks of trenching, unwinding barrier material, positioning barrier material, filling trenches, and staking barriers. None of these prior art devices, alone or in combination can achieve the erosion barrier installation achieved by this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Yet another problem with prior art machines and apparatus for installing erosion barriers is that of length and inflexibility. Erosion barriers typically span a ditch or other undulating contours. Often it is desirable to install an erosion barrier in an arc. The inability of prior art barrier fence installing apparatus to follow contours and/or to follow curvatures due to their length and inflexibility limits the utility of the apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> It is an object of this invention to provide an articulated attachment to a ditcher that can follow the ditcher through undulations and around curves while inserting erosion barrier material in the ditch formed by the ditcher, and anchoring the barrier material while filling the ditch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> It is further an object of this invention to provide the articulated ditcher attachment described above wherein the attachment performs the functions of unwinding erosion barrier material, guiding the material into a trench formed by the ditcher, forming the material into conformance with the bottom and sides of the trench, Partially filling in the trench with filling soil deposited in the barrier material lining the trench, completing the filling of the trench so that the underground portion of the barrier material wraps the soil in the barrier lining the bottom of the treanch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> It is further an object of this invention to provide the attachment described above wherein the underground configuration of the barrier material is such that a stake driven along one side of the above ground portion of the barrier will penetrate at least one layer of the underground portion of the barrier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> It is further an object of this invention to provide the attachment described above wherein the attachment is short in length and easily attached to a ditcher. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Other objects will be made apparent by the following specifications, drawings and claims. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In the drawings, like numbers refer to like objects and the proportions of some elements have been modified to facilitate illustration. FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are schematic in that noncritical detail has been omitted for the sake of clarity of disclosure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The erosion fence installation attachment of this invention is to be attached to a part of a ditcher frame that is sturdy. Ditchers typically have a sturdy frame and the attachment of a pivot pin by welding or bolting or the like is readily accomplished. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, pivot pin <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is shown attached to ditcher frame <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of ditcher <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, erosion fence installation attachment <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> comprises an insertion frame <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> having depending therefrom a barrier material unwind <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, an insertion guide means <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, a first ditch fill disk <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and a second ditch fill disk <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Insertion frame <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is pivotably joined to ditcher frame <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> by means of sleeve <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> being placed over pin <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and secured in place thereon. The pivot formed by sleeve <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> rotating on pin <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> permits attachment <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to move in yaw mode so that attachment <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can follow ditcher <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> around turns. Insertion frame <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> has secured thereto barrier roll unwind <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> which positions barrier material roll <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> horizontally transverse to the operating line of ditcher <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> so that barrier material <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (shown in dashed lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) is positioned over ditch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> so as to create a short edge <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a long edge <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> relative to ditch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Insertion frame <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is pivotably joined to sleeve <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> by means of transverse horizontal pivot <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> that permits insertion frame <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to pivot in pitch so as to enable insertion frame <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to follow ditcher <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> over hills and through gullies. Insertion frame <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is provided with a resilient downward biasing means <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, hereshown schematically as a coil spring, for the purpose of maintaining the barrier material insertion attachment <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in contact with ditch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The articulation of ditcher <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> with carrier frame <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> by means of pivot pin <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and sleeve <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the articulation of insertion frame <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> with sleeve <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> by means of horizontal pivot <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> provides the art with a short length articulated erosion fence inserter means capable of following a ditcher around curves and through gullies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Insertion frame <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> has depending therefrom an insertion guide means <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> having a ditch bottom following shoe <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, a first ditch fill disk <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and a second ditch fill disk <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> As detailed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, ditcher <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> deposits material on both sides of ditch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> The material becomes fill material <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> when closing ditch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> with barrier material <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> positioned therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> As detailed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, insertion guide means <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> depends from insertion frame <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and projects into and along the sides of ditch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> so that barrier material <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> when passing along insertion guide means <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is pressed against the sides and along the bottom of ditch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Also, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the positioning of barrier material roll <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> relative to ditch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> causes the short edge <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of barrier material <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to be positioned along the side of ditch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and below the top edge of ditch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> while the long edge <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of barrier material <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> passes beside insertion guide means <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to form what will be the above ground portion of an erosion fence. Insertion guide means <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is configured so as to maintain long edge <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of barrier material <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from failing over ditch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and possibly interfering with the filling of ditch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Also, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</cross-reference>, bottom following shoe <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> rests on barrier material <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and presses it against the bottom of ditch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> as barrier material <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> passes along guide means <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> creating a channel that lines the bottom of ditch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, first ditch fill disk <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> serves to push fill material <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> from the side of ditch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> into the channel in barrier material <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> formed in the bottom of ditch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> thereby partially filling the channel formed in barrier material <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with fill material <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, second fill disk <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> closely follows fill disk <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and serves to push fill material <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> onto barrier material <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and into ditch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> so as to cause fill material <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to flow over barrier material <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and on top of the fill material <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> deposited by fill disk <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to create a wrap around the fill material <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> deposited by fill disk <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> creating an anchoring pouch <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> which serves to anchor barrier material <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the ground and renders it more difficult to dislodge than prior art erosion fences formed of barrier material <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the completion of erosion fence <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is achieved by driving support stakes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> through the portion of barrier material <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> that forms anchoring pouch <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and securing barrier material <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to stake <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> by conventional means. The driving of stakes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> through two of the layers of barrier material <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> that forms anchoring pouch <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> ensures that anchoring pouch <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> will not unwrap and thereby provides an anchor for erosion fence <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> that is more secure than has been heretofore obtainable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The use of fill disks <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> in place of the more conventional blades to push fill material <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> into ditch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> serves to permit the filling means to roll over impediments such as stones and roots and not get caught up on them as has been the case with blades and the like used to push fill material into trenches in the prior art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The close coupling of the functions of attachment <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> permits the insertion of barrier material <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> into trench <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> over a short distance and when combined with the articulations of attachment <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the resilient biasing of the members of attachment <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> enables the insertion of barrier material <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> into trenches <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> that turn more sharply and span deeper ditches than has heretofore been achievable by prior art apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The above disclosures are enabling and would permit one skilled in the art to make and use the disclosed invention without undue experimentation. However, it should be understood that the scope of the invention is not limited to the scope of the disclosed embodiments, but should only be limited by the scope of the appended claims and all equivalents thereto that would be made obvious thereby to one skilled in the art</paragraph>
