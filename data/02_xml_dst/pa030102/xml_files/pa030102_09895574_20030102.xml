<heading lvl="1">THE FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to flush valves for use in connection with toilet devices such as urinals and water closets, and more specifically, to a piston-type flush valve. More particularly, the invention relates to a relief valve head intended for aggressive water conditions that can be used in more than one type of piston flush valve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The relief valve functions as a semi-dynamic barrier between a pressurized water chamber above the flushometer piston and the fixture discharge outlet which is at a pressure close to atmospheric. To initiate the flush cycle, the relief valve is tipped by depressing the flushometer handle, thus venting the pressure chamber above the piston to the fixture outlet. This sudden pressure imbalance causes the piston to move upward from its seat and discharge a controlled volume of water. The relief valve returns to its rest position as soon as the flushometer handle or other actuation mechanism is released and the piston travels upward away from its seat area. The entire relief valve assembly contributes to controlling the flush volume delivered by an operating cycle of the valve. The flush volume is directly proportional to the length from the seating area of the head of the relief valve to the point at which the handle plunger strikes the relief valve stem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a relief valve which has been designed specifically to accommodate two different size flushometer pistons. There are a plurality of points around the perimeter of the relief valve that function as a centering means for the smaller piston. The inward curve of the perimeter between these points acts to allow water to flow past when tipped and to clear alignment pins found on some old style pistons sold by Sloan Valve Company, the assignee of the present application, under the trademark NAVAL. There are also a plurality of standing ribs on the relief valve shoulder that function to capture a spring used on the larger piston of the NAVAL brand flush valve. The relief valve spring functions to insure proper closing of the valve and a tight seal at low pressures between the valve and the seat around the relief valve vent passage. The raised center area or hub of the relief valve accommodates a spring used on the GEM-style flush valves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It is particularly advantageous that the relief valve shown and described herein is suitable for use on two different size and style of piston-type flushometers, both the GEM and the NAVAL products. This provides economy of scale in that one single part has multiple uses. Both the GEM and NAVAL flushometers are used in aggressive water conditions that include some combination of sediment and gray or sea water. The relief valve is particularly suitable in such an environment. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to flush valves for use with urinals and water closets, and more specifically, to two types of piston flushometers sold by Sloan Valve Company of Franklin Park, Illinois, under the trademarks NAVAL and GEM. This style of valve uses a piston assembly to control flow between the flush valve inlet and outlet. More specifically, the invention relates to an improved relief valve which controls flow between the pressure chamber above the piston assembly and the flush valve outlet, with movement of the relief valve functioning to relieve pressure in the pressure chamber to permit the piston assembly to rise and thus connect the flush valve inlet and outlet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The relief valve functions as a semi-dynamic barrier between the pressurized water chamber above the flushometer piston and the discharge to the fixture which is at a pressure close to atmospheric. To initiate the flush cycle, the relief valve is tipped by depressing the flushometer handle, thus venting the pressure chamber above the piston to the fixture outlet. This sudden pressure imbalance causes the piston assembly to move upward from its seat and discharge a controlled volume of water. The relief valve returns to its rest position as the handle or other actuation mechanism is released and the piston travels upward away from its seat area. The entire relief valve assembly contributes to controlling flush valve volume. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the flush valve body is indicated at <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and has an inlet <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and an outlet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. There is a top cover <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which is threadedly attached to the body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and defines a pressure chamber <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> positioned above a piston assembly indicated generally at <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Adjacent the outlet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> there is a handle assembly <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> which has a conventional manual handle <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> which, when activated, will move an interior plunger <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> which will cause the relief valve of the piston to move off its seat to institute the flushing cycle. This is conventional in valves of this type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a valve seat <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, with the piston assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> having a surface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> which closes upon the valve seat to prevent flow between the inlet <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the outlet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The piston assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes a piston <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and a guide <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> threadedly attached, as at <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The piston assembly has a top plate <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> mounted by screws <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to the piston <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. A rod <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> moves within a passage <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> in the top plate <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to control the flow of water from an opening <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> in the piston <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The opening <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is connected to the inlet <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and water will flow through the opening <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> into a chamber <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, around the rod, and then outwardly through the passage <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> into the pressure chamber <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The space between rod <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and passage <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> functions as the bypass orifice. Water within the pressure chamber <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> maintains the piston assembly on its valve seat <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to close flow between the inlet and the outlet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> There is a relief valve <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> biased by a spring <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> onto a relief valve seat <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> which may be a suitable sealing element. The relief valve has a stem <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> which extends downwardly into body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and is positioned adjacent the plunger <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The guide <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> has a vent passage <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> through which the stem of the relief valve passes. The vent passage controls and permits flow from the pressure chamber <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to the outlet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> when the relief valve is moved off of its seat by actuation of the handle <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> or any other suitable type of actuation device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In operation, when the handle is moved, the plunger will move into the body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> causing the relief valve to tilt off of its seal <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, permitting the pressure chamber <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to vent through passage <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and outlet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which permits the piston assembly to move up, off of its seat <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, so that there is direct flow between the inlet and the outlet. As is known in the art, flow through the bypass orifice determines flow into the pressure chamber <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to control the time during which the piston is off the valve seat and thus the volume of flow through the flush valve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The present invention is specifically concerned with the construction of the relief valve head which is indicated in detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 through 7</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates the relief valve as used in the GEM-brand flushometer, whereas, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> illustrate the relief valve as used in the NAVAL-brand flushometer. The relief valve is the same in each instance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Focusing on <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 through 7</cross-reference>, the relief valve includes a body <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> having a dome <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. There is a central cavity <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> which receives the relief valve gland <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. The relief valve stem <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> is positioned within gland <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. The body <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> has an outwardly-extending peripheral shoulder <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> which, as particularly illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, has a plurality, in this case eight, peripherally spaced curved indentations <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. These indentations will assist water flow past the refill head through the vent passage when the relief valve is tilted. They will also allow the refill head to clear alignment pins on certain old-style NAVAL flushometers. At each projection <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, formed between indentations <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, there is an upstanding rib <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> which functions to properly position and support the spring <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> as clearly shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. Thus, the ribs <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> locate the spring, which in turn biases the relief valve to its closed position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> As shown specifically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the underside <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> of shoulder <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> has a series of undulations <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> which generally correspond with the indentations <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to assist in the flow of water past the relief valve head. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> There is a downwardly-extending sleeve <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> which forms a part of the relief valve head body <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, which sleeve has a lower tapered surface <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and a plurality of gently inwardly-tapering ribs <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. The ribs <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> assist proper alignment of the relief valve within the vent passage <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> when it moves to its closed position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Turning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, and the GEM-style flushometer, the relief valve is the same as used in the NAVAL-brand flushometer. The piston assembly includes a hollow, generally cylindrical piston <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> which has a lower cylindrical extension <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> which is directly adjacent a piston seat area <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, with the seat area <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> being normally seated upon a seal member, not shown. There is a bypass orifice <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> controlled by a filter ring <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. Further details of the GEM-style flushometer are shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,881,993, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Focusing specifically on the relief valve, there is a spring <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> which extends about and is located by the dome <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. This spring urges the relief valve to the closed position in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> in which the shoulder <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is closed upon a seat or seal <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>. The outwardly extending projections <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> located between the undulations <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> function to properly locate and center the relief valve so as to maintain it in its appropriate position to close upon seat <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>. In other respects the relief valve functions in the manner described above and the only difference is the piston assembly environment in which the relief valve is located. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Whereas the preferred form of the invention has been shown and described herein, it should be realized that there may be many modifications, substitutions and alterations thereto. </paragraph>
