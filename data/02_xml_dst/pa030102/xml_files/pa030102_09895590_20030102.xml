<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">An apparatus, method and system are provided for hand-off of a communication session from a serving base station to a target base station. The preferred system includes a switch coupled to the serving base station and to the target base station. Respective first and second terminals at the serving and target base station share the same directory number, with the first terminal of the serving base station providing the communication session with the mobile unit. For a hand-off, the target base station transmits a request designating the shared directory number to the switch. Upon reception of the request, the switch bridges the target base station, through a bridged call path, into the communication session, through a second terminal of the target base station having the shared directory number, to form a three-way communication session. The mobile unit may then communicate with the target base station for continuation of the communication session through the bridged call path, and the serving base station is released from the three-way communication session. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates, in general, to wireless communication systems, and more particularly, to an apparatus, method and system for mobile wireless communication hand-off utilizing shared directory numbers. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Mobile wireless communication systems typically employ many base stations (such as cell sites) to provide wireless communication throughout a given geographic region. As a mobile unit (or, equivalently, mobile station) may traverse the geographic region, the communication to and from the mobile unit may occur through one or more of these base stations. To maintain an ongoing communication session during such transitions between base stations, various hand-off methods have evolved to transfer the wireless communication with the mobile unit from one base station to another base station, while maintaining such an ongoing call or session. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In the prior art, for some of the various methods utilized during such hand-offs, the communication session may suffer from some degree of interruption, which may be noticeable to the consumer of wireless communication services. As a consequence, a need remains to provide for comparatively seamless hand-offs, which do not interrupt ongoing communication sessions and which are imperceptible to the consumer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In addition, while other prior art systems may provide comparatively seamless hand-offs, such hand-offs typically utilize considerable network resources. In an Autoplex&reg; system, for example, in addition to switches and base stations, another network entity referred to as an Executive Call Processor (&ldquo;ECP&rdquo;) selects a server at the new cell site, while another network entity referred to as a Call Processing Database Node (&ldquo;CDN&rdquo;) transmits various data link messages to the current and new cell sites, adding an additional path to the existing call, directing the new cell site to activate a wireless voice link, and directing the current (serving) cell site to direct the mobile to retune to the new wireless voice link at the new cell site. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> As a consequence, a need remains for a wireless communication system to provide comparatively seamless and imperceptible hand-offs. In addition, such a wireless communication system should be reasonably efficient and capable of cost-effective implementation, eliminating or minimizing the use of additional network resources. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The wireless communication system of the present invention provides virtually seamless and imperceptible hand-offs of communication sessions of mobile units. The various embodiments of the present invention are reasonably efficient and capable of cost-effective implementation in existing communication equipment such as switches and base stations. Moreover, the various embodiments of the present invention eliminate or minimize the use of additional network resources such as ECPs and CDNs, while being compatible with other intelligent network devices and systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, an apparatus, method and system are provided for hand-off of a communication session utilizing shared directory numbers, in which the communication session of a mobile unit is transferred from a serving base station to a target base station. The preferred system includes a switch coupled to a serving base station and a target base station. Typically, each of the various base stations include a plurality of terminals which handle and process the communication sessions with mobile units and, in general, one or more terminals are assigned directory numbers (&ldquo;DNs&rdquo;). In accordance with the present invention, such DNs are shared by terminals in both the serving and target base stations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> When a hand-off of the communication session is indicated, the serving base station transmits a message, to the target base station, designating the shared directory number of the (first) terminal within the serving base station which is currently handling the communication session to be handed-off. The target base station then transmits a request or other message to the switch to join or bridge into the communication session at the specified or designated shared directory number. The switch then creates a bridged call path from the target base station (using a (second) terminal within the target base station having the same (i.e., shared) designated DN (of the first terminal within the serving base station), to the communication session of the first terminal within serving base station, to form a (reverse) three-way communication session among the mobile unit (via the serving base station), the target base station, and the switch. The mobile unit is then directed to communicate with the target base station for continuation of the communication session through the bridged call path, and the switch releases the serving base station from the three-way communication session. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> As a consequence, the communication session of the mobile unit has been handed off, seamlessly and without interruption, from the serving base station to the target base station. Such a hand-off has also occurred utilizing minimal network resources, the switch and the base stations, without involvement of other intelligent or supervisory network elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The bridged call path from the target base station to the switch is established through the transmission of various messages between the target base station and the switch. The switch is correspondingly configured to acknowledge and connect the bridged call path to the communication session upon receipt of these various messages. In the various embodiments, depending upon the ISDN configuration, such as custom or national, the target base station is configured to transmit a &ldquo;RECONNECT&rdquo; or &ldquo;RETRIEVE&rdquo; message, with the switch configured to transmit corresponding acknowledgements and other messages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Numerous other advantages and features of the present invention will become readily apparent from the following detailed description of the invention and the embodiments thereof, from the claims and from the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> While the present invention is susceptible of embodiment in many different forms, there are shown in the drawings and will be described herein in detail specific embodiments thereof, with the understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered as an exemplification of the principles of the invention and is not intended to limit the invention to the specific embodiments illustrated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, a need remains for a wireless communication system to provide comparatively seamless and imperceptible hand-offs, which is reasonably efficient and capable of cost-effective implementation, and which eliminates or minimizes the use of additional network resources such as ECPs and CDNs. In accordance with the present invention, a system, apparatus and method are illustrated which provide such advantages, namely, providing relatively seamless and imperceptible wireless hand-offs while utilizing minimal network resources (namely, utilizing existing switches and base stations configured in accordance with the invention), while simultaneously eliminating the prior art utilization of other network elements such as ECPs and CDNs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a block diagram illustrating such a system embodiment <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in accordance with the present invention. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a switch <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and one or more base stations (equivalently, cell sites) <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, such as first base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>and second base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>. Each of the various base stations include a plurality of terminals <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A</subscript></highlight>, <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>. . . <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>which handle and process the communication sessions with mobile units <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. In general, one or more terminals are assigned directory numbers, some of which are shared by two or more terminals. In accordance with the present invention, these DNs are shared by terminals across base stations, not just within a base station. The capability for two or more terminals to share a directory number is a feature of Integrated Services Digital Network (&ldquo;ISDN&rdquo;) communication systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The switch <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is preferably a telecommunication switch such as a <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> ESS&reg; switch or a 7RE switch manufactured by Lucent Technologies, Inc., which has been configured to operate in accordance with the present invention, as discussed in greater detail below. The switch <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is coupled to a network <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, for additional call routing. The switch <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may also be included within a mobile switching center, and may also be coupled to other intelligent network devices (not illustrated). The base stations <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> include wireless transceivers, for wireless communication with the various mobile units <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, such as cellular or other wireless telephones, wireless modems, or other mobile stations or wireless communication devices. The switch <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and base stations <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> are coupled to each other utilizing signaling and/or trunking lines <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, such as ISDN lines, as known in the art. In the preferred embodiment, the switch <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is connected to the various base stations <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> utilizing ISDN lines <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> As any mobile unit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> traverses a geographic region and becomes farther away from any given base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> with which it has been in communication, the signal or power levels of such wireless communication to and from the mobile unit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> typically drop below a preferred threshold or range. Under these circumstances, it is preferable for the given base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to hand-off the communication to another base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> having higher signal strength to and from the given mobile unit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. Continuing to refer to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, for example, the mobile unit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>(at a time t&lt;t<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>) is currently served by first base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A</subscript></highlight>, illustrated as communication or call paths (or legs) <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> (wireless) and <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> (wireline), with the portion of the communication session between the switch <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the network <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> separately illustrated as call path or leg <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>. In these circumstances, the first base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>is generally referred to as a serving base station or serving cell site. As the mobile unit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>travels toward the vicinity of base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><superscript>B</superscript></highlight>, such as toward mobile unit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>C</subscript></highlight>, it may become necessary or preferable for the first, serving base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>to hand-off the communication of mobile unit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>to the second base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>. In these circumstances, the second base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>is generally referred to as a target base station or target cell site. Such a hand-off, in accordance with the present invention, is illustrated below with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a block diagram illustrating a system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> embodiment, with the first communication path (legs <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>) illustrated from the switch <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and first base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>to the mobile unit and a second communication path <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> illustrated during a hand-off, in accordance with the present invention. To accomplish such a handoff in accordance with the present invention, and as explained in greater detail below, the serving base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>transmits a message to the target base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>containing or including a directory number (DN<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>) of the terminal <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>that is serving the mobile unit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>through the first communication path (call paths <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>). The target base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>then transmits a request to the switch <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, such as a reconnect message or a retrieve message, containing a reference to the same, shared directory number DN<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>. The switch then generates a second call path <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight>, over line <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, using the shared DN<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, to one of the terminals (<highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>D</subscript></highlight>) of the second base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>which has the same, assigned or shared directory number, and &ldquo;bridges&rdquo; the second call path <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> into the communication session of the first call path <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> to the terminal <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A</subscript></highlight>, forming a three-way call. As terminals at the serving base station and the target base station share the directory number, the bridging of the two paths <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> by the switch is analogous to a subscriber picking up a second telephone extension for an ongoing call in a residential telecommunication service model. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> As discussed in greater detail below, this is accomplished through transmission of various messages, the assignment of shared directory numbers to the terminals of the base stations <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, and configuring the switch <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to recognize particular messages as indicative of a request to join an existing communication session at a specific, shared DN. The hand-off then proceeds as illustrated below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a block diagram illustrating a system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> embodiment during completion of a hand-off from the serving base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>to the target base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>. When call path <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> (to and from the terminal <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>D </subscript></highlight>of the target base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>) has been bridged into the first call path <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> at the switch <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, in accordance with the present invention, the mobile unit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>determines or is instructed (generally by the serving base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A</subscript></highlight>) to tune to a specified channel of or otherwise set up a communication path to the target base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>, illustrated as call path <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, for continuing the same communication session via the bridged call path, i.e., through call path <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight>, which is a part or portion of the three-way communication session. The hand-off of the communication session from the serving base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>to the target base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>is then complete, and the communication path legs <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> may be torn down, with the communication session along call path legs <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> continuing uninterrupted, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As may be apparent from the above discussion, the hand-off of the communication session, from the serving base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>to the target base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>using a shared directory number, occurs seamlessly and without interruption. In addition, such a hand-off is accomplished without the need for additional network resources. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Another significant distinction of the present invention is that the target base station originates the actual hand-off of the communication session. A marked departure from the prior art, the bridged call path is not initiated by the switch <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, by the serving base station, or by any other network entity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a block diagram illustrating an apparatus embodiment <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in accordance with the present invention. As discussed in greater detail below, such an apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may be included within, or distributed between, a switch <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and/or a base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of a system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. (Numerous other variations and equivalent embodiments will be readily apparent and are also within the scope of the present invention.) The apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> includes a processor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, a network interface <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>, and a memory <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. The network interface <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> is utilized for voice communication and for transmission and reception of various messages, requests and responses discussed below, such as various messages utilized in National or Custom ISDN implementations. The memory <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> may be a magnetic hard drive, an optical storage device, a memory circuit, or any other type of data storage apparatus. The memory <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is used to store information pertaining to call placement, call set up, routing information, shared directory numbers, and program instructions or configurations, as discussed in greater detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Continuing to refer to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the processor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> may include a single integrated circuit (&ldquo;IC&rdquo;), or may include a plurality of integrated circuits or other components connected, arranged or grouped together, such as microprocessors, digital signal processors (&ldquo;DSPs&rdquo;), custom ICs, application specific integrated circuits (&ldquo;ASICs&rdquo;), field programmable gate arrays (&ldquo;FPGAs&rdquo;), associated memory (such as RAM and ROM), and other ICs and components. As a consequence, as used herein, the term processor should be understood to equivalently mean and include a single IC, or arrangement of custom ICs, ASICs, processors, microprocessors, controllers, FPGAs, or some other grouping of integrated circuits which perform the functions discussed above with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and also discussed in detail below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, with associated memory, such as microprocessor memory or additional RAM, DRAM, SRAM, MRAM, ROM, EPROM or E<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>PROM. The processor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> with its associated memory may be configured (via programming, interconnect or hard-wiring) to perform the methodology of the invention, as discussed above with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and as discussed below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. For example, the methodology may be programmed and stored, in the processor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> with its associated memory (and/or memory <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>) and other equivalent components, as a set of program instructions (or equivalent configuration or other program) for subsequent execution when the processor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is operative (i.e., powered on and functioning). Equivalently, when the processor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> with its associated memory and other equivalent components are implemented in whole or part as FPGAs, custom ICs and/or ASICs, the FPGAs, custom ICs or ASICs also may be designed, configured and/or hard-wired to implement the methodology of the invention. In the preferred embodiment, the processor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is implemented in its entirety as a microprocessor, which is programmed to implement the methodology of the invention. As mentioned above, such an apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may be included within, or distributed between, a switch <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and/or a base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a flow diagram illustrating a method embodiment in accordance with the present invention. Beginning with start step <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, the method determines that a hand-off is necessary or preferable, step <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>. This may be accomplished through various methods known in the art, from various requests transmitted by the serving base stations, such as base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A</subscript></highlight>, with responses from the potential target base stations, such as base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>, or by determinations made by the particular mobile unit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. Next, a target base station is selected for a hand-off, also as known in the art, such as base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>, step <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The serving base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>then transmits, to the selected target base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>, one or more information messages which include the shared directory number associated with the terminal of the serving base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>that is carrying or handling the communication session to be handed off, step <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>. Next, in step <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, the target base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>(via terminal <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>D </subscript></highlight>having the shared DN) is bridged, through a second, bridged call path, to the communication session on the first call path, to create a three-way communication session. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment, step <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is accomplished utilizing various ISDN messages. The target base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>commences the hand-off by transmitting to the switch <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> either a &ldquo;RECONNECT&rdquo; message (Custom ISDN implementation) or a &ldquo;RETRIEVE&rdquo; message (National ISDN implementation), with both message types including a call reference to the shared directory number (e.g., DN<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>), establishing call path <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight>. RECONNECT and RETRIEVE messages are compatible with ISDN Q.<highlight><bold>931</bold></highlight> standards and, given the state of the call in progress, are interpreted by the switch equivalently as a request to &ldquo;bridge&rdquo; into the communication session of the terminal (<highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A</subscript></highlight>) of serving base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>having the shared directory number. (It should be noted that for other call states, such as held calls, these ISDN messages may be interpreted to retrieve these calls, i.e., to take the call off hold.) The switch <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> transmits an acknowledgement to the RECONNECT (or RETRIEVE) message to the target base station, also with both message types including a call reference to the shared directory number (e.g., DN<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>). For National ISDN implementations, the switch follows the RETRIEVE acknowledgement with a &ldquo;NOTIFY&rdquo; message transmitted to the serving base station. For Custom ISDN implementations, the switch follows the RECONNECT acknowledgement with an information (INFO) message transmitted to the serving base station. A three-way communication session is thereby established among the mobile unit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>(via serving base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A</subscript></highlight>) and the target base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>(also with the other party to the communication session via the network <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Following the creation of the three-way session, the mobile unit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>tunes to a specified channel or otherwise sets up a communication path to the target base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>, illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> as call path <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, for continuing the communication session via the bridged call path <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight>, step <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight>. In the preferred embodiment, a variety of methods may be utilized to provide for such establishment of call path <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. For example, the mobile unit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>may be directed by the serving base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>to tune to a channel of the target base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>; or the mobile unit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>may initiate such tuning to the target base station. As the various target and serving base stations have independent signaling paths (illustrated generally as signaling and/or trunking line <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>), the target base station then generally informs or notifies the serving base station that the serving base station may now drop (tear down) its portion of the three-way call (the portion of call path <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> between the first base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>and switch <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>). As a consequence, in step <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, the previously serving base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>disconnects from the three-way call, and the switch <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> releases the call to this previously serving base station, thereby tearing down the communication path <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> (from the switch <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to the first base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A</subscript></highlight>), with the communication session continuing uninterrupted through links or call path legs <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Step <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> is preferably accomplished in a Custom ISDN implementation by a DISCONNECT message transmitted from the previously serving base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>to the switch <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, followed by an &ldquo;ASSOCIATED&rdquo; message from the switch <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, both having a call reference to the shared DN, thereby releasing the call. In a National ISDN implementation the DISCONNECT message from the serving base station <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>is followed by a RELEASE message from the switch, also having a call reference to the shared DN. Following the release in step <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, the method may end, return step <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the procedures outlined above could be used for subsequent hand-offs between any serving and target base station that include terminals having a shared directory number. This process may be continued for as many hand-offs as may be necessary for the given communication session of the mobile unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Numerous advantages of the present invention may be apparent from the above discussion. First, as illustrated above, the wireless communication system of the present invention provides virtually seamless and imperceptible hand-offs of communication sessions of mobile units. Second, the various embodiments of the present invention are reasonably efficient and capable of cost-effective implementation in existing communication equipment such as switches and base stations. Moreover, the various embodiments of the present invention eliminate or minimize the use of additional network resources such as ECPs and CDNs, while being compatible with other intelligent network devices and systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> From the foregoing, it will be observed that numerous variations and modifications may be effected without departing from the spirit and scope of the novel concept of the invention. It is to be understood that no limitation with respect to the specific methods and apparatus illustrated herein is intended or should be inferred. It is, of course, intended to cover by the appended claims all such modifications as fall within the scope of the claims.</paragraph>
