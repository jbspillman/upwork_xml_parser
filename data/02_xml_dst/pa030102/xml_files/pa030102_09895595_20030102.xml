<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a device and a method for optimizing the operating point of power amplifiers in mobile stations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In transmitting devices in mobile stations MS, power amplifiers PA are used which amplify the transmit signal, which is modulated by the data to be transmitted, before it is supplied to the antenna. The energy necessary for this is taken from the battery contained in the mobile station MS. The required effective radiated power depends on a number of parameters such as the distance of the mobile station MS from the base station, the radio-frequency channel loss, the noise of the radio-frequency channel, the spectral characteristics of the radio-frequency channel, the transmission method, etc. To save energy and thus to achieve the longest possible battery life, the radiated power is adapted in accordance with one or more of these parameters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In mobile radio systems based on the time division multiplex (TDM) method, the radiated power is generally specified separately for each time slot and is constant for the duration of the time slot. As a rule, the radiated power can be selected in steps and a maximum radiated power must not be exceeded. Between the active time slots, the power amplifier is switched off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Before the beginning of an active time slot, the power amplifier is switched on and the gain is gently ramped up from minimum to the desired value by a control signal v(t) generated in the MS, in such a manner that no noise spectra interfering with the neighboring channels occur. The course of this gain or power ramp is determined by a power ramp controller. During the active phase of the time slot, the gain is kept approximately constant and ramped down again at the end. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> So that the power amplifier can produce the gain required in each case, its operating point (OP) must be correspondingly selected. Since it is not obvious from the control signal v(t) at the beginning of an active time slot what maximum gain v<highlight><subscript>max </subscript></highlight>is needed in the active part of the time slot, it must be assumed that it can also be the greatest gain v<highlight><subscript>o </subscript></highlight>which can be set. For this reason, the operating point OP must be selected in such a manner right at the start that the power amplifier can produce the greatest possible gain v<highlight><subscript>o</subscript></highlight>. In most cases, however, the maximum possible gain v<highlight><subscript>o </subscript></highlight>is not needed within an active time slot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, the basic current consumption of the power amplifier depends on the operating point OP selected. The higher it is selected to be, the greater the current consumption. If thus the operating point OP is selected to be unnecessarily high at low radiated powers, the efficiency is correspondingly low and the battery is unnecessarily loaded which shortens the battery life. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is accordingly an object of the invention to provide an apparatus and a method for optimizing the operating point of a power amplifier in a mobile radio station, which overcome the above-mentioned disadvantageous of the prior art apparatus and methods of this general type. In particular, the apparatus and the method enable the efficiency of the mobile radio station to be improved and, at the same time, enable the required radiated power to always available. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In accordance with an added feature of the invention, an analog signal is used as the control signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In accordance with an additional feature of the invention, an analog voltage signal is used as the control signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another feature of the invention, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. the control signal is provided as a digital signal which allows the operating point to be switched in steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a further feature of the invention, the control signal is generated in a chip that includes components selected from the group consisting of a power ramp controller and a D/A converter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a further added feature of the invention, an analog voltage signal is used as the control signal; and a D/A converter for setting the operating point is integrated in the power amplifier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a further additional feature of the invention, the control signal is also used to switch the power amplifier on and off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another added feature of the invention, the power gain of the power amplifier is set independently of the control signal for adapting the operating point. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another additional feature of the invention, the control signal for adapting the operating point is provided with an adjustable timing relationship with respect to a power ramp control signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In accordance with yet an added feature of the invention, a common sequence controller is used to control the timing of the setting of the operating point and the timing of a power ramp. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In accordance with yet an additional feature of the invention, an analog voltage signal is used as the control signal; and a D/A converter for the control signal is switched off during inactive time slots. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In accordance with yet another feature of the invention, the power amplifier is provided in a mobile station. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In accordance with yet a further feature of the invention, the power amplifier is provided in a mobile station that supports a standard selected from the group consisting of a GSM standard, a EDGE standard, a TIA/EIA-136 standard (IS-136), a UMTS standard, and a part-combination including any of the stated standards. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> With the foregoing and other objects in view there is provided, in accordance with the invention the combination of a power amplifier that has an operating point and that is located in a mobile station, and a device providing a control signal that adapts the operating point of the power amplifier to the maximum power gain that is needed within a certain time interval. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> A significant aspect of the invention lies in the fact that an additional control voltage is used. The amplitude of the additional control voltage is a measure of the maximum gain v<highlight><subscript>max </subscript></highlight>that is needed during the current time slot and that is already provided to the power amplifier before the beginning of the active time slot. In this manner, an individual adjustment of the operating point is made possible, with the aim of reducing the power consumption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The device for optimizing the operating point includes a D/A converter <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> having an input receiving, from a system controller <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, at least one digital value 13 per time slot. The D/A converter <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> outputs an analog value 41 to the power amplifier <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The analog value 41 is based on the digital value 13 and is synchronized in time with the sequence controller by means of the signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> This embodiment of the invention offers the following advantages: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> a) The system controller <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, which also defines the shape and amplitude of the power ramps and transmits these to the power ramp controller <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> through the connection <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, thus also knows the maximum gain v<highlight><subscript>max </subscript></highlight>needed in a time slot and the system controller <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can therefore also determine the digital value 13 which it supplies to the D/A converter <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> b) The operating point can be set before the beginning of the time slot; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> c) The precise time when a new analog value 41 is to be output can be precisely synchronized with the power ramp and the time slot through the link <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> with the sequence controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> d) The arrangement can be completely integrated in the chip which is used for controlling the power amplifier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the following special features can be seen: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> a) Since the gain is still determined only by the signal v(t), the system is also compatible with power amplifiers which do not have any capability for being able to individually adjust the operating point. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> b) The D/A converter can be switched off in the time intervals between active time slots to save current as is generally also the case with the power ramp controller and the power amplifier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Thus, a time-slot-specific optimization of the operating point can be performed in the invention. The operating point of the power amplifier of the mobile radio station can be set for each time slot in accordance with the radiated power required in this time slot or, respectively, the required gain of the power amplifier. The operating point of the power amplifier thus does not need to be set to be higher for each time slot than for the maximum gain v<highlight><subscript>max </subscript></highlight>required in this time slot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, it is possible to set the operating point of the power amplifier even before the beginning of the power ramp. Furthermore, the variation with time and the amplitude of the gain can be exclusively specified by the control signal v(t). To implement the invention, only one additional signal output is needed at a maximum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Other features which are considered as characteristic for the invention are set forth in the appended claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Although the invention is illustrated and described herein as embodied in optimization of the operating point of power amplifiers in mobile stations, it is nevertheless not intended to be limited to the details shown, since various modifications and structural changes may be made therein without departing from the spirit of the invention and within the scope and range of equivalents of the claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The construction and method of operation of the invention, however, together with additional objects and advantages thereof will be best understood from the following description of specific embodiments when read in connection with the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the figures of the drawing in detail and first, particularly, to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> thereof, there is shown a device which contains all of the required elements for the most general form of the invention and additional further special embodiments, and which shows additional blocks which are of advantage for understanding the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The device in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> includes a system controller <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which transmits data for the power ramps <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to the power ramp controller <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and synchronization information <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the sequence controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The power ramp controller <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, in turn, with the aid of the D/A converter <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, outputs the power ramp as an analog signal v(t) at the times specified by the sequence controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> by means of the synchronization information <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The signal v(t) is supplied to the power amplifier <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The power amplifier <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> determines its gain, and thus the power level of the transmit signal x(t). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> From the data <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, the modulator <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> forms the modulated signal s(t), which is synchronized in time with the power ramp by means of the synchronization information <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and which is amplified by the power amplifier <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and is output as the transmit signal x(t). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> As an additionally inventive feature, the device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> includes a D/A converter <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> which has an input receiving digital values 13 from the system controller <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The D/A converter <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> outputs an analog signal a(t), obtained from the digital value 13, after having been requested to do so by the sequence controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, e.g. by means of a pulse, via the synchronization line <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. The signal a(t) corresponds to the maximum gain v<highlight><subscript>max </subscript></highlight>needed in the associated time slot and remains unchanged until a new digital value 13 is present at the input and a pulse has been sent by the sequence controller. If the D/A converter is switched off, the value a(t)&equals;0 V is output. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The signal a(t) is supplied to the power amplifier <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, where it is used as a parameter for setting the operating point and/or other amplifier parameters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows by way of example the simplified variation of the signals v(t) and a(t) with time for a sequence of different time slots. The signal a(t) is output before the beginning of the power ramp in order to bring the power amplifier to the corresponding operating point. In the case of successive active time slots, the operating point is switched over during the transition phase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Times t1-t4 mark the following phases: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> t1 is the beginning of the power ramp which ramps the gain up to v<highlight><subscript>max1 </subscript></highlight>and down; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> t2 is the beginning of the power ramp which ramps the gain up to v<highlight><subscript>max2</subscript></highlight>; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> t3 is the beginning of the power ramp which ramps the gain down from vmax.2 to v<highlight><subscript>max3</subscript></highlight>; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> t4 is the end of the transmit sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows, by way of example, the setting of the operating points of the power amplifier <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and the modulation ranges of the transmit signal for the operating conditions shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>.
