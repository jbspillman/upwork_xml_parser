<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Referring to the drawings and initially to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, a safety device of a water faucet of a drinking machine in accordance with the present invention comprises a safety bolt <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> mounted on a water faucet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The water faucet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a housing having a water outlet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and a water inlet <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which communicate with each other in the housing of the water faucet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The housing of the water faucet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> contains therein a control rod <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> which has one end protruded outward from the housing of the water faucet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. A control handle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is mounted outside of the water faucet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and has one end pivotally mounted on the one end of the control rod <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> for driving the control rod <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to move therewith so as to control the water output of the water faucet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. An elastic retractable water control bushing <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> made of rubber and a spring <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are mounted on the control rod <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The water control bushing <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> initially closes and seals the water outlet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the water faucet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, so that the water cannot flow out. The control handle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may then be driven by pulling the control handle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> upward or pressing the control handle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> downward. When the control handle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the water faucet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is driven to pivot upward as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the control rod <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is moved upward to compress and retract the water control bushing <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, thereby detaching the water control bushing <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> from the water outlet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to open the water outlet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the water faucet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, thereby connecting the water inlet <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the water outlet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, so that the water may be introduced through the water inlet <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> into the water outlet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to flow outward from the water outlet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the water faucet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The control rod <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is formed with a locking groove <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>.
