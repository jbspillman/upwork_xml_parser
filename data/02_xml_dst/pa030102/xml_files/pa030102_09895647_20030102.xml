<section>
<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates in general to the field of remote data acquisition and transmission, and more particularly, to a method and system for interfacing a machine control system and a wireless network for communicating information such as for monitoring and controlling distributed machines, such as vending machines. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Although industrial and commercial equipment manufacturers have developed new and innovative equipment for managing, monitoring and controlling remotely-distributed industrial equipment and machine controllers, significant difficulties remain in the seamless integration of available wireless technology into industrial equipment. For instance, remotely distributed vending machines are sometimes interfaced with a central data and control center to monitor and control inventory. Wireless communications are one possible way of transmitting vending machine information from remote locations. However, fragmented communication networks provide a challenge for incorporating wireless communication into remotely located systems. More specifically, different geographical locations employ different wireless communication networks. Thus it is difficult to deploy wireless communications systems that are reliably interfaced with a wireless network in a given geographical location. There simply is not a cost effective wireless system uniformly available throughout the United States. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> One possible solution is to provide wireless communications as an add-on package external to the industrial equipment. However, integration of add-on wireless communications with the industrial equipment tends to increase costs compared with integration of wireless communications into the industrial equipment. Further, the difficulty of deploying compatible wireless communications is compounded where the communications system is integrated into industrial machine controllers, such as vending machine controllers, at the time of manufacture of the industrial machine. For instance, if a vending machine is built with a given wireless system, the cost of shipping the vending machine is wasted if the wireless systems proves incompatible or unreliable at the destination location. Although the vending machine may be built with multiple wireless communication systems, this increases the expense of the design and configuration of specific systems and may lead to delay in production of such systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Another difficulty associated with deploying wireless systems is that multiple systems often work in a given geographical area with one wireless system preferable over the other available systems. For example, two wireless networks may be available for communicating information in a given location. However, one of the networks may have a stronger signal based on the position or location of the system within a building or structure. If a system is designed to communicate with the weaker network, the system&apos;s performance may be reduced compared with the performance available were the system able to interact with the other wireless network having a stronger signal. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Therefore a need has arisen for a system and method which aids in the distribution of industrial machines over distributed geographical regions with wireless communications that are compatible with different wireless communications systems operable in the geographical regions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A further need has arisen for a system and method which embeds wireless communications into industrial machines such that the machines adapt to a variety of wireless networks without including compatibility for each potential type of network in each machine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In accordance with teachings of the present disclosure, a system and method are provided that substantially eliminates or reduces disadvantages and problems associated with previously developed systems and methods for integrating wireless communications with industrial machines. A wireless interface module communicates with the industrial machine control system and with a wireless network through one of plural wireless transceivers. By selecting a wireless transceiver that is compatible with a selected wireless network for installation in an industrial machine at a selected geographic location, the wireless interface module provides an integrated system with flexibility for industrial machine communication with a preferred wireless network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> More specifically, a wireless interface module establishes a standardized communication interface with an industrial machine control system, such as a vending machine control system. The vending machine control system communicates available control information, such as the status of the vending machine or inventory of vending items, to the wireless interface module. For instance, the wireless interface module couples into a standardized slot of the control system. The wireless interface module then provides the vending machine information to a wireless transceiver so that the information is communicated from the remote geographic location to a central location through a desired wireless network. The wireless transceivers are removably coupled to the wireless interface module with a standardized port so that changing from one wireless network to another is easily accomplished by replacing a removably coupled transceiver with a new removably coupled transceiver associated with the desired wireless network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The wireless interface module is operable to communicate with one of plural wireless transceivers, with each wireless transceiver compatible with one of the plural wireless communication networks. In order to locate a vending machine at a predetermined location so that the vending machine is compatible with a desired wireless network associated with the location, a compatible wireless transceiver is installed to communicate with the wireless interface module and the network. Thus, integration of wireless communications into the vending machine is provided by the wireless interface module and compatibility with a desired wireless network is provided by selecting and installing an appropriate transceiver for the wireless interface module. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The present invention allows the installer of a vending machine at a distributed geographic location to determine an appropriate wireless network by testing different wireless transceivers to determine which wireless transceiver establishes the best performance at the location from among the different available networks. For instance, wireless networks having a generally weak signal are eliminated from consideration and a preferred wireless network is then selected from those having an acceptable signal based on technical and business considerations such as cost. The wireless interface module provides one or more different types of interfaces for the different types of transceivers, such as appropriate buses and power connections. Further, plural transceivers and a variety of peripheral devices are supported by the wireless interface module to provide redundant local area and personal area networks as well as multimedia, security and payment system functionalities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a number of important technical advantages. One important technical advantage is that machines are easily distributed over geographical regions with wireless communications that are compatible with different wireless communications systems operable in the geographical regions. The wireless interface module is embedded in the machine to communicate with the machines internal components, such as by inserting the wireless interface module into a slot of a machine&apos;s mother board or controller. Different wireless transceivers are then available to interface with the wireless interface module so that the transceiver most compatible with the geographic region is installed into the machine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Another important technical advantage of the present invention is that it allows the embedding of an integrated wireless communication system into distributed industrial and commercial machines, such as vending machines, with reduced cost and increased reliability. The machines adapt to a variety of wireless networks without including compatibility for each potential type of network in each machine. The most appropriate wireless transceiver or transceivers are installed for each location so that unnecessary transceivers are not included into the machines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Another important technical advantage of the present invention is the reduced expense and complexity for deploying industrial and commercial machines with integrated wireless communications. Reduced production and deployment costs are achieved by leveraging machine systems, such as power, to support the wireless interface module and by eliminating extra enclosures generally associated with aftermarket systems. Further, only minor alterations are necessary to adapt machine controllers to communicate with the wireless interface module without substantial re-engineering of machine controller firmware and with minor incremental hardware costs since the wireless interface module is installable as an optional daughter card and the actual wireless transceiver is selectable based on the desired wireless network. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Preferred embodiments of the invention and its advantages are best understood by reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, wherein like numerals indicate like and corresponding parts of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The present invention aids in the distribution of commercial and industrial machines, such as vending machines, with embedded wireless communications systems through distributed geographic regions. Machine manufacturers may incorporate a wireless interface module and communicate control and status information to a wireless interface module, such as through a standard interface. For instance, the wireless interface module collects vending information from buses and other data sources of the vending machine through an internal interface that allows incorporation of the wireless interface module or card into the vending machine itself. The wireless interface module prepares that information for transmission over wireless networks and then provides the information to a removably coupled wireless transceiver. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The present invention allows industrial and commercial machines, such as vending machines, to be shipped &ldquo;wireless ready&rdquo; and yet easily adapted to communicate with a desired wireless network by coupling a wireless transceiver associated with the wireless network to the wireless interface module. Further, by interfacing the wireless interface module as a daughter card that fits into a standardized slot or other standardized connector of the machine controller, the expense of integration of a wireless system can be avoided when desired by not installing the daughter card while the flexibility of future conversion to a wireless system remains. In alternative embodiments, the present invention can be incorporated with a variety of industrial and commercial machines to communicate with a wireless network, such as HVAC, pipeline controllers, water treatment, copy machine and fountain beverage controllers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> An example of vending machines interfaced through a wireless network is depicted by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. A remote data acquisition system for vending machines, indicated generally at <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> communicates information from a vending site <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> externally over a wide area wireless network (WAN) and internally over a local area wireless network (LAN). As shown, the local area network at vending site <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be referred to as a vendor interrogation LAN subsystem (VIL). Vending site <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may include only one vending machine <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> or a plurality of vending machines <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Each vending machine <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may include vending hardware and inventory <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for performing vending functions and electronically tracking some vending information. Vending machines <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may provide various types of products to customers such as soft drinks, snacks, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Vending machines <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> include an application controller <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> coupled to and interfacing with vending hardware and inventory <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. As described in greater detail with respect to FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, application controller <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> includes a wireless interface and a transceiver for WAN, LAN and point-to-point communications. Many vending machines <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are equipped with a controller for controlling vending operations as well as tracking some vending events such as money received, change given and number of vends from each slot. Application controllers <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> communicate with such controllers and directly sense other vending events and vending equipment parameters (e.g. compressor performance). Application controllers <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> also communicate with one another and the application host <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> via onboard wireless transceivers using wireless transmissions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;wireless transmissions&rdquo; is used to refer to all types of electromagnetic communications which do not require a wire, cable, or other types of conduits. Examples of wireless transmissions for use in local area networks (LAN) include, but are not limited to, radio frequencies, especially the 900 MHZ and 2.4 GHz bands, such as IEEE 802.11 and BLUETOOTH, as well as infra-red, and laser. Examples of wireless transmissions for use in wide area networks (WAN) include, but are not limited to, narrowband personal communications services (nPCS), personal communication services (PCS such as CDMA, TMDA, GSM) circuit switched cellular, and cellular digital packet data (CDPD), etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Together, application controllers <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and application host <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> form a LAN supported by the wireless transmissions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In addition, application controllers <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can also communicate directly with each other and with wide area network <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to act as repeaters in case application host <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> cannot directly communicate with a particular application controller <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> while another application controller <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, which does have an established communication link with application host <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, can directly communicate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The WAN interface <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be implemented in one of a number of ways. In particular, WAN interface <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is designed to support a wide area network <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> that can be implemented via wireless transmissions. If a wireless narrowband PCS paging network is used to implement the WAN, messages from application host <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be communicated as digital messages through the pager network and stored in one or more dedicated message mailboxes provided by the wireless network operator. These mailboxes can be securely accessed, for example, through an Internet-based connection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> network operations center (NOC) <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> communicates with one or more vending sites <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> across wide area network <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. As mentioned, in one implementation, network operations center <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> can access mailboxes that store message transmitted by application hosts <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> at vending sites <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, network operations center <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> includes a NOC control <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> that communicates with wide area network <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> through a WAN interface <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. NOC control <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> can receive data acquired from and transmit data to vending sites <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, process the data and store the data into a database <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. NOC control <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> can also perform instant alert paging, direct dial alarms and other functions to provide real time notification to a vending operator upon the occurrence of certain events (e.g., out-of-stock, power outage, vandalism, etc.). NOC control <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> can also provide third party transaction processing such as allowing queries on database <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The WAN interface <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> between NOC control <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the wide area network <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can be implemented through the use of either wire-line or wireless transmissions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> At network operations center <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, a client access point <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> provides access from a client interface subsystem (CI) <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> across external network <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. In one implementation, client access point <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can be a web-based interface allowing user access from a client computer across a network such as the Internet. Other implementations include providing a direct-dial connection between client interface subsystem <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and client access point <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Once connected, a user can use client interface subsystem <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to obtain information from database <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> based upon data acquired from vending sites <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Further, users can be provided with extended services such as trend information developed by mining and analyzing database <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> schematic illustration of a system operable to communicate with a wireless network is depicted. A vending machine control system <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is depicted that includes a bus interface, depicted as a slot or connector <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Controller <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is conventional hardware, firmware and software associated with vending hardware and inventory <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> except that an interface slot <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> provides a standardized bus interface slot for accepting a wireless interface module <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Controller <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> controls vending machine electronic devices and communicates data relating to vending machine information through slot <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to wireless interface module <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Interface slot <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> may be any computer industry standard interface, such as industry standard interfaces including a PCI, ISA, PC104, etc. . . . slot interface operable to communicate data and power to cards inserted in the slot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Wireless interface module <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is operable to accept data and power from the vending machine control system <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and to prepare the data for transmission across a wireless network. Similarly, wireless interface module <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> accepts and processes command and control data from a wireless network for transfer to controller <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. For instance, wireless interface module <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> prepares data for transmission through a data cable <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to a wireless transceiver <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> that communicates with an associated wireless network and executes tasks, such as fetching status from the machine controller, based on command and control data received from the network through wireless transceiver <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. By removably coupling different types of wireless transceivers <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to wireless interface module <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, controller <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is enabled to communicate over different types of networks. Thus, wireless interface module <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and wireless transceiver <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> perform the functions of application controller <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in a local wireless network and the functions of application controller <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and application host and WAN interface <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> when a vending machine <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> interfaces directly with wireless WAN <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Wireless interface module <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> also includes a serial data port, such as a universal serial bus (USB) data port <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, operable to couple one or more peripheral(s) <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> in a daisy chain fashion. Peripheral(s) <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> may include multimedia devices such as a speaker operable to output audio signals received via wireless interface module <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, an E-lock, or a video screen. In one alternative embodiment, a BLUETOOTH wireless system interfaces with wireless interface module <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> through USB port <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to provide a personal area network that can be used by vending consumers to interact with the vending machine, such as for performing wireless financial or cash transactions. LED lights associated with wireless interface module <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> provide visual indications of the operability and current functions of the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> To communicate with wireless networks, a wireless antenna <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is coupled to wireless transceiver <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to receive and send wireless signals. In an alternative embodiment, a wireless antenna <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> couples to wireless interface module <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and communicates with transceiver <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> through a coaxial cable <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Wireless transceiver <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> communicates with and receives power from wireless interface module <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> through a data and power cable <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the invention, plural wireless transceivers <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are coupled to wireless interface module <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> via data and power cable <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>.

Some examples of wireless communication networks and protocols operable to be used with the present invention may include, but are not limited to, CDMA, GSM, TDMA, PCS, GPRS, CDPD, AMPS, REFLEX and UMTS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In operation, a vending machine manufacturer builds the vending machine as wireless-ready by incorporating wireless interface module <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to communicate with the vending machine&apos;s control system <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The vending machine is then shipped to its operational location and provided power. A technician need only attach an appropriate wireless transceiver <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to wireless interface module <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to interface the vending machine with the associated wireless network. The technician simply tests reception at the location, for instance by installing different transceivers or through conventional coverage analysis techniques, to determine the most suitable wireless network and then installs the associated wireless transceiver <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Advantageously, vending machines that are installed in network &ldquo;dead zones&rdquo; are simply equipped to operate with a communication system or network that has acceptable signal strength and desired data transfer ability and cost structures. Further, if the vending machine is moved at a future date, a suitable wireless transceiver <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is installed to convert the vending machine to a different network as needed with minimal cost, time and complexity. Wireless interface module <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> detects the transceiver and network that is being used and adapts the low level communication protocols to handle transmission and reception with the network while maintaining the application level communications protocol fixed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Although the present invention has been described with respect to a specific preferred embodiment thereof, various changes and modifications may be suggested to one skilled in the art and it is intended that the present invention encompass such changes and modifications fall within the scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
