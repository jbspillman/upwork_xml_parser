<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention pertains generally to vehicle seats, and more particularly to a headrest which in an accident is permanently deformed by the force of a passenger&apos;s head, thereby absorbing energy and reducing whiplash. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Headrests for vehicle seats are well known in the art. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,547,486 shows an angularly and vertically adjustable head rest which is secured to the top of a back rest forming part of a vehicle seat. The head rest may be immobilized in a desired height position by a locking mechanism disposed entirely within, and surrounded by, the foam plastic cushion of the head rest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,769,489 illustrates an energy absorbing support for vehicular passengers which comprises apparatus for preventing or limiting spinal injuries to a passenger seated in a forward facing position in a moving vehicle during vehicular impact or sudden deceleration. The apparatus includes a vehicle installed supporting seat for the passenger, the seat having a support portion behind the seated passenger which includes a resilient surface in contact with the supported passenger. The resilient portion is supported on an underlying stiff support shell. The support shell is rearwardly displaceable upon being subjected to impressed forces generated from the passenger pressing against the resilient surface of the support portion as a result of a rear end impact on the vehicle. A controllably deformable energy absorbing crush zone is positioned to the rear of the shell and is compressed by rearward displacement of the shell. The support portion acts to decelerate the supported spine of the passenger during a vehicle rear end impact, while the controlled deformation of the crush zone absorbs energy to prevent or limit spinal injuries of the passenger. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,823,619 discloses a vehicle seat which includes a back rest with a headrest. A flexible traction element extends through the interior of the back rest and is adapted to respond to the movement of an inertial mass shifted in a rear end impact and to cause a displacement of an attachment means of the traction element on the headrest. The displacement is converted in a mechanical setting mechanism, coupled with the traction element, into a movement of the headrest toward the head of the occupant to reduce the distance between the headrest and the head of the occupant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,836,648 shows a vehicle seat having a seat part and a backrest adjustable in inclination relative to the seat part. The backrest is configured in two parts, a top backrest part and a bottom backrest part. The top backrest part pivots relative to the bottom backrest part. The holding force of a clamping device is overcome in a crash due to movement of the person in the seat. The top backrest part moves to intercept the person in the seat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,961,182 describes a seat having a resilient surface in contact with the supported passenger. The resilient surface is supported on an underlying stiff support shell. The support shell is rearwardly displaceable in a rear end collision by the forces generated by the passenger pressing against the resilient surface. A controllably deformable energy absorbing crush zone is disposed to the rear of the shell and is compressed by rearward displacement of the shell. The support portion acts to decelerate the supported spine of the passenger during a vehicle rear end impact, while the controlled deformation of the crush zone absorbs energy, to prevent or limit spinal injuries to the passenger. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 6,024,405 depicts a head restraint assembly having an adjustable head restraint member which is securable in position between a forward position and a rearward position by a helical coil locking member. The locking member is in a normally relaxed state of smaller internal diameter than the external diameter of a transverse support rod with which it is engaged. Rotation of one end of the locking member with respect to the other end partially unwinds the locking member, thereby releasing its grip on the support rod. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to an improved headrest for a vehicle seat which permanently deforms during a rear end collision. The deformation absorbs and dissipates much of the kinetic energy of a passenger&apos;s head, and thereby minimizes the opposite forward whipping action of the head and neck which occurs immediately after a collision. In one embodiment of the present invention, the posts which support the padded portion of the headrest are permanently deformable. In another embodiment, spaced rods absorb the energy of the rearwardly moving head. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, a permanently deformable headrest for a vehicle seat has a permanently deformable structure, so that when a passenger&apos;s head is thrown back against the headrest during a rear end collision, the structure is permanently deformed in a rearward direction, thereby absorbing much of the kinetic energy of the passenger&apos;s head. The force of the passenger&apos;s head causes the permanently deformable structure to exceed its elastic limit, and thereby assume a permanently deformed or bent shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In accordance with an important aspect of the invention, the permanently deformable structure includes at least one permanently deformable post which mounts the headrest to the vehicle seat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In accordance with an important feature of the invention, the permanently deformable structure includes at least one horizontal permanently deformable member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another important aspect of the invention, the permanently deformable structure includes at least one vertical permanently deformable member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another important feature of the invention, once the permanently deformable headrest has been deformed, it must be replaced with a new undeformed headrest, or in the first embodiment the deformable posts must be replaced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, which illustrate, by way of example, the principles of the invention. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Referring initially to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, there is illustrated a side elevation view of either a driving or non-driving passenger <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> sitting in a forward facing vehicle seat <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> having a conventional headrest <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>. Headrest <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> is usually mounted to the top of seat <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> by a post or posts <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> which allow headrest <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> to be moved up and down in directions <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> respectively. Posts <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> slidably enter a support means located within vehicle seat <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>. When in the shown up position, headrest <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> is intended to stop the rearward movement of the head <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> of passenger <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> during a rear end collision. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a side elevation view of the passenger&apos;s head <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> being thrown back in direction <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> against headrest <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> during a rear end collision. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a side elevation view of the passenger&apos;s head <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> being thrown forward in direction <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> immediately after the rear end collision. That is, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference> comprise a backward and forward cycle which the passenger&apos;s head <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> experiences during a rear end collision. The head <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> is first thrown back by the force of the collision, and then thrown forward by the whipping action of seat <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> and headrest <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> when the collision force abates. It is this rapid back and forth action that results in many whiplash injuries. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference> are side elevation and rear elevation views, respectively, of a passenger <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> sitting in a vehicle seat <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> having a permanently deformable headrest, generally designated <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, in accordance with the present invention. Permanently deformable headrest <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has a padded portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> which engages the head <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> of the passenger <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. Permanently deformable headrest <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> additionally includes a permanently deformable structure, so that when the passenger&apos;s head <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> is thrown back against headrest <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> during a rear end collision, the permanently deformable structure is permanently deformed in a rearward direction, thereby absorbing the kinetic energy of the passenger&apos;s head <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the permanently deformable structure includes at least one permanently deformable post <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> which mounts headrest <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to vehicle seat <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>. In the shown embodiment, permanently deformable headrest <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is connected to vehicle seat <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> by two permanently deformable support posts <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a side elevation view of the passenger&apos;s head <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> being thrown back in direction <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> against permanently deformable headrest <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> causing headrest <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to bend toward the rear of the vehicle (also in direction <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>). During this process, much of the kinetic energy of the passenger&apos;s head <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> is dissipated or dampened. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a side elevation view of the passenger&apos;s head <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> being thrown forward in direction <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>. Because permanently deformable headrest <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> permanently bent to the rear in direction <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>, the subsequent forward whipping of the passenger&apos;s head <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> in direction <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> is greatly reduced. This substantially lessens the possibility of a whiplash injury. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference> are side and rear elevation views respectively of a second embodiment of the permanently deformable headrest, generally designated as <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. It may be appreciated that the padding which would normally surround headrest <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is not shown so that the internal structure is visable. In this embodiment, the permanently deformable structure includes at least one horizontal permanently deformable member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. For example, the member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> could comprise a rod which spans a distance between two support structures <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> which are mounted on the top of vehicle seat <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>. In the shown preferred embodiment, a plurality of vertically spaced horizontal permanently deformable members <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is a side elevation view of the passenger&apos;s head <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> being thrown back in direction <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> against permanently deformable headrest <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. It can be seen that members <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> have permanently deformed rearwardly due to the force of the passenger&apos;s head <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>, thereby dissipating the kinetic energy of the passenger&apos;s head <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is a side elevation view of the passenger&apos;s head <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> being thrown forward in direction <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>. Because permanently deformable headrest <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, and particularly deformable members <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, permanently bent to the rear in direction <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>, the subsequent forward whipping of the passenger&apos;s head <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> in direction <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> is greatly reduced. This substantially lessens the possibility of a whiplash injury. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is an alternative version of the second embodiment <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the permanently deformable structure includes at least one vertical permanently deformable member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In the shown preferred embodiment, a plurality of horizontally spaced vertical permanently deformable members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is another alternative version of the second embodiment <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the permanently deformable structure includes a sheet <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of permanently deformable material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> is a third alternative version of the second embodiment <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment both horizontal <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and vertical <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> permanently deformable members are utilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the permanently deformable structure of the present invention is fabricated from soft steel, which will permanently deform when subjected to the force of the rearwardly moving head <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> of the passenger. It may be appreciated that other permanently deformable materials could also be employed in the present invention, so long as the material will dissipate a portion of the kinetic energy of the head <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> of the passenger. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> It may also be appreciated that in embodiment <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, the support structure <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> could also be fabricated from permanently deformable material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In terms of use, a method for reducing whiplash in a rear end collision comprises: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> providing a vehicle seat having a top portion; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> providing a passenger sitting in the vehicle seat; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> providing a permanently deformable headrest having a permanently deformable structure; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> installing the permanently deformable headrest on the top portion of the vehicle seat; and, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> involving the vehicle in a rear end collision, so that the passenger&apos;s head is thrown back against the headrest, thereby permanently deforming the headrest in a rearward direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Obviously, after the headrest of the present invention has been bent, it must be replaced. Therefore, the method also includes the steps of: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> removing the deformed headrest from the vehicle seat; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> providing a new permanently deformable headrest; and, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> installing the new permanently deformable headrest on the top portion of the vehicle seat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The preferred embodiments of the invention described herein are exemplary and numerous modifications, dimensional variations, and rearrangements can be readily envisioned to achieve an equivalent result, all of which are intended to be embraced within the scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
