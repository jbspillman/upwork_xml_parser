<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention pertains to the field of sport accessories. More particularly, it pertains to the golf club industry and to a method of applying a unique, long-wearing finish to a golf club shaft and to the remarkable golf club produced thereby. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In the sport of golf it is almost as important to have top quality golf clubs and use top quality golf balls as it is to be competent in hitting and putting the ball. Golf is a pastime where friends meet, business associates conduct business, and athletes and non-athletes attempt to play a round and not have to hit the ball any more often than the experts require, or in other words, not to exceed par. With the social aspects held as important as the athletic aspects, the game emphasizes dress and golf equipment as being as important as ability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In addition to looking good while playing golf, one needs to insure that his or her golf equipment does not fall below a generally accepted level of quality. Clearly, no one wants to play a round of golf in the company of another golfer whose equipment is scarred, dirty, covered with mud, or otherwise in shabby shape. One distinct area of potential damage to golf clubs is in the situation when they are withdrawn from the golf bag and/or inserted. therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> During this activity, the club shafts rub against each other, against the club head, and against the inside of the golf bag. In all cases, the shiny finish on the club shaft is subject to a rubbing action against these hard surfaces. This rubbing action causes blemishes to the shafts and in severe cases scarring that can render the club unsightly and lower the esteem of the golfer. This problem can be cured by placing a textured coating of a very small particle, hardwearing material on the shaft that is hard and long wearing. This way, the damage caused to the club shaft by the activities of withdrawing and replacing the golf club in the bag is greatly ameliorated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Prior art practices in placing such a coat of material on a club shaft has been limited to spraying the finish on the shaft. This is usually accomplished by turning the shaft while the spray gun is coating the shaft with the finish. However, this process is so expensive and fraught with difficulties that it is rarely used. Spraying the finish provides a coating process that is only 25% effective and the other 75% of the finish is lost to the surrounding air and surfaces. In addition, the finish often runs down the shaft during the coating operation causing highlights on the finished club shaft that are unacceptable to the purchasing public. To prevent runs, the painter often places only a very thin coating on the shaft which causes bald areas and areas where the finish is so thin that it crumbles during the first handling of the finished club. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> There has been another coating system used, called the &ldquo;gasket-coating&rdquo; system but it has been used only with smooth coatings and was not thought usable with a coating system containing small discrete particles of hard wearing material. However, using the formulations of coatings available in this invention, the gasket-coating system produces a smooth, full coating of wear-resistant material on the shaft with no bald spots and no runs as occurs with the other coating systems. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> This invention is a method of coating the shaft of a golf club with a smooth layer of curable, wear-resistant liquid material wherein the material is loaded with a high density of extremely small, hard-wearing particles, on the order of 18 to 40 microns in size. The method is accomplished by the steps providing an open-top container, providing a first aperture in an upstanding end wall of the container, inserting an apertured gasket in the first aperture, placing a volume of the liquid coating material in the container, inserting one end of the golf shaft into the apertured gasket, tilting the container slightly to one side so that the depth of the liquid material adjacent the gasket becomes great enough to cover the portion of the golf shaft, and, simultaneously drawing the golf shaft completely through the liquid and the apertured gasket to form the coating on the golf shaft. The method is quick and easy to accomplish and it produces a beautiful, smooth coating of the hard-wearing material over the entire club shaft that will continue to look new and shiny no matter how the shaft is later treated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the main object of this invention is a treatment for a golf club shaft that produces a good looking, long wearing finish that maintains the golf club in prize condition over a long term despite being withdrawn and inserted with other golf clubs in a golf bag or other carrier. Other objects of the invention include a simple method of coating a golf club shaft wherein virtually all of the coating material is used only on the shaft and none is lost to the surroundings as happens with sprayed finishes; a method of coating a golf club wherein the capital investment in such a method is limited to the procuring of a single coating container with a gasket; a method that provides a finish to a golf club without drips or runs that are common with prior art methods of coating; and, a method that does not require significant abilities so as to reduce production costs and lower the cost of the finished article. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> These and other objects of the invention will become more clear when one reads the following specification, taken together with the drawings that are attached hereto. The scope of protection sought by the inventors may be gleaned from a fair reading of the claims that conclude this specification.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Turning now to the drawings wherein elements are identified by numbers and like elements are identified by like numbers throughout the four figures, the method of this invention is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the first step in the method comprises providing an open-top elongated container <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> having a base <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, in this case a semi-round base, including side walls <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, a front container wall <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and an upstanding rear end wall <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, said base <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and walls <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> interconnected along the length of their respective joints to form a leak-proof container cavity <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> capable of holding a volume <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of liquid therein. Rear end wall <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> has a dip or cut-out <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> formed therein as shown. Container <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be made from virtually any material that will hold such a liquid without failure and common aluminum pipe and flat aluminum plate is preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, the next step in the inventive method comprises providing a flexible aperture <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> in upstanding front container end wall <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Aperture <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is preferably formed in a sheet of elastomeric material <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, such as rubber, Neoprene&reg;, and or other such compounds held tightly between two end plates <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> respectively by threaded shafts <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> attached to plate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and extending outward through apertures formed in plate <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and capped by wing nuts <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. Aperture <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is held centrally in a large opening <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> formed through plates <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Aperture <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> should be of a size smaller than the length of a golf club shaft <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> so that it must expand slightly when club shaft <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is passed therethrough to avoid spillage of the liquid in volume <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Shaft <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is usually cylindrical, straight and long and made of fiberglass reinforced epoxy resins, graphite reinforced epoxy resins, steel and the like. Shaft <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> may increase in outside diameter, from one point on the shaft to another, and, in that case, first aperture <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> should be of a size and shape sufficiently large to allow passing therethrough of the largest diameter of shaft <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, the next step in this method comprises placing a volume <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the liquid coating material in container <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in sufficient volume to cover container base <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The coating material useful herein is what is known in the coating industry as a 1-pack epoxy, a 2-pack epoxy, and a 2-pack urethane acrylic and/or polyester coating mix. Also found useful herein is a 1 and 2-pack thermoset plastic (system) and various other high performance resin systems. Each of the materials useful herein are loaded, either when received from the manufacturer, or immediately prior to use, with a density, such as 5 to 12 percent by weight, of extremely small, hard-wearing particles, such as polyurethylene particles 18-40 microns in diameter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Also as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, the next step in this method comprises tilting container <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> such that the level of liquid volume <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> drops below aperture <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and then inserting one end <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of golf shaft <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> into aperture <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, preferably from inside cavity <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, and passing shaft <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> through aperture <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to the outside of container <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In addition, shaft <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is lowered until that part remaining above base <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> enters cut-out <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to bring shaft <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> closer into parallel arrangement with base <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. When shaft <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is of a varying diameter throughout its length, it is preferred that the smallest diameter end be inserted into first aperture <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> first and the largest end allowed to pass through aperture <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> last. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, container <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is then tilted about a pair of mutually outwardly extending side arms <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> on each side of base <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> so that the level of liquid volume <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> moves toward the front end of container <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and covers shaft <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> while it is inserted into aperture <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. In this configuration, golf shaft <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is then slowly passed through aperture <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, from inside container <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and under the surface of volume <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of liquid in cavity <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> to the outside, so that it is coated with the thin, continuous film of curable liquid resin and the excess wiped off by the elastomeric nature of material <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Side arms are placed equidistant from front wall <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> so that container <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> will pivot thereabout along a plane that bisects base <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Shaft <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is then allowed to stand at room temperature to allow the coating to cure into a hardened material. In some cases, the shaft may be subject to an oven treatment to force the coating to cure into a hardened material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been described with reference to a particular embodiment thereof, those skilled in the art will be able to make various modifications to the described embodiment of the invention without departing from the true spirit and scope thereof. It is intended that all combinations of elements and steps which perform substantially the same function in substantially the same way to achieve substantially the same result are within the scope of this invention. </paragraph>
