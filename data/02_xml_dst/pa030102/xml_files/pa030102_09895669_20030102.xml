<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to an adjustable fluid flow regulator, and in particular to an adjustable fluid flow regulator having a finite adjustment limit. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Commercial and Residential gas appliances typically use natural gas or L. P. gas, which are delivered at different pressures. It is desirable to have equipment that can be converted for use with either type of gas, rather than equipment limited in use to just one type of gas. A number of attempts have been made to make an adjustable pressure regulator that is capable of operating within the pressure ranges typical for the two types of gas. Examples of these include Bauman, U.S. Pat. No. 3,747,629; Love, U.S. Pat. No. 4,718,448; Buezis, U.S. Pat. No. 5,435,343; Dalton, U.S. Pat. No. 6,173,775. Most of these devices employ a diaphragm for controlling a valve, a spring for biasing the diaphragm, and a means for varying the spring pressure to adjust the fluid flow regulator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> While the prior adjustable fluid flow regulators are useful for the purposes described, there is still a need to reduce the risk of inadvertent adjustment above the pressure ranges typical for natural gas and L. P. gas, or the specified maximum pressures of the appliance manufacturer. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an adjustable fluid flow regulator construction that can be converted between two modes of operation, but which restricts accidental or inadvertent adjustment above a predetermined maximum limit. The regulator of the present invention comprises a casing having an inlet and an outlet, a diaphragm-operated valve, and a servo-regulator diaphragm. The servo-regulator diaphragm regulates the passage of a control gas pressure that is applied to one side of the diaphragm that operates the valve. The valve opens and closes as the diaphragm moves in response to pressure changes on either side of the diaphragm. By adjusting the servo-regulator diaphragm, the control gas pressure can be adjusted to control the opening of the valve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The adjustable fluid flow regulator further comprises a spring for applying pressure against the servo-regulator diaphragm to control the operation of the valve. A first screw and a second screw are both used to adjustably bias the spring against the servo-regulator diaphragm. The second screw, which engages the spring, is adjustably disposed within the first screw. Initially adjusting the regulator involves fully adjusting the first screw to a limit within the regulator, and subsequently adjusting the second screw until the predetermined maximum regulator setting is obtained. Once the maximum setting adjustment is made, the second screw may be restricted from further adjustment in the field by using a non-standard screw head not adjustable by the public, or by a means of covering the screw. Subsequent adjustment would be limited to the first screw and would not exceed the maximum regulator setting established by the limit.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The gas valve unit incorporating an adjustable fluid flow regulator according to the principles of this invention is indicated generally at <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The gas valve unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is of the type that might be incorporated into a gas furnace, gas boiler, or a gas water heater to provide gas to the burner. The gas valve unit of the present invention typically operates with an inlet pressure range of 7 to 14 inches of water column. However, the adjustable fluid flow regulator of the present invention is not so limited, and can be incorporated into devices for distributing gas to other gas applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The gas valve unit comprises a casing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> having an inlet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and an outlet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a valve chamber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a diaphragm chamber <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> disposed in the casing respectively between the inlet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the outlet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and a servo-diaphragm chamber <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> disposed in the casing. A poppet valve <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in the valve chamber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> controls fluid flow through a passage between the valve chamber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the diaphragm chamber <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The poppet valve thereby controls fluid flow from the inlet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> through the valve chamber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> through the diaphragm chamber <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and to the outlet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. A flexible main diaphragm <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, connected to the poppet valve <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, opens and closes the passage to the diaphragm chamber <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in response to pressure changes on either side of the main diaphragm. The main diaphragm <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> thereby regulates fluid flow into the diaphragm chamber <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and to the outlet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. A first control passage <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> extends from the valve chamber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the side of the main diaphragm <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> opposite the diaphragm chamber, and also extends to the servo-diaphragm chamber <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The control passage <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> allows a control gas pressure to be applied against the main diaphragm at <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to open the poppet valve <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. A second control passage <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> allows the passage of the control gas pressure from the servo-diaphragm chamber <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to the gas valve exit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The servo-diaphragm <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can regulate the opening of the second control passage <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, thereby regulating the amount of control gas pressure in the first control passage <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Regulating the control gas pressure will operate the diaphragm <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to regulate the outlet gas pressure of the gas valve unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The gas valve unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also comprises valve members <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> for closing against valve chamber openings <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, respectively. The valve members <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are held in a closed position by valve springs (not shown), and are opened by a solenoid <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, to allow the gas valve unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to provide gas flow to the regulator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The adjustable regulator section <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the gas valve unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a spring <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> for selectively applying biasing pressure against the servo-diaphragm <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and a means of adjusting the spring pressure comprising a first adjustment member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and a second adjustment member <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The second adjustment member <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is preferably a screw, and is adjustably disposed within the first adjustment member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The first adjustment member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is preferably a screw, and is adjustable relative to the regulator chamber <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The first adjustment screw <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is fully adjusted until it seats against a limit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in the regulator chamber. The second screw <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> engages the spring <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, and is adjusted to the predetermined maximum regulator setting for natural gas, at approximately 3.8 inches of water column. Subsequently the first screw <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is backed off from its fully adjusted position to the nominal regulator setting, at approximately 3.5 inches of water column. Once the adjustments are complete, the opening in the first screw that provides access to the second screw could be covered or plugged to restrict further adjustment of the second screw. A protective cap <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> may optionally be installed to cover the screws <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Conversion from natural gas to L. P. gas involves removing the cap <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, removing the first screw <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> without altering the second screw <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, and replacing the natural gas spring <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> with a corresponding L. P. gas conversion spring (not shown). The first screw <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is reinstalled, with no adjustment made to the second screw <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Adjustments to the regulator setting would be limited to adjusting the first screw only. The L. P. gas conversion spring is configured so that it will not bias the diaphragm above the predetermined maximum regulator setting for L. P. gas of 11.5 inches of water column when the first screw is fully adjusted to limit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Other conditions, however, may affect the regulator setting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> It should be understood that different modifications to the first adjustment screw or the second adjustment screw could yield alternate embodiments that would achieve the same result. In one such embodiment (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>), a second screw <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>modified to include a screw head is fully assembled into the first screw <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and is engaged with the spring. The first screw <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is then adjusted relative to the regulator chamber to the predetermined maximum regulator setting, and subsequently restricted from further adjustment. All regulator settings would then be limited to the modified second adjustment screw, which could not be adjusted beyond the predetermined maximum regulator setting of the first screw. The second screw could also be removed to allow replacement of spring <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> with a corresponding L. P. gas conversion spring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Those skilled in the art will recognize that the inventive adjustable regulator limit of this invention may be useful in many applications and for control of many different types of fluids, and are especially useful for control of gaseous fuel flow. Inasmuch as many modifications within the spirit of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art, the scope of the invention should be determined by reference to the claims appended below and the full scope of equivalents as provided by applicable laws. </paragraph>
