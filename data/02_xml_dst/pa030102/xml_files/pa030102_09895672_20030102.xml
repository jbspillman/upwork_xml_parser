<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to semiconductor device processing and, more particularly, to methods for processing array and support areas of a vertical DRAM cell device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The manufacture and design of integrated circuits has greatly increased in sophistication in recent years, particularly in regard to the increase of integration density. Increased integration density leads to economic advantages as increased numbers of devices and circuits may be placed on a single chip and/or within a single package (which may include a plurality of chips). Performance improvements such as reduced signal propagation time and noise immunity can usually be achieved as integration density is increased due to reduction in length of signal paths, capacitance between connections and the like. This performance gain is particularly important in integrated circuits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Integrated circuits such as dynamic random access memories (DRAMs) can have millions of similar devices on a single chip (often collectively referred to as an array or array portion of the chip design) which are controlled throughout the chip or partitions thereof by circuits such as addressing circuits, sense amplifiers and the like, generally referred to as support circuits. Unfortunately, the circuit requirements are generally different for the array and support regions of the chip, and ideally would require different processes during manufacture. For example, junctions with self-aligned silicides (salicides) are desired in the support regions to minimize series resistance. On the other hand, shallow junctions with low dose implants and no silicides are desired in the array in order to minimize junction leakage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> As another example, during conventional processing of the array, an array top oxide is deposited and certain portions are thereafter removed. Generally, the top oxide is removed entirely from the support area. (See, for example, R. Divakaruni et al. &ldquo;In ULSI Process Integration II&rdquo;, Electrochemical Society Proceeding Vol. &lsqb;2001&rsqb;-2) However, existing wet etch processes may cause shallow trench isolation (STI) areas within the support area to be exposed to overetching thereof which, in turn, may lead to voids at the trench edges, gate shorts and the like. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The foregoing discussed drawbacks and deficiencies of the prior art are overcome or alleviated by a method for processing a semiconductor memory device, the memory device including an array area and a support area thereon. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the method includes removing, from the array area, an initial pad nitride material formed on the device. The initial pad nitride material in the support area, however, is still maintained. Active device areas are then formed within the array area, wherein the initial pad nitride maintained in the support area or the initial nitride layer added helps to protect the support area from chemical mechanical polish or wet etch processes respectively implemented during the formation of active device areas within the array area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the method includes forming a first cap oxide over the support area, the first cap oxide preventing the removal of the initial pad nitride material contained within the support area during the removal of the initial pad nitride material contained within the array area. Following the formation of active device areas within the array area, a cap nitride is formed over the array area. A second cap oxide is formed over the cap nitride, and the initial pad nitride material contained within the support area is removed. The second cap oxide prevents the removal of the cap nitride formed over the array area. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Referring initially to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, there is shown a cross-sectional view of both array and support areas of a DRAM device processed in a conventional manner. In particular, device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes an array area <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a support area <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The array area <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> features the individual memory cells in a DRAM array (the individual cells including a storage capacitor and a MOS transistor). In the embodiment depicted, the storage capacitor and transistor (not shown) for each memory cell is formed within a deep vertical trench (DT) <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in the substrate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. For purposes of illustration, only the topmost portion of the deep trenches <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is shown. A shallow trench isolation (STI) or isolation trench (IT) <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is shown adjacent one of the deep trenches in the array area <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Isolation trench <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> serves to provide isolation between active areas of the DRAM device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In addition, the support area <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> also includes isolation trenches <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to provide isolation between active areas therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In the conventional processing of trench-based DRAM devices, an array top oxide layer (ATO) <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is formed over the wafer. The ATO <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is subsequently removed from the support area <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for further device processing in that area. However, because of the wet etch process conventionally used in removing oxide layers, the isolation trenches <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> within the support area <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (being filled with an oxide material) are also susceptible to wet etching. As a result, a portion of the isolation trench may also be removed, thereby forming a void or divot <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. This, in turn, may ultimately have adverse effects in terms of device shorting, thereby resulting in overall lower device yield. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Therefore, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention, there is disclosed a method for processing a semiconductor memory device, the memory device including an array area and a support area thereon, wherein the removal of a pad nitride from the array area and the support area is processed separately. In so doing, certain aspects of the array processing (e.g., spacer formation within the top portion of the deep trenches) may be carried out, with minimal wet etch exposure of isolation trench regions in the support area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, there is shown a pair of exemplary deep trenches <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> formed within a DRAM array area <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of a semiconductor wafer substrate <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. A thick nitride layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is deposited upon the substrate <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The deep trenches <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are then patterned, etched and filled with a polygate material <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> (e.g., silicon) which material <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is then planarized down to the nitride layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. By way of illustration, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> also shows a bitline junction <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, which is connected to one of the diffusions of the FET structures included in each DRAM memory cell. In addition, a collar oxide <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is located below the transistor portion of deep trenches <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to prevent outward leakage of charge stored within the capacitor (not shown) located in the lower portion of trench <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. A buried strap <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is fabricated early in the process and has a diffused connection formed by creating a sidewall contact on an edge of the trench capacitor. The bitline junction <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, collar oxide <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and buried strap <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> are included in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> to illustrate the general relationship between the transistor and capacitor within the deep trench <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and are not shown in subsequent Figures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Following the formation of trenches <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, a pad nitride <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is then deposited over the entire wafer surface, including the support area <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> of the wafer, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates the shallow trench isolation (STI) formation, within both the array <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and support <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> areas. STI areas <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> are patterned and formed through conventional photolithography techniques, after which portions of the nitride layers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and the substrate <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> are removed by etching to form the isolation trenches <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. After a liner is prepared within the isolation trenches by oxidation, the isolation trenches <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> are then filled with an oxide fill (e.g., a high density plasma (HDP) oxide fill). The isolation trenches <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> extend above the substrate <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, roughly equivalent to the thickness of the nitride and pad nitride layers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Following the formation of the isolation trenches <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, a cover or cap oxide <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is formed over both the support and array areas of the wafer structure. However, the support area <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is then patterned with a photoresist mask (not shown) so that when the cover oxide <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is subsequently wet-etched from the array area <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, the support area <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is still covered with the cover oxide <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. This is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates the removal of the nitride and pad nitride layers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> from the array area <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. It will be noted that the nitride and pad nitride layers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> within the support area <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> are remaining, since they remain covered by cover oxide <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, which resists a nitride stripping process. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, an array top oxide layer <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is deposited and then planarized. The planarization step also removes the cover oxide <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> over the support area <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, thereby exposing the nitride and pad nitride layers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Afterward, an oxide wet etch (with or without a masking step) removes those portions of the array top oxide layer <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> over deep trenches <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. This is done in order to recess some of the polygate material <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> therein, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. Portions of the polygate material <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> are recessed in order for the formation of spacers within the deep trenches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The formation of the spacers <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, preferably silicon nitride (SiN), is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. After deposition, the nitride spacer material is etched anisotropically, thereby resulting in vertical sidewall spacers within the deep trenches <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Once the spacers <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> are formed, the deep trenches <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are filled with additional polygate plug material <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> to define vertical gate contacts therein. The excess polygate plug material <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is then etched back so that it is planarized with respect to the array top oxide layer <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. It should be noted that the spacers <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> may be formed before the formation of the isolation trenches <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> At this point, the nitride and pad nitride layers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> within the support area <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> may now be removed. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, an array cap nitride layer <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> is deposited over the array area <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, extending to a transition region <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> over the isolation trench <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> bordering the array area <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and the support area <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. Then, another cap oxide layer <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is deposited, masked and etched from the support area <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> such that the remaining cap oxide <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> (with pad nitride layer underneath) covers the processed array area <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and into the transition region <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, the nitride and pad nitride layers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> within the support area <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> are etched away. It will be noted that the nitride etch may result in some lateral removal of the array cap nitride layer <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> under cap oxide layer <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Finally, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, DRAM processing may continue with the support area <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. A polysilicon layer <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is deposited over the array and support areas following the removal of the cap oxide layer <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> (and nitride and pad nitride layers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> within support area <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>), implantation of diffusion areas and gate oxidation formation. It will be appreciated that by processing the array area <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> while maintaining the nitride and pad nitride layers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> within the support area <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, the removal of selected areas of top oxide <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and thus formation of the spacers <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> within the deep trenches <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may be carried out. In so doing, the present method allows for minimal wet etch exposure of the isolation trenches <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> in the support area <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. Subsequently, the polysilicon layer <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is eventually removed from the array area <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and the rest of the device processing steps are carried out, as is known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</cross-reference> illustrate an alternative embodiment for the formation of the array top oxide layer <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, after the isolation trenches <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> are defined and processed (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>), the nitride and pad nitride layers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> are etched away. Prior to the deposition of the array top oxide layer <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, however, the spacers <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> are already formed as described above. Then, further array processing steps (e.g., an implantation of dopant species) are carried out, after which a silicon nitride liner <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> is deposited over the array and support areas. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, the array top oxide layer <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is then deposited and planarized down to (or above) the nitride liner <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> atop the isolation trenches <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the support area <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is protected from wet etching since, when the top oxide <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is etched from the support area <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, nitride liner <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> provides an etch stop surface. It will further be appreciated that this embodiment differs from the earlier embodiment, in that nitride liner <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> is present under the array top oxide <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> It should be pointed out that the above-described embodiments of the invention are not limited solely to the fabrication of vertical DRAM cells, or even other types of memory cells for that matter. Rather, the invention embodiments may also be applicable to other types of semiconductor devices having first and second device areas which may be processed differently. For example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> shows a semiconductor device <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> having a first area <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and a second area <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> defined on adjacent regions of a substrate <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. The first area includes a top oxide layer <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> which may be formed and processed similar to the array area of the above-described embodiments. Likewise, the second area <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> may be processed in a similar manner to the support area of the above-described embodiments. A gate material <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> may be found in both the first and second areas <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. In the second area <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, the gate material <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is depicted as a gate, such as for an FET, and is formed over a thin gate oxide <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. Conversely, the gate material <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> in the first area <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, being formed over the array top oxide <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, is obviously not used as a gate for an FET but instead may be used, for example, as part of a wiring level. As such, it can be seen that the aforementioned process descriptions have application in other semiconductor devices, in addition to memory devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been described with reference to a preferred embodiment, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes may be made and equivalents may be substituted for elements thereof without departing from the scope of the invention. In addition, many modifications may be made to adapt a particular situation or material to the teachings of the invention without departing from the essential scope thereof.
