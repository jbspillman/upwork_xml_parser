<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a screening mask for screening patterns on substrates, and more particularly, relates to a screening mask having stress-relieving areas to prolong the life of the screening mask. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In the fabrication of packages for semiconductor devices and the like, it is necessary to deposit finely detailed wiring patterns of conductive material on insulative substrates such as those made from ceramic materials. The conductive patterns typically consist of wiring lines, via, pads and the like. In order to provide these conductive patterns, conductive paste is deposited on the insulative substrate through a screening mask. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Screening masks are typically made of a metallic material such as molybdenum, copper, nickel and the like. However, the material of the screening mask is not important to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> While the specific screening mask material is not germane to the present invention, it must nevertheless be sufficiently robust to withstand the rigors of screening. Screening masks are very thin, typically on the order of 2.5 to 4 mils, and are held in a frame during screening. The screening mask is drawn tight across the frame such that the screening mask is taut and held in tension. The conductive paste that is used for screening is typically very viscous. In one form of screening, so-called extrusion screening, the very viscous conductive paste is extruded through the apertures of the screening mask. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Separating the apertures of the screening masks are tabs which provide structural rigidity to the screening mask. The process of extrusion screening puts tremendous stresses on the screening mask, often causing the tabs to break. When a tab breaks, the screening mask must be discarded. Tab breakage is worst with screening masks having a high density wiring pattern. The pass factor, i.e., the number of substrates screened without breaking a tab, consequently decreases with an increase in wiring pattern density. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A conventional screening mask is disclosed in Comino et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6,095,041, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein. As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> of the reference, the screening mask is principally open for screening of features except for tabs bridging the open features so as to provide structural rigidity to the screening mask. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Randall U.S. Pat. No. 5,763,121, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein, discloses a lithographic stencil mask having a plurality of non-uniformly distributed stress relief openings in the active area of the stencil mask which relieve and equalize tensile stresses within the mask, thereby compensating for any non-uniform distribution of the pattern openings in the stencil mask. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Storm U.S. Pat. No. 6,103,427, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein, discloses a pellicle having a continuous, tortuous path between the interior and exterior of the frame and gasket assembly so as to enable pressure equalization between the two spaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Notwithstanding these advances in the art, there remains a need for a screening mask design which substantially alleviates the problem of tab breakage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is a purpose of the present invention to have a screening mask design which substantially alleviates the problem of tab breakage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> It is another purpose of the present invention to have a screening mask design which has an increased pass factor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> These and other purposes of the present invention will become more apparent after referring to the following description considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Referring to the Figures in more detail, and particularly referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, there is shown a plan view of a frame/mask assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprising a frame <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a screening mask <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The screening mask <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has an inner, active area <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, denoted by dotted lines <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, and an outer, inactive area <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The active area <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the screening mask <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has a pattern consisting of lines <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and vias <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> which is to be replicated in an underlying substrate (not shown). Such an underlying substrate may include, for example, a ceramic greensheet. The pattern may also include other features that are not shown such as pads. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The lines <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> generally consist of apertures or open areas <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> through which a viscous paste is extruded onto the underlying substrate. To provide structural rigidity to the screening mask <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the lines <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> have tabs <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> at predetermined intervals along the length of the lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The pattern is screened by traversing a paste dispenser, schematically illustrated by <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, in the direction of arrows <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The paste is simultaneously dispensed and extruded into the apertures <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of the lines <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and vias <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by paste dispenser <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> As a consequence of the screening operation, certain of the tabs <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be stressed to the point of fracture, thereby rendering the screening mask <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> useless. Accordingly, the present inventors have proposed stress-relieving areas which substantially alleviate the problem of tab breakage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> A preferred embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> where the stress-relieving features comprise apertures <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> separated by tabs <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The apertures <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> preferably are the same size as those making up the lines <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> but could be smaller or larger depending on the circumstances. These stress-relieving features are located in the outer, inactive area <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the screening mask <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and are adjacent to an edge <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the screening mask <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Generally speaking, the apertures <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> from the view shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> appear to be rectangular in shape. It is preferred that the corners of the rectangular apertures are rounded to increase the strength of the tabs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The number and spacing of the stress-relieving features will vary depending on the density of the pattern features. In a preferred embodiment, the stress-relieving features are adjacent to opposed edges <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the screening mask <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Further in the preferred embodiment, the stress-relieving features comprise at least one row, and most preferably more than one row, of alternating apertures <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and tabs <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Most preferably, the apertures <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and tabs <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, respectively, are regularly spaced apart, as also shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In addition to the apertures <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and tabs <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> being regularly spaced apart, it is also most preferred that all of the apertures <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and all of the tabs <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, respectively, are of the same size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> It has been found that in the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the rows of apertures <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and tabs <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are only adjacent to the edges <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> that are parallel to the direction of screening <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, as also shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In operation of the screening mask <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> according to the present invention, paste dispenser <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> moves across the screening mask <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in the direction of arrows <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. During the initial use of the screening mask <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in the screening operation, one or more of the tabs <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> break to relieve the stresses in the screening mask <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. This lets the tension on the mask stabilize at a level such that there is no further breakage of tabs <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in subsequent screening. The end result is that only tabs <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> break, thereby protecting tabs <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in the inner active area <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the screening mask <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> so as to prolong the life of the screening mask <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Tabs <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are essentially sacrificial in nature in that their breakage protects tabs <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> from breaking while not otherwise affecting the performance or utility of the screening mask <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> It has been found that by virtue of the stress-relieving features disclosed herein, the pass factor has been increased approximately 300%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> It will be apparent to those skilled in the art having regard to this disclosure that other modifications of this invention beyond those embodiments specifically described here may be made without departing from the spirit of the invention. Accordingly, such modifications are considered within the scope of the invention as limited solely by the appended claims. </paragraph>
