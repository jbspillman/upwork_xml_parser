<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method for making semiconductor devices, particularly those that include a dual damascene interconnect. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Dual damascene interconnects may enable reliable low cost production of high speed semiconductor devices using sub 0.25 micron process technology. A conventional process for making devices that include such an interconnect includes the following steps. A silicon nitride barrier layer is formed on a substrate, followed by depositing a dielectric layer onto it. A via and trench are then etched into the dielectric layer. A second barrier layer is formed to line the via and trench, followed by filling the via and trench with copper. After applying a chemical mechanical polishing (&ldquo;CMP&rdquo;) step to remove copper from the surface of the dielectric layer, the process is repeated with a layer of silicon nitride being deposited on the copper and the dielectric layer, followed by forming another dielectric layer on top of the silicon nitride layer, and so on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> As device features shrink, the distance between copper lines decreases, creating the need for a dielectric with a lower dielectric constant. Forming the dielectric layer from certain low-k materials serves to reduce the dielectric constant. The presence of silicon nitride, however, dilutes the dielectric constant lowering impact of such low-k materials because silicon nitride (with a relatively high dielectric constant) raises the effective dielectric constant for the intermetal dielectric stack. Using silicon nitride to form the barrier layer is problematic for another reason. The weak copper, silicon nitride interface may adversely affect electromigration performance and reliability. In addition, when using silicon nitride to form the barrier layer, an additional etch, ash, and clean sequence must be added to the process. Such extra process steps are necessary to remove the portion of that layer, which is located at the bottom of the via, to enable the copper that fills the via to contact the underlying copper line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, there is a need for a process for making a semiconductor device that includes a dual damascene interconnect, which has an intermetal dielectric with a lower dielectric constant. There is also a need for such a process that generates a semiconductor device that has a stronger copper/barrier layer interface. The present invention provides such a process.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> An improved method for making a semiconductor device is described. In that method, lower barrier layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is formed on substrate <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, followed by forming first dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> on barrier layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>Substrate <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be any surface, generated when making a semiconductor device, upon which a dielectric layer may be formed. Substrate <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> thus may include, for example, active and passive devices that are formed on a silicon wafer such as transistors, capacitors, resistors, diffused junctions, gate electrodes, local interconnects, etc. . . . Substrate <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> also may include one or more conductive layers that are separated from each other, or from such active and passive devices, by one or more dielectric layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Barrier layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> will serve to prevent an unacceptable amount of copper, or other metal, from diffusing into dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. Barrier layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may also act as an etch stop, protecting an underlying conductive layer during subsequent via and trench etch and cleaning steps. Although conventionally made from silicon nitride, or other materials that can serve such functions (e.g., silicon carbide, silicon oxycarbide or silicon oxynitride), in the method of the present invention barrier layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> preferably comprises a refractory material, such as tantalum, tantalum nitride or titanium nitride. Particularly preferred is a two layer stack that includes an underlying tantalum nitride layer upon which is formed a tantalum layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> When comprising such a two layer stack, a conventional physical vapor deposition (&ldquo;PVD&rdquo;) process may be used to form barrier layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Barrier layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> should be thick enough to perform its diffusion inhibition and etch stop functions, but not so thick that it adversely impacts the overall dielectric characteristics resulting from the combination of barrier layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. To balance these two factors, the thickness of barrier layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> preferably should be less than about 10% of the thickness of dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. In a preferred embodiment, barrier layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> preferably is between about 10 and 50 nanometers thick. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> First dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> may comprise any material that may insulate one conductive layer from another. Preferred are insulating materials with a dielectric constant that is lower than the dielectric constant of silicon dioxide, e.g., porous oxide; carbon or fluorine doped oxide; organic containing silicon oxides; or various polymers. A particularly preferred material for making dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is a fluorosilicate glass (&ldquo;FSG&rdquo;), which may be deposited onto barrier layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> using a conventional high density plasma (&ldquo;HDP&rdquo;) process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> When FSG is used to make dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, the capacitance between various conductive elements that are separated by layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> will be reduced, when compared to the capacitance resulting from use of conventionally used dielectric materials&mdash;such as silicon dioxide. Such reduced capacitance may decrease the RC delay that would otherwise exist and may also decrease undesirable cross-talk between conductive lines. This, in turn, should allow the device to operate at a higher speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> First dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> may alternatively comprise an organic polymer. Such organic polymers include, for example, polyimides, parylenes, polyarylethers, organo-silicones, polynaphthalenes, and polyquinolines, or copolymers thereof. Commercially available polymers sold by Honeywell, Inc., under the trade name FLARE&trade;, and by the Dow Chemical Company, under the trade name SiLK&trade;, may be used to form first dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. When first dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> comprises a polymer, it is preferably formed by spin coating the polymer onto the surface of substrate <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> using conventional equipment and process steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> First dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> may also be made from a compound having the molecular structure Si<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>R<highlight><subscript>z</subscript></highlight>, in which R may be hydrogen, carbon, an aliphatic hydrocarbon or an aromatic hydrocarbon. When &ldquo;R&rdquo; is an alkyl or aryl group, the resulting composition is often referred to as carbon-doped oxide. When first dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> comprises a carbon-doped oxide, dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> preferably includes between about 5 and about 50 atom % carbon. More preferably, such a compound includes about 15 atom % carbon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Examples of other types of materials that may be used to form dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> include aerogel, xerogel, and spin-on-glass (&ldquo;SOG&rdquo;). In addition, dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> may comprise either hydrogen silsesquioxane (&ldquo;HSQ&rdquo;), methyl silsesquioxane (&ldquo;MSQ&rdquo;), or other materials having the molecular structure specified above, which may be coated onto the surface of a semiconductor wafer using a conventional spin coating process. Although spin coating may be a preferred way to form layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> for some materials, for others a plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (&ldquo;PECVD&rdquo;) process may be preferred. First dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> preferably has a thickness of between about 100 and about 2,000 nanometers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment of the present invention described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g, </italic></highlight>dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> comprises a single layer. In alternative embodiments, multiple layers of dielectric material may be deposited to form dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, e.g., to generate a dielectric stack that benefits from the different properties of the different materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> After forming dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> on barrier layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, a series of conventional lithographic, etching and cleaning steps may be applied to produce the structure represented by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>in which via <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and trench <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> have been etched into dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. After the via and trench are etched, barrier layer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is formed, which lines the via and trench bottom and walls. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Barrier layer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> will block diffusion into dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> of copper (or other elements) that will subsequently fill via <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and trench <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Barrier layer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> preferably comprises a refractory material, such as tantalum, tantalum nitride or titanium nitride, but may be made from other materials that can inhibit diffusion of copper into dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. Barrier layer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, like barrier layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, preferably comprises a tantalum nitride, tantalum stack, which may be deposited onto the sides of the via and the trench using essentially the same process used to deposit barrier layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> onto substrate <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Barrier layer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> preferably is between about 10 and 50 nanometers thick (with the tantalum nitride layer preferably being thicker than the overlying tantalum layer), and preferably is formed using a conformal PVD process. (Alternatively, a PECVD process may be used to form barrier layer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> After forming barrier layer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, via <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and trench <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are filled with a conductive material to form conductive layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, which is formed on barrier layers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. This generates the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight>Conductive layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> may be made from materials conventionally used to form conductive layers for semiconductor devices, and is preferably made from copper. When copper forms conductive layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, a conventional copper electroplating process may be used. Such a process typically comprises depositing a barrier layer (e.g., barrier layer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) followed by depositing a seed material (e.g., one made of copper), then performing a copper electroplating process to produce the copper line, as is well known to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In a typical process, after conductive layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is deposited, it is polished, e.g, by applying a CMP step, until its surface is substantially flush with (or recessed slightly below) the surface of dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. (That polishing step may be followed by a standard cleaning step.) In, however, one embodiment of the process of the present invention, a significantly greater amount of conductive layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is removed, without simultaneously removing significant amounts of dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, to form a relatively highly recessed conductive layer within layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> There are many ways to remove additional amounts of conductive layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> without removing a substantial portion of dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. For example, an electropolish process may be applied to generate a recessed conductive layer. Such a process will generally require that electrical contact be maintained to conductive layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment described here, electrical contact may be maintained with conductive layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> because layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is formed on a dissimilar, relatively thin, conductive layer that lines the trench&mdash;i.e., barrier layer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The electropolish process itself is well known to those skilled in the art, consisting essentially of contacting the surface to be polished with an appropriate solution chemistry, then applying an electrical potential to that surface. See, e.g., R. Contolini, A. Bernhardt, and S. Mayer, <highlight><italic>Electrochemical Planarization for Multilevel Metallization, </italic></highlight>J. Electrochem. Soc., Vol. 141, No. 9, pp. 2503-2510 (September 1994). Such a process may enable the controlled, selective removal of copper from the surface of a copper layer. In one example, portions of a copper layer may be removed by exposing that layer&apos;s surface to a phosphoric acid containing solution, then applying an electrical potential of between about 1 and about 1.5V (with respect to a copper reference electrode) for a period of time sufficient to remove the desired amount of copper from the copper layer. The electrical potential may be applied in a steady state fashion, or alternatively, in a dynamic fashion&mdash;e.g., by using pulsed plating. Preferably, current density is maintained between about 15 and about 20 mA/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment of the present invention, conductive layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> must be recessed sufficiently deep into dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to ensure that a subsequently deposited barrier layer will maintain a sufficient thickness to serve as a barrier layer and etch stop, even after the barrier layer has been polished and cleaned. In a preferred embodiment, conductive layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is polished until its upper surface is separated from the surface of dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> by at least about 10 nanometers, and more preferably by at least about 50 nanometers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, a relatively highly recessed conductive layer may be formed by adjusting the parameters applied during the CMP process, such as by enhancing the chemical etch contribution to the polishing process near the end of that treatment. A standard cleaning step may follow such a modified polishing step. Such a recessed conductive layer may also be formed by applying a selective wet etch process (which follows a conventional CMP polish and clean sequence) to etch the copper at a significantly faster rate than it etches dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. Removing a portion of conductive layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> (along with the adjacent part of barrier layer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>), without simultaneously removing a significant portion of dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, produces the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> After forming recessed conductive layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, a two step process may follow to form upper barrier layer <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> to completely encapsulate conductive layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. First, layer <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> (like layer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> preferably a two layer stack comprising a tantalum nitride layer upon which a tantalum layer is formed) is deposited over dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and conductive layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> using, for example, a conventional PVD process. Layer <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> should be deposited at an adequate thickness such that between about 10 and about 50 nanometers of that layer remain on top of conductive layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, after layer <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is removed from the surface of dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. The resulting structure is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>e. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Next, the portions of layer <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> that cover dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> are removed. In a preferred embodiment, those portions are removed using a conventional CMP step. To minimize the degree to which layer <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is etched beneath the surface of dielectric <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, it may be desirable to apply a CMP process that uses a relatively hard polishing pad, and to design the process such that mechanical removal dominates over chemical removal. Reducing recession of layer <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> below dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>&apos;s surface may be necessary to enable layer <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> to perform as an effective barrier layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> After removing layer <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> from dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, the resulting structure includes upper barrier layer <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> formed on conductive layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>f. </italic></highlight>Upper barrier layer <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, like barrier layers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, will serve to prevent an unacceptable amount of copper, or other metal, from diffusing from conductive layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> into any overlying dielectric layer. To perform that function, barrier layer <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> preferably is between about 10 and about 50 nanometers thick. The optimal thickness will, of course, depend upon the thickness required to provide this barrier function for a particular application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> As an alternative to forming a highly recessed conductive layer, then filling the recess with barrier layer <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> to form the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>structure, the following process sequence may be used. Conductive layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is polished and cleaned in the usual way. Barrier layer <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is then deposited on the surface of conductive layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. The portion of barrier layer <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> that covers conductive layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is masked while the portion that covers dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is exposed, using a conventional photolithography process. The exposed portion is then removed, e.g., by applying a conventional dry etch process. Although the resulting structure will include portions of barrier layer <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> that rise above the surface of dielectric layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> (in contrast to the embodiments described above), subsequent processing of the dielectric layer that will be deposited on the barrier layer can eliminate any discontinuity in the surface of that subsequently deposited dielectric layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> After forming upper barrier layer <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, second dielectric layer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> may be deposited on its surface, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>g. </italic></highlight>Layer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, like layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, preferably has a low dielectric constant, and is preferably made from FSG using a HDP process. (A relatively thin undoped silicon dioxide layer, made using a HDP process, may be formed between the FSG layers and the barrier layers&mdash;if desired to minimize reaction between FSG and tantalum.) The same materials, process steps and equipment used to form layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> may be used to form layer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, different materials may be used to form those two layers. In the resulting structure, barrier layers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> completely surround conductive layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. When these layers all comprise a two layer tantalum nitride, tantalum stack, they will serve to reduce the dielectric constant for the intermetal dielectric, when compared to structures that use silicon nitride to form at least one of these barrier layers. After forming layer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, a via (not shown) may be etched through it down to barrier layer <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. The process steps described above may be repeated as necessary to generate a device with the desired number of metal levels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>g, </italic></highlight>the semiconductor device made by this embodiment of the method of the present invention includes the following features. Conductive layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, preferably comprising copper, is formed on lower barrier layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, which in turn is formed on substrate <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Conductive layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is enclosed by barrier layers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The method of the present invention, which forms upper barrier layer <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> from a tantalum nitride, tantalum stack, generates a structure with an intermetal dielectric that has a relatively low dielectric constant, when compared to structures that include a silicon nitride barrier layer. Moreover, by forming a barrier layer that includes these materials, the interface between the conductive layer and the barrier layer is strengthened. Such a method thus enables the resulting device to have improved RC properties, while improving that interface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, when silicon nitride is used to form either barrier layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> or barrier layer <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, it may be necessary to remove the portion of the barrier layer that separates a via from a conductive layer that lies below the via. Such a removal step may be needed to ensure good contact between the conductive layer and the conductive material used to fill the via. In contrast, when the barrier layer is formed from a tantalum nitride, tantalum stack, sufficient contact may result between the conductive material that is deposited on top of that stack and the conductive layer that lies beneath the stack. As a result, when a tantalum nitride, tantalum stack is used to form the barrier layer, extra steps are not required to remove the barrier layer from the bottom of the via. This provides a simplified process, when compared to processes that use silicon nitride to form the barrier layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Features shown in the above referenced drawings are not intended to be drawn to scale, nor are they intended to be shown in precise positional relationship. Additional steps that may be included in the above described method have been omitted as they are not useful to describe aspects of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Although the foregoing description has specified certain steps, materials, and equipment that may be used in such a method to make a semiconductor device, those skilled in the art will appreciate that many modifications and substitutions may be made. Note that although the embodiment described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>shows only one conductive layer, the number of conductive and dielectric layers included in the resulting semiconductor device may vary, as is well known to those skilled in the art. In this regard, the process described above may be repeated to form additional conductive and insulating layers until the desired semiconductor device is produced. Accordingly, it is intended that all such modifications, alterations, substitutions and additions be considered to fall within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. </paragraph>
