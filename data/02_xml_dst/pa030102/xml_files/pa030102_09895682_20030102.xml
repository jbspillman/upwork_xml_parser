<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION AND MATERIAL DISCLOSURE STATEMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a printhead for a thermal ink jet printer, and more particularly, to a thermal ink jet printer printhead with a drop ejector that uses a short plug at the front edge of a forward extended pit in the thick photopolymer layer which in combination with an orientation dependent etched (ODE) channel forms an improved nozzle therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In thermal ink jet printing, droplets of ink are selectively ejected from a plurality of drop ejectors in a printhead. The ejectors are operated in accordance with digital instructions to create a desired image on a print sheet moving past the printhead. The printhead may move back and forth relative to the sheet in a typewriter fashion, or the linear array may be of a size extending across the entire width of a sheet, to place the image on a sheet in a single pass. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The ejectors typically comprise capillary channels, or other ink passageways, which are connected to one or more common ink supply manifolds. Ink is retained within each channel until, in response to an appropriate digital signal, the ink in the channel is rapidly heated by a heating element disposed on a surface within the channel. This rapid vaporization of the ink adjacent the channel creates a bubble which causes a quantity of liquid ink to be ejected through an opening associated with the channel to the print sheet. The process of rapid vaporization creating a bubble is generally known as &ldquo;nucleation.&rdquo; One patent showing the general configuration of a typical ink jet printhead is U.S. Pat. No. 4,774,530, assigned to the assignee in the present application and herein incorporated by reference in its entirety for its teaching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It would be desirable to implement a ink jet printhead which allows usage of a greater variety of inks including viscous inks and to also improve the latency of the ink/printhead combination. This would be desirable so as to open up ink property latitudes so as to allow &ldquo;no-compromise&rdquo; inks and to reduce the drop volume of thermal ink jet drop ejectors. However, given the need for a heater element and the limited volume amount of ink in the channel, it is only a short matter of time before the ink is dried out in the channel. The amount of time before such drying problems become exhibited is referred to as latency. The longer the latency time for a given head design and ink combination the better. It also follows that improving latency for a given head design will also open up the range of inks which can then be employed by that printhead. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Therefore, as discussed above, there exists a need for a design arrangement which will solve the problem of improving latency in thermal ink jet heads and providing a greater latitude in, and variety of, inks. Thus, it would be desirable to solve this and other deficiencies and disadvantages with an improved ink jet printhead apparatus. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a highly simplified perspective view showing the portions of an ejector for a thermal ink jet printhead. Although only one ejector is shown, it will be understood that a practical thermal ink jet printhead will include 40 or more such ejectors, typically spaced at 300 to 1200 ejectors per inch. Illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is the general configuration of what is known as a &ldquo;side-shooter&rdquo; printhead wherein the channels forming the ejectors are created within the plane of the two pieces that form the top and the bottom of the drop ejector. The printhead comprises a heater chip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> including a photopolymer or pit layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, which is in turn bound on a main surface thereof to a &ldquo;channel chip&rdquo; indicated in phantom as <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The heater chip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is generally a semiconductor chip design as known in the art, and defines therein any number of heating elements, such as generally indicated as <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, in a pit formed in the photopolymer layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> with a front edge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. There is typically provided one heating element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for every ejector in the printhead. Adjacent each ejector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> on the main surface of heater chip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is a channel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which is formed by a groove in channel chip <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Channel chip <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be made of any number of ceramic, plastic, or metal materials known in the art. In one embodiment, the channel chip <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed using orientation dependent etching (ODE). When the chip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is abutted against the channel chip <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, each channel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> forms a complete channel with the adjacent surface of the heater chip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and one heating element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> disposes a heating surface on the inside of the channel so formed, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Although the channel and exit nozzle shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> are triangular in shape due to the action of the ODE etching process, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that other embodiments can have some or all of the channel structure formed in the photopolymer layer to form an essentially rectangular cross-section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In operation, an ink supply manifold (not shown) provides liquid ink which fills the capillary channel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> until it is time to eject ink from the channel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> onto a print sheet. In order to eject a droplet of ink from channel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, a voltage is applied to heating element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in heater chip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. As is familiar in the art of ink jet printheads, heating element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is typically polysilicon which is doped to a predetermined sheet resistivity. Because heating element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is essentially a resistor, heating element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> dissipates energy in the form of heat, thereby vaporizing liquid ink immediately adjacent the heating surface. This vaporization creates a bubble of ink vapor within the channel, and the expansion of this bubble in turn causes liquid ink to be expelled out of the channel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and onto a print sheet to form a spot in a desired image being printed. As shown in the view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, it is intended that the ink supply manifold be disposed behind the printhead, so that the ejected ink droplet will be ejected out of the page according to the perspective of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a highly simplified version of a practical thermal ink jet printhead, and any number of ink supply manifolds, intermediate layers, etc., which are not shown, would be provided in a practical printhead. However, it is apparent from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> that the heating element area formed by heating element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> effectively exposed within channel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is substantially rectangular, and two of the four edges of the heating element area are associated with conductors, indicated as <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, which are used to supply energy to the heating element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Further, these conductors <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are disposed in effect parallel to the direction of ink movement through channel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In the present description, the edges of heating element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which are not associated with conductors <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are called first and second &ldquo;lateral&rdquo; edges and indicated as <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> respectively. The heating element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is preferably polysilicon which is uniformly doped from a first lateral edge <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to the second lateral edge <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, all the more to achieve a uniformity of resulting heat generation across the heating element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a depiction of the front face <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the thermal ink jet printhead ejector shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. It is comprised of heater chip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the photopolymer or polyimide pit layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and channel chip <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The front face <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is typically created when the printhead is diced from the forming wafers. The dicing is arranged so as to cut through the channel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and thereby terminate the channel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and thereby create the printhead orifice or droplet emitting nozzle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, there is provided a schematical cross-sectional perspective of the printhead provided in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The general ink flow path for printing is, as indicated by arrows <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and passes under the bypass plug <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, over heater element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and over front edge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> to exit at the emitting nozzle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> on the front face <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the thermal ink jet printhead. A heater element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is typically arranged in the heater chip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> so as to be located between the front edge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and the bypass plug <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Further explanation and discussion of such thermal ink jet printheads is found in U.S. Pat. No. 4,638,337 to Torpey et al. which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for its teaching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows the front face of a thermal ink jet printhead which for all appearances is identical to that provided in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. However, cross-sectioning at section line <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> yields the device depiction found in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> with regards to photopolymer layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the front edge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> has been shifted away from the heater element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and thereby much closer to the front face <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to effectively increase the heater pit size and volume. This creates a hillock <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> which may be as much as nearly 50 microns wide, or more optimally as little as 10 microns wide, where such width is measured from the front edge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> to the front face <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>schematically depict fluid mechanical simulation results for different times following the onset of boiling for an ink jet printhead arrangement as per the invention described above. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>shows the stasis conditions at time zero. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, sufficient current has been applied to heater <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to cause a steam bubble to erupt. In fact, at this point of time at 4.99 microseconds into the simulation, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the bubble grows to the front and back. The front part of the bubble <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is driving a stream <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> of ink past the front face <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and hillock <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, through the nozzle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The back part of the steam bubble <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is pushing some of the ink back to the ink supply though impeded by bypass plug <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>displays the advancement of the stream <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> at a later moment of time in the simulation and that the rearward part of the steam bubble <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> has reached the bypass plug <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and is being further impeded. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, the last of the stream <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is depicted as ending and the beginning of recovery back to stasis has begun. This is more clearly evident in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>where an ingress of air <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> is manifest. One concern with a short wall of photopolymer in the front channel such as is provided with hillock <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is the possibility of air ingestion by the expanding bubble. As can be seen from the above described simulations the bubble stays confined to the long pit section and no ingestion occurs. What will be apparent to one skilled in the art is that the effective enlargement of the heater pit has improved the performance of the ink jet printhead by providing a lower impedance line to the ink flow toward the nozzle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been described in terms of shifting the front edge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> so as to create a hillock <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the teaching of the invention may be more correctly expressed as creating a reservoir of ink in the channel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and more particularly, one which is forward of the heater element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. There are two primary benefits to such an arrangement, first the latency of the printhead is improved because the volume of ink subject to drying is increased thereby increasing the time before dry-out occurs; and secondly the operation of ejecting the ink droplets is enhanced because in essence the effective impedance for the flow of ink or ink bubble from the heater to the nozzle has been reduced. However, there are constraints to achieving such a goal. For example, the heater pit could have been enlarged by shifting outward the first and second lateral edges <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> as found in the photopolymer layer. But there is a necessary pitch constraint for each nozzle which must be respected in order to satisfy the dots per inch specification required to achieve a given printing resolution requirement. Spreading of the lateral edges could lead to violating that pitch constraint and is therefore a less preferred approach than that described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In summary, by sifting the forward edge of the heater pit found in an ink jet printhead a greater reservoir of ink in the channel can be maintained which will improve the latency for that printhead. This can be achieved not only without adverse affect to the printhead but can actually improve the operation by reducing the impedance to the ink at ejection. Such improvements can also allow a greater number of ink types to be utilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> While the embodiments disclosed herein are preferred, it will be appreciated from this teaching that various alternative, modifications, variations or improvements therein may be made by those skilled in the art, which are intended to be encompassed by the following claims: </paragraph>
