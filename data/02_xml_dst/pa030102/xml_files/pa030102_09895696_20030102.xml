<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to the field of semiconductor integrated circuit manufacturing, and more specifically, to a mask for extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Discussion of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Continual improvements in optical lithography have allowed the shrinkage of semiconductor integrated circuits (IC) to produce devices with higher density and better performance. Decreasing the wavelength used for exposure improves resolution and mitigates the effects of diffraction. Deep ultraviolet (DUV) light with a wavelength of 248 or 193 nanometers (nm) is widely used for exposure through a transmissive mask fabricated from a quartz substrate. DUV light with a wavelength of 157 or 126 nm may be used for exposure through a transmissive mask made from Calcium Fluoride. However, Next Generation Lithography (NGL) will be needed to print features with a critical dimension (CD) below 70 run. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> NGL includes many different types of technology, such as EUV lithography, electron projection lithography (EPL), and proximity x-ray lithography (PXL). In order to achieve and sustain volume production, each technology will have to address and resolve many technical challenges, including the following. PXL is constrained by the difficulty of writing 1X-masks. Throughput for EPL is degraded whenever a complementary pattern must be exposed since two passes are inherently required for a stencil mask. EUV masks are expensive to fabricate due to the complexity of the processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> To a large extent, the choice of technology for NGL depends on the desired application. However, EUV lithography appears to be the technology that can best leverage the IC industry&apos;s existing infrastructure in DUV lithography. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> EUV lithography is performed at an incidence angle of about 5 degrees with light having wavelengths of 11-15 nm. The central peak is at about 13.4 nm. Since most condensed materials absorb at EUV wavelengths, a mask for EUV lithography is typically reflective. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) shows a conventional EUV mask <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> with a fixed pattern including a reflective region <highlight><bold>173</bold></highlight> and an anti-reflective region <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) shows a conventional EUV mask <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> that is fabricated on a substrate <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> having a very low coefficient of thermal expansion. First, a multilayer (ML) mirror <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> is formed over the substrate <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. The ML mirror <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> is formed from alternating layers of a high index of refraction material <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, such as 2.8 nm thick Molybdenum, and a low index of refraction material <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, such as 4.1 nm Silicon. Second, an absorber layer <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> is formed over the ML mirror <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. Third, the EUV mask <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is patterned by lithography and etching. The absorber layer <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> is removed in some areas of the EUV mask <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> to form the reflective region <highlight><bold>173</bold></highlight> and left intact in other areas of the EUV mask <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> to form the antireflective region <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> An EUV mask is costly to fabricate partly because defects in the ML mirror cannot be repaired. An advanced IC may be fabricated from about 15-30 lithography layers, of which 2-6 may be considered to be critical. Each lithography layer requires 1-2 masks so mask costs for EUV lithography can quickly become prohibitive. Consequently, reducing the cost of the mask for EUV lithography will increase the competitiveness of this technology for NGL. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In the following description, numerous details, such as specific materials, dimensions, and processes, are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, one skilled in the art will realize that the invention may be practiced without these particular details. In other instances, well-known semiconductor equipment and processes have not been described in particular detail so as to avoid obscuring the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The present invention describes a microelectromechanical system (MEMS) mask for lithography. A conventional mask for lithography is fabricated with a fixed pattern. In contrast, a MEMS mask according to the present invention may be reconfigured to accommodate different layouts for an IC, thus potentially making it unnecessary to fabricate separate masks for each layer of a product. It may become possible to avoid switching masks in a wafer stepper tool to expose different layers of a product, thus improving the consistency of the exposure and increasing the throughput of the tool. A MEMS mask may further be reconfigured to accommodate any design change that is subsequently needed, thus avoiding the time and expense required for fabricating a replacement mask and matching it with the original mask. If desired, a MEMS mask may also be reconfigured to compensate for known variations in the process and the tool. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> A MEMS mask of the claimed invention may be designed to operate in a transmissive mode or a reflective mode. In general, the reflective mode has higher optical efficiency than the transmissive mode. A mask for EUV lithography typically uses the reflective mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> reflective MEMS mask <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> as claimed in the present invention includes a plurality of reflectors. In one embodiment, the reflectors may be arranged in an array. The array of reflectors should have a high optical fill factor, such as 95%, in order to minimize the creation of artifacts between the reflectors when the MEMS mask is in use. Fill factor is determined by the size and spacing of the reflectors within the array. The array of reflectors must also be able to withstand a high optical power density in order to allow sufficiently fast wafer processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Each reflector in the array is individually controlled to be in a reflective state <highlight><bold>273</bold></highlight> or an anti-reflective state <highlight><bold>276</bold></highlight>. A computer may be used to control the array of reflectors. Each reflector resembles a miniature interferometer that can be fabricated using MEMS techniques. In one embodiment, each reflector has two mirrors. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), each reflector has a lower mirror <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. The lower mirror <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is highly reflective. For example, the lower mirror <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> of a MEMS EUV mask may have 40 pairs of alternating layers of molybdenum and silicon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Each reflector also has an upper mirror <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> that is suspended over the lower mirror <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. The upper mirror <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> is partially reflective. For example, the upper mirror <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> of a MEMS EUV mask may have <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> pairs of alternating layers of molybdenum and silicon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The upper mirror <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> that is suspended over the lower mirror <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> may be supported by a membrane <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>. The membrane <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> may be formed from silicon. The membrane <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> will reduce contrast and introduce a phase shift so the optical response of the reflector may have to be tuned by adjusting the reflective height <highlight><bold>373</bold></highlight> and the anti-reflective height <highlight><bold>376</bold></highlight>, an embodiment of which is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The membrane <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> may, in turn, be supported by microsprings <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> which are located between adjacent reflectors. The microsprings <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> may be formed from polysilicon. The membrane <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> and the microsprings <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> should be able to move an upper mirror <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> for more than 10<highlight><superscript>12 </superscript></highlight>switching cycles without any memory effect and without failure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> A gap <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> exists between the top of the lower mirror <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and the bottom of the membrane <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> that is supporting the upper mirror <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. The reflectance of the reflector depends on the size of the gap <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight>. The dependence of reflectance on the gap <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> is substantially periodic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The gap <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> may be controlled electrostatically by applying a voltage to an electrode <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> that is in electrical contact with the lower mirror <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. The applied voltage may be on the order of a few volts, depending on the design. Depending on the polarity selected, the voltage applied to the lower mirror may move the upper mirror relative to the lower mirror. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the upper mirror <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> may be supported by a membrane <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> with a thickness of about 50.0 nm. When no voltage is applied to the lower mirror <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, the upper mirror <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> would be located at a reflective height <highlight><bold>373</bold></highlight>. The gap <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> would be about 9.5 nm or 17.0 nm. For an EUV mask, this corresponds to a reflectance of about 73 percent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> However, when a small positive voltage of the appropriate magnitude is applied to the lower mirror <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, the upper mirror <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> would be attracted closer to the lower mirror <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. Then the upper mirror <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> would be located at an antireflective height <highlight><bold>376</bold></highlight>. The gap <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> would be about 6.5 nm or 13.0 nm. For an EUV mask, this corresponds to a reflectance of about zero percent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> If desired, gray-scale may be accomplished by using the applied voltage to modulate reflectance to a value between the reflective state <highlight><bold>273</bold></highlight> and the antireflective state <highlight><bold>276</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, an array of reflectors may be patterned on top of an array of electronic drivers with control logic. The reflectors may be individually addressed by bitline and wordline and controlled by the drivers in the integrated circuitry. The driver for each reflector would reversibly change the gap between the upper mirror and the lower mirror. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The drivers may be fabricated using CMOS technology. The driver may include an SRAM cell. Signals would control the reflector array through the SRAM array and the control circuits integrated below the reflector array. Each reflector should have a fast response time, such as 15 nanoseconds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> A MEMS mask may be used in an exposure tool to transfer a desired pattern into photoresist (radiation sensitive material) on a wafer. An exposure tool includes an illumination source to provide light energy, an optical package to transfer light energy, and a mask to receive light energy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Exposure tools include steppers (step-and-repeat tools) as well as scanners (step-and-scan tools). The array of reflectors in a MEMS mask may be controlled prior to receiving light energy. This may be done in a stepper. Alternatively, the array of reflectors may be controlled concurrently with the receipt of light energy. Such dynamic control will allow electronic scanning of a pattern that is physically larger than the actual active area of the MEMS mask. This may be done in a scanner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Many embodiments and numerous details have been set forth above in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. One skilled in the art will appreciate that many of the features in one embodiment are equally applicable to other embodiments. One skilled in the art will also appreciate the ability to make various equivalent substitutions for those specific materials, processes, dimensions, concentrations, etc. described herein. It is to be understood that the detailed description of the present invention should be taken as illustrative and not limiting, wherein the scope of the present invention should be determined by the claims that follow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Thus, we have described a MEMS mask for EUV lithography. </paragraph>
