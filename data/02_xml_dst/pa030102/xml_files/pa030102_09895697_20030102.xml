<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to the field of semiconductor integrated circuits, and more specifically, to the ultra large-scale fabrication of submicron transistors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Discussion of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Today literally millions of individual transistors are coupled together to form very large-scale integrated (VLSI) circuits, such as microprocessors, memories, and applications specific integrated circuits (ICs). Presently, the most advanced ICs are made up of approximately three million transistors, such as metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) field effect transistors having gate lengths on the order of 0.5 &mgr;m. In order to continue to increase the complexity and computational power of future integrated circuits, more transistors must be packed into a single IC (i.e., transistor density must increase). Thus, future ultra large-scale integrated (ULSI) circuits will require very short channel transistors with effective gate lengths less than 0.1 &mgr;m. Unfortunately, the structure and method of fabrication of conventional MOS transistors cannot be simply &ldquo;scaled down&rdquo; to produce smaller transistors for higher density integration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The structure of a conventional MOS transistor <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Transistor <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> comprises a gate electrode <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, typically polysilicon, formed on a gate dielectric layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> which in turn is formed on a silicon substrate <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. A pair of source/drain extensions or tip regions <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are formed in the top surface of substrate <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> in alignment with outside edges of gate electrode <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Tip regions <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are typically formed by well-known ion implantation techniques and extend beneath gate electrode <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Formed adjacent to opposite sides of gate electrode <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and over tip regions <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are a pair of sidewall spacers <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. A pair of source/drain regions <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> are then formed, by ion implantation, in substrate <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> substantially in alignment with the outside edges of sidewall spacers <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> As the gate length of transistor <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is scaled down in order to fabricate a smaller transistor, the depth at which tip region <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> extends into substrate <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> must also be scaled down (i.e., decreased) in order to improve punchthrough characteristics of the fabricated transistor. Unfortunately, the length of tip region <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, however, must be larger than 0.07 &mgr;m to insure that the later, heavy dose, deep source/drain implant does not swamp and overwhelm tip region <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Thus, in the fabrication of a small scale transistor with conventional methods, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the tip region <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is both shallow and long. Because tip region <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is both shallow and long, tip region <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> exhibits substantial parasitic resistance. Parasitic resistance adversely effects (reduces) the transistors drive current. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A novel transistor and its method of fabrication is described. In the following description numerous specific details are set forth, such as specific materials, dimension and processes etc., in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be obvious, however, to one skilled in the art that the invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known semiconductor equipment and processes have not been described in particular detail in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The transistor of the present invention includes a silicon on insulator substrate with an ultra thin body of less than 500 nanometers which is ideal for sub-threshold slope and device scalability. Additionally, the transistor channel is formed of intrinsic or undoped epitaxial silicon which provides a transistor with high mobility and minimal threshold voltage (Vt) fluctuation. The present invention includes a polysilicon/mid-gap metal composite gate electrode for pinning the threshold voltage and eliminating poly depletion. Additionally, the CMOS structure can include a raised tip and raised source/drain architecture for low external parasitic resistance. The novel transistor structure of the present invention is ideal for low Vdd (less than 1.0 volts) and low power applications for 70 nanometer technology and beyond. The device has zero poly depletion, ideal sub-threshold slope, zero dopant fluctuation and very low external resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> A novel transistor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in accordance with the present invention, is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Transistor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is formed on an insulating substrate <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. In an embodiment of the present invention, the insulating substrate comprises an oxide film <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, such as silicon dioxide, formed on a monocrystalline silicon substrate <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. In other embodiments the insulating substrate can be other insulating substrates such as, for example, diamond, sapphire, quartz, non conducting polymers, gallium arsinide, and wide band gap semiconductors. Transistor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> includes a very thin intrinsic or undoped epitaxial silicon body or channel <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> formed on insulating substrate <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. The thickness of the intrinsic or undoped silicon body is less than 500 &angst; and preferably less than 100 &angst; and ideally less than 30 &angst;. In an embodiment of the present invention, the thin silicon body is at most very slightly doped to a concentration of less than 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>15 </superscript></highlight>atmos/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>. Ideally, however, intrinsic silicon body is completely undoped and has no carriers other than the intrinsic carriers of approximately than 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>14 </superscript></highlight>atom/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>. A gate dielectric layer <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, such as but not limited to a silicon dioxide film or a silicon oxynitride film, is formed directly onto the top surface <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> of intrinsic silicon body <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. In an embodiment of the present invention, the gate dielectric <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is a nitrided oxide film having a thickness less than 50 &angst; and preferably less than 15 &angst;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> A gate electrode <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is formed directly on gate dielectric layer <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. Gate electrode <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is a composite electrode having a mid-gap work function film <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> formed directly on gate dielectric <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and a heavily doped polysilicon film <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> formed on the midgap work function film <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Mid-gap work function film <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> has a work function close to the mid-gap of silicon (i.e., between the work function of n&plus; ploy (approximately 4.2 eV) and p&plus; poly (approximately 5.2 eV)) and preferably has a work function between 4.65 eV to 4.9 eV. Examples of suitable mid-gap work function films include but are not limited to titanium nitride (TiN), tungsten (W), titanium (Ti), molybdenum (Mo), tantalum (Ta), polycrystalline carbon, and metallic silicides, such as titanium silicide. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the mid-gap work function film is titanium nitride. In an embodiment of the present invention, the mid-gap work function film <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> has a thickness less than 100 &angst; and can have a thickness as thin as one monolayer or about 3-5 &angst;. The polycrystalline silicon film <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> can have a thickness of approximately 1000 &angst;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> A pair of thin sidewall spacers <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> having a width of 100 &angst; or less is formed along opposite sides of gate electrode <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Spacers <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> electrically isolate gate electrode <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> from a doped silicon or silicon alloy film <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> used to form raised tip <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> and raised source/drain contact regions <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>. Sidewall spacers can be formed from a dielectric film, such as but not limited to silicon dioxide and silicon nitride. Transistor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can also include a second pair of sidewall spacers <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> formed adjacent to the outside edges of first sidewall spacers <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>. The second pair of sidewall spacers <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> are wider than the first pair of sidewall spacers <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> and in an embodiment of the present invention have a width of between 500-1500 &angst;. The second pair of sidewall spacers <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> are used to define the raised tip region and the contact regions and can be used to prevent silicide encroachment when forming silicide on the contact regions in a salicide process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Transistor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> includes a pair of source/drain regions <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> formed along opposite sides of intrinsic silicon body or channel <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Each source/drain region <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> includes an ultra shallow tip or extension region <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>, a raised tip or extension region <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>, and a raised contact region <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>. The ultra shallow tip portion <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> is formed of doped epitaxial silicon <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight> formed by out diffusion of dopants into the intrinsic silicon beneath the first pair of sidewall spacers and slightly beneath the outside edges of gate electrode <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The ultra shallow tip regions <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> typically extend at least 100 &angst; beneath (laterally) gate electrode <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> for a transistor with an effective gate length of less than 0.1 microns (or 1000 &angst;). Additionally, ultra shallow tip region <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> has a thickness which extends from beneath gate dielectric <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> to insulating substrate <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. Raised tip region <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> is located beneath second sidewall spacer <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> and is adjacent to the outside edges of first sidewall spacer <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>. Raised tip region <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> is formed of a doped silicon or silicon alloy <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> selectively deposited onto the intrinsic silicon film used to form intrinsic body <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. Additionally, raised tip extension region <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> includes a portion <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight> doped by &ldquo;out diffusing&rdquo; dopants from the selectively deposited silicon or silicon alloy into the underlying intrinsic silicon film. Because a portion of the raised tip region <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> is formed above semiconductor substrate surface <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> on which the gate dielectric layer <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is formed, raised tip region <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> is said to be &ldquo;raised&rdquo;. A raised tip region significantly reduces the parasitic resistance of transistor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and thereby improves its performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Transistor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can also include a pair of source/drain contact regions <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> form adjacent to the outside edge of second sidewall spacers <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. Source/drain contact regions <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> comprise selectively deposited silicon or silicon alloy <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and &ldquo;out diffusion&rdquo; doped intrinsic silicon region <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight>. Source/drain contact regions are raised contact regions. Silicide <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> can preferably be formed on source/drain contact regions <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> in order to help reduce the contact resistance of transistor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Additionally, silicide <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is also preferably formed on silicon or silicon alloy film <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> on gate electrode <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. Both raised contact region <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> and raised tip or extension region <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> and shallow tip region extend down to insulating substrate <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The transistor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of the present invention has high mobility because the channel <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is undoped or intrinsic silicon. Additionally, transistor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> has a very steep sub-threshold slope which gives the transistor good short channel effects which improves the devices scalability. The transistor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of the present invention has a low threshold voltage (Vt) because the channel or body <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> of the transistor is undoped or intrinsic silicon. The use of a mid-gap work function film as the lower layer of the gate electrode has the effect of raising the threshold voltage of the device which is necessary because of the use of intrinsic or undoped silicon for the body. A low threshold voltage is desirable for low operating voltages (Vcc) or less than 1.0 volt and low power operations because the drive current (I<highlight><subscript>d</subscript></highlight>) of transistor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is proportional to the operating voltage (Vcc) minus the threshold voltage (V<highlight><subscript>t</subscript></highlight>). Additionally, because transistor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> has a thin channel body <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, transistor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> has a steep threshold slope which gives the transistor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> a low off current (Ioff). A low off current (Ioff) is necessary to operate a transistor with a low threshold voltage. In current MOS transistors, if V<highlight><subscript>t</subscript></highlight>, is too low the off current is unacceptably high. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the transistor of the present invention does not suffer from threshold voltage fluctuations because of the use of intrinsic silicon or undoped silicon body. Since there are no dopants in the channel region <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> of the device, the dopant concentration from transistor to transistor across the wafer or substrate does not vary and each device has the same threshold voltage which is determined by the type of mid-gap work function metal <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> used in the gate electrode. Additionally, the use of raised tip and raised source/drain contact regions has the effect of making for low external parasitic resistance for the device. It is to be appreciated that if the tip region <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> and the source/drain contact regions <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> were not raised the device would suffer from high parasitic resistance due to the thinness (less than 500 &angst;) of the epitaxial silicon film formed on the insulating substrate. Additionally, because a metal film is used as the lower layer in the gate electrode of the device, the device does not suffer from poly depletion effects. (Poly depletion effects are caused by not having enough dopants in the lower portion of a polysilicon film when polysilicon is used to form the gate electrode of a device). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> As such, the features of the present invention such as a thin channel or body, an intrinsic epitaxial silicon channel, a mid-gap work function gate electrode, raised tip and source/drain contact regions, all work in combination with one another to produce a device which is characterized by high mobility, minimal Vt fluctuation, low external parasitic resistance, no poly depletion, steep sub-threshold slope, and good device scalability making the transistor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of the present invention ideal for use in low voltage and low power operations in 70 nanometer technology and beyond. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>A-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>G is a method of fabricating the transistor of the present invention. The transistor of the present invention is fabricated on an insulating substrate <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>. In an embodiment of the present invention, insulating substrate <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> includes a lower monocrystalline silicon substrate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. Formed on the monocrystalline silicon substrate <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is an insulating oxide <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> having a thickness greater than or equal to 1000 &angst;. Alternatively, insulating substrate <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> can be other types of insulating substrates, such as but not limited to a graphite substrate, a diamond substrate, a sapphire substrate, a quartz substrate, or a gallium arsinide substrate. Formed on top of insulating substrate <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is a thin intrinsic silicon epitaxial film <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>. Intrinsic silicon epitaxial film <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> is formed thin and has a thickness less than 500 &angst; and preferably less than 100 &angst; and ideally less than 30 &angst;. Intrinsic silicon epitaxial film <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> is preferably undoped silicon which has not been intentionally doped with impurities. If intrinsic epitaxial silicon film <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> is doped, it is only very slightly doped to a concentration less than 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>15 </superscript></highlight>atoms/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>. If intrinsic epitaxial silicon layer <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> is slightly doped, it would be doped with a conductivity type with is opposite the conductivity type of which the source/drain regions will be formed. A substrate as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference> having a silicon epitaxial film <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> formed on an oxide <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> is known as a &ldquo;silicon on insulator&rdquo; (SOI) substrate. Intrinsic epitaxial silicon film <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> is used to form the thin body or channel of the transistor of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B, a</cross-reference> gate dielectric layer <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> is formed directly on intrinsic silicon body <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>. In an embodiment of the present invention, gate dielectric layer <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> is a nitrided oxide layer formed to a thickness between 15-30 &angst;. It is to be appreciated that other well-known gate dielectrics, such as oxides, nitrides, and combinations thereof may be utilized, if desired. In an embodiment of the present invention, the gate dielectric is a thermal oxide which is grown by heating the substrate in an oxygen ambient. The thermal oxide is then nitrided utilizing a remote plasma nitridation process. Next, as also shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B, a</cross-reference> metal film <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> having a mid-gap work function is deposited directly onto dielectric layer <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. Mid-gap work function film <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> has a work function between n&plus; polysilicon (4.2 eV) and p&plus; polysilicon (5.2 eV). In an embodiment of the present invention, mid-gap work function film <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> has a work function between 4.65 eV to 4.9 eV. In an embodiment of the present invention, the mid-gap work function film is titanium nitride and can be formed by well-known techniques such as sputtering or chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Other suitable mid-gap work function films include but are not limited to tungsten, titanium, molybdenum, tantalum, and metallic silicides. Mid-gap work function metal <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> is preferably formed to a thickness of less than 100 &angst;. Next, a polycrystalline silicon film <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> is blanket deposited over and directly onto mid-gap work function film <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference>. Polysilicon film <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> can be formed with well-known techniques to a thickness of approximately 1000 &angst;. The polysilicon film <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> can be doped during the deposition (i.e., insitu doped) or can be doped by ion-implanting after the formation of film <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, or can be subsequently doped during the source/drain doping of the transistor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Next, polysilicon film <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, mid-gap work function film <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, and gate dielectric layer <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> are patterned with well-known photolithography and etching techniques to form a gate electrode <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> from polysilicon film <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> and mid-gap work function film <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> It is to be appreciated that other well-known patterning techniques may be utilized to pattern polysilicon film <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> and mid-gap dielectric film <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> including submicronlithography techniques, such as ebeam and x-ray, and sublithographic patterning techniques such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,434,093 entitled INVERTED SPACER TRANSISTOR and assigned to the present assignee. In an embodiment of the present invention, gate electrode <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> has a drawn length (&ldquo;L&rdquo;) of 100 nanometers or less and preferably 70 nanometers or less. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D, a</cross-reference> pair of thin dielectric sidewall spacers <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> are formed on intrinsic silicon film <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> and along opposite sidewalls of gate electrode <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>. Sidewall spacers <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> can be formed to a thickness between 50-150 &angst; with 100 &angst; being preferred. Sidewall spacer <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> can be formed with well-known techniques such as by blanket depositing a dielectric layer used to form the spacers over the entire substrate including intrinsic silicon layer <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> and gate electrode <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> to a thickness desired for the width of the sidewall spacers <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>, and then anisotropically etching the dielectric film to remove the dielectric from horizontal surfaces and leaving sidewall spacers <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> adjacent to laterally opposite sidewalls of gate electrode <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>. It is to be appreciated that spacers <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> must have a width sufficient to electrically isolate a subsequently deposited silicon or silicon alloy film from gate electrode <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. Additionally, the width of the silicon nitride spacers <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> defines the minimum length of the ultra shallow tip portion of the fabricated transistor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment of the present invention, sidewall spacers <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> are formed by a &ldquo;hotwall&rdquo; process to provide a very hermetic seal of gate electrode <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> and the edges of gate dielectric <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. Additionally, although hotwall silicon nitride spacers <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> are preferred in the present invention because of the hermetic seal, any other suitable insulating layer such a deposit oxide can be used, if desired. A silicon nitride layer <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> can be formed by a low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) process by reacting ammonia (NH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>) and dichlorosilane (DCS) at a pressure of approximately 10 pascals and at a temperature of approximately 800&deg; C. A silicon nitride film can be anisotropically etched using chemistry comprising C<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>F<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>and a power of approximately 200 watts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E, a</cross-reference> silicon or silicon alloy film <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is selectively deposited onto intrinsic silicon film <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> adjacent to the outside edges of sidewall spacer <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>. Silicon or silicon alloy film <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is selectively deposited so that it forms only on exposed silicon, such as intrinsic silicon <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> and the top of polysilicon film <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. Silicon or silicon alloy is not deposited onto thin spacers <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>. Thin spacers <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> electrically isolate silicon or silicon alloy film from gate electrode <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>. By forming silicon or silicon alloy film <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> onto intrinsic silicon film <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, silicon or silicon alloy <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is formed above the surface on which gate dielectric layer <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> is formed, a &ldquo;raised&rdquo; tip is formed which increases the conductivity of the tip which in turn improves the device performance. By forming a raised tip in the present invention, shallow tips can be formed and good punchthrough characteristics obtained. The silicon or silicon alloy <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is doped with p type impurities for a PMOS device or with n type impurities for an NMOS device to a concentration level between 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>18 </superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>to 5&times;10<highlight><superscript>20</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>with a concentration of approximately 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>20</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>being preferred. The silicon or silicon alloy can be insitu doped during deposition or subsequently doped by ion implantation. In an embodiment of the present invention, the silicon or silicon alloy <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is epitaxial silicon germanium and is insitu doped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> According to an embodiment of the present invention, silicon or silicon alloy film <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is preferably a silicon germanium semiconductor alloy with germanium comprising approximately 10-50% of the alloy. A silicon germanium semiconductor alloy can be formed by decomposition of approximately 20 sccm of dichlorosilane, approximately 130-180 sccm of 1% hydrogen diluted germanium (GeH<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>) at a temperature of between 600-800&deg; C. with 700&deg; C. being preferred and a power of approximately 20 torrs. If desired, a p type dopant source or an n type dopant source may be included into the gas mix to insitu dope the silicon alloy during deposition. Alternatively, the silicon or silicon alloy can be ion-implanted to the desired conductivity after the deposition of the silicon or silicon alloy film. In order to increase the selectivity of the deposition process, approximately 25-50 sccm of HCo can be added to the gas composition, if desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> A silicon germanium alloy is preferred because it exhibits good selectivity to silicon during deposition. Additionally, such silicon germanium alloy exhibits many microscopic &ldquo;faults&rdquo; and &ldquo;dislocations&rdquo; which aid in the solid state diffusion of dopants through the alloy <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. It is to be appreciated that any silicon or silicon alloy or any semiconductor for that matter which can be selectively deposited can be used to form silicon or silicon alloy <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. For example, silicon or silicon alloy <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> can be selectively deposited polycrystalline silicon formed from dichlorosilane and HCo in an H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>ambient at a temperature between 600-900&deg; C. or can be selectively deposited single crystalline silicon (epitaxial silicon) formed by any well-known technique. Additionally, silicon or silicon alloy film <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> can be a semiconductor such as germanium (Ge). Prior to the selective deposition of silicon or silicon alloy <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> one can utilize a 600-900&deg; C. bake in an H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>ambient to remove native oxides from the exposed silicon/polysilicon areas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> It is to be appreciated that the thickness and doping concentration level of silicon or silicon alloy <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> determines the resistivity of the raised tip portion of the fabricated transistor. A thicker and higher doped silicon or silicon alloy <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> results in a transistor with lower parasitic resistance. An adverse capacitance (i.e., miller capacitance) however, can be developed when opposite voltages are placed on the gate electrode <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> and the silicon or silicon alloy <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. The higher the doping and the thicker the silicon or silicon alloy source/drain regions <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is, the greater is the miller capacitance. Thus, tradeoffs must be made between the transistors parasitic resistance and its miller capacitance. In an embodiment of the present invention, silicon or silicon alloy film <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is formed to a thickness between 500-1000 &angst;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3F, a</cross-reference> pair of thick sidewall spacers <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> are formed on silicon or silicon alloy <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> adjacent to the outside edges of thin sidewall spacers <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> and run along laterally opposite sidewalls of gate electrode <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>. Sidewall spacers <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> are substantially wider than sidewall spacers <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> and have a width of between 500-1800 &angst; with 800 &angst; being preferred. Sidewall spacers <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> are formed from a dielectric material, such as but not limited to silicon nitride or silicon dioxide. Alternatively, spacer <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> can be formed from a composite film comprising a lower oxide layer and a upper nitride layer. The purpose of sidewall spacers <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> is to prevent the encroachment of a subsequently formed silicide on the gate electrode from shorting to the subsequently formed silicide on the source/drain regions. Spacers <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> should be formed wide enough so as to prevent such encroachment during a self-aligned silicide process. Additionally, sidewall spacers <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> can be used to mask a high dose implant to further increase the doping concentration in silicon or silicon alloy <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> in the source/drain contact regions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Next, as also shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>F, dopant impurities in silicon or silicon alloy <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> are diffused out from the silicon or silicon alloy <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and into the intrinsic silicon <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> to form a diffusion doped silicon region <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight>. The out diffusion of impurities from silicon or silicon alloy <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> forms diffusion doped silicon region <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> with a concentration level of approximately equal to the deposited silicon or silicon alloy <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. Impurities are diffused laterally horizontally beneath the first thin sidewall spacers <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> until impurities extend at least 100 &angst; (laterally) beneath the outside edges of gate electrode <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>. The portion of the diffusion doped silicon region <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> which laterally extends beneath the first pair of sidewall spacers <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> and gate electrode <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> is the ultra shallow tip portion <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> of the transistor. It is to be appreciated that the alt diffusion of impurities also diffuses impurities deeper (i.e. vertically) into intrinsic silicon <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>. For each 150 &angst; of lateral diffusion, dopants diffuse about 150 &angst; vertically into intrinsic silicon <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>. In the present invention, impurities are diffused through the entire thickness of intrinsic silicon <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> until oxide layer <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> of insulating substrate <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is reached. In this way the entire intrinsic silicon region <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> in the source/drain regions is formed into out diffusion doped silicon region <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the transistor has a tip with a raised tip portion <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> comprising silicon or silicon alloy <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and out diffusion doped silicon region <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight>. Additionally, the out diffusion creates a transistor having a source/drain contact region <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> comprising silicon or silicon alloy <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and out diffusion doped silicon region <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3F</cross-reference>. Additionally, it is to be appreciated that the remaining intrinsic silicon <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> located between the ultra shallow tip regions <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> forms the channel of the fabricated transistor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment of the present invention, an anneal using a rapid thermal process (RTP) is utilized to diffuse impurities from silicon or silicon alloy <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, into intrinsic silicon <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> to form diffusion doped silicon regions <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight>. In an embodiment of the present invention, the RTP is a two-step rapid-thermal anneal. In the first step the substrate is heated to a temperature of approximately 500 to 700&deg; C., with 600&deg; being preferred in an ambient comprising approximately 5 to 10%t O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>with 10% O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>preferred and 95% to 80% N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, with 90% N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>preferred for approximately 20 to 60 seconds with 30 seconds being preferred. Because oxygen is included in the ambient during the first step of the RTP, a thin oxide capping layer, (not shown) is formed on silicon or silicon alloy <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. The thin oxide capping layer prevents dopant loss (i.e. out diffusion of dopants into the ambient) during the anneal. In this way the doping concentrations of the source/drain regions can be accordingly controlled and low parasitic resistance regions form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> After completion of the first step in the RTP anneal, the ambient is changed to 100% N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and annealing continued for an additional 10 to 40 seconds with 20 seconds preferred at a temperature in the range of 850 to 1500&deg; C. with 950&deg; C. preferred. The second step of the RTP causes diffusion of impurities from silicon or silicon alloy <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> into intrinsic silicon <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> and resultant formation of the source/drain junction. It is to be appreciated that the two steps of the RTP anneal preferably occur insitu (i.e.: the second anneal is done serially with, and in the same chamber as the first anneal step). Additionally any well known rapid thermal annealing equipment, such as but not limited to, an AG Associates Rapid Thermal Processor, can be utilized to conduct the RTP anneal. It its to be appreciated that the RTP anneal process is the only front end (prior to silicide formation) high temperature processor used to activate and drive all of the implants and impurity diffusions in the present invention. No other high temperature furnace anneals are utilized to drive/activate the implanted regions in drive dope and diffusion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Next, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>G, silicide <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> can be formed by a self-aligned silicide process (Salicide) onto deposited silicon alloy <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> adjacent to the outside edge of thick sidewall spacers <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> and on silicon or silicon alloy <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> formed on the top of gate electrode <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>. In one type of silicide process, a titanium layer is first blanket deposited over the entire substrate. The device is then temperature cycled to cause a reaction between the deposited titanium layer and any exposed silicon surfaces (e.g., silicon alloy <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>) to form titanium silicide <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. (i.e. TiSiX) It is to be appreciated titanium does not react with the dielectric sidewall spacers <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>. Next a selective etch is used to remove the unreacted titanium from the sidewall spacers <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> and to leave titanium silicide <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. It is to be appreciated that other refactory metals such as tungsten, nickel, cobalt, and palladium and other processes can be used to form silicide <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. Additionally, it is to be noted that sidewall spacers <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> must be formed thick enough to prevent silicide encroachment from electrically shorting the gate electrode <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> to the source/drain contact regions. Additionally it is to be appreciated that silicide can be selectively deposited onto exposed silicon surfaces instead of using described salicide process if desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> At this point the process for the fabrication of the novel transistor in accordance with the present invention is complete. Conventional well-know processes can now be utilized to interconnect the various transistors formed on substrate <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> into functional circuits to form integrated circuits such as microprocessors memories. </paragraph>
