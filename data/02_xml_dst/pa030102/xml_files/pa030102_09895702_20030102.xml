<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to a disposable cellular telephone and, more particularly, to a disposable cellular telephone that is incorporated into a business card using paper technologies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Discussion of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> As electronics technology advances, electronic devices are generally manufactured in a more cost effective manner so that certain devices can be designed to be disposable. For example, it is known in the art to manufacture cellular telephones and pagers by a process where electrical circuits and related components are patterned and formed on inexpensive substrates, such as paper, making the cellular telephone or pager inexpensive and readily disposable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,965,848 discloses such a disposable cellular telephone and pager. This patent describes a process whereby a strip of a flexible and inexpensive material is printed with a circuit trace in a desirable pattern for a telephone circuit. The strip of material is then folded upon itself to give the cell phone or pager the desired rigidity. The folded assembly is punched to form recesses therein for holding those electrical components that cannot be formed by conductive traces. Additionally, certain integrated circuits that are relatively thin can be deposited on the substrate and be interconnected with the circuit traces in a desirable manner. The folded assembly is then covered with a protective coating, and various other components, such as a key-pad, microphone, speaker and battery are attached to the folded assembly and connected to the circuit in a well known manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> As electronics technology continues to advance, more of the electrical components that go into cellular phones can be made thinner, smaller and more readily disposable. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The following discussion of the embodiments of the invention directed to a business card and cellular telephone combination is merely exemplary in nature, and is in no way intended to limit the invention or its application or uses. For example, the discussion below describes the cellular telephone as being part of a standard business card. However, the invention described herein can be used for disposable cards combined with cellular telephones other than business cards. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a front view, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is back view and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view through line <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> of a business card <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> including a cellular telephone, according to the invention. In one embodiment, the business card <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is the standard length and width (3.5&Prime;&times;2&Prime;) typically used in the industry. However, different size cards can also be used within the scope of the present invention. Further, the thickness of the business card <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may vary from design to design, or vary from the standard business card thickness, to be able to accommodate the various components of the cellular telephone, as will be discussed below. Further, it is envisioned that the business card <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is made out of a durable and flexible paper material suitable for known business cards, where the various electrical circuits of the phone are patterned thereon by suitable technologies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the business card <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is intended to be used to only place outgoing calls, where the cellular telephone will automatically call the number associated with the person or business on the business card <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In other words, by activating the cellular telephone associated with the business card <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the card <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will automatically call a predetermined number, where the user can then talk to the person who is called. Thus, the cellular telephone will not have its own call number, alleviating those concerns associated with the limitations of assigning numbers to a disposable telephone. Additionally, the card <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will not have a key-pad for dialing an outgoing number. The cellular telephone can have a one-time use, or can be a multiple use phone, where the phone can be activated more than once to call the same number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The business card <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a front surface layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a back surface layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> that are two sides of the same paper substrate, or possibly separate paper layers laminated together. In this embodiment, an activation switch <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is formed on the front surface layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at any suitable location, and is a special slidable-type switch that activates the call, instead of a push-type button switch that can be inadvertently activated. The front surface layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> also includes the usual information of the owner of the card, including any type of writing or embossing typically found on business cards. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the business card <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes an input diaphragm <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, acting as the microphone of the telephone, formed on the back surface layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> at one end of the card <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and an output diaphragm <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, acting as the speaker or earphone, formed on the back surface layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> at an opposite end of the card <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, as shown. Both the input diaphragm <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the output diaphragm <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are paper diaphragms attached to the back layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by any suitable device or technique that will allow them to vibrate in response to electrical signals relative to the substrate of the card <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Paper speaker technology of this type exists in the art, and can be miniaturized for the purposes described herein. In an alternate embodiment, the diaphragms <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can be piezoelectric films, known in the art, that vibrate in response to an electrical signal or an acoustical signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Additionally, paper battery technology exists for thin battery cells laminated within a paper substrate. A battery <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> based on this technology is also formed in the back layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> between the input diaphragm <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the output diaphragm <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, as shown. U.S. Pat. No. 5,811,204 discloses a flexible, electrochemical cell for providing battery power, where the cell is made up of a plurality of pole layers, that is suitable for the battery <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The battery <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is located at this position for convenience, however, in other embodiments the battery <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> can be moved to other locations to conform with the configuration and structure of the business card <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The battery <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> would hold enough power for a call of a predetermined duration. Thus, the size of the battery <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> can be selected for that duration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> A printed integrated electrical circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for the cellular telephone is formed on either the front layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or the back layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is printed on one of the layers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in any suitable manner, such as disclosed in the &apos;848 patent, and the other layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is formed over the printed circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to provide protection. In one embodiment, the circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is formed by patterning a conductive ink on the paper layer. Any electrical circuit suitable for a cellular telephone of the type described herein can be used. One example can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 5,875,393. Special electrical connections (not shown) between the circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the battery <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, between the circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the input and the output diaphragms <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and between the circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the switch <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are provided to make the cellular telephone operational. Because the printed circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can be made flexible, the combination of the circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the layers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> could be made in a manner for normal business card use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The cellular telephone business card <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also includes a filament antenna <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> formed within the layers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and electrically coupled to the printed circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in any suitable manner to provide an antenna for the cellular telephone. In this embodiment, the antenna <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> includes an end nub <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> that allows the antenna <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to be retracted from the business card <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, as shown. The antenna <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is shown extracted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and retracted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. In other embodiments, the filament antenna <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can be permanently secured within the card <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to provide the antenna function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The foregoing discussion discloses and describes merely exemplary embodiments of the present invention. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from such discussion, and from the accompanying drawings and claims, that various changes, modifications or variations can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the following claims. </paragraph>
