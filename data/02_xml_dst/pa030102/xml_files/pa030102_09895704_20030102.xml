<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention pertains to offset lithographic printing presses. More specifically, the present invention pertains to lithographic printing presses which utilize ink and a water based fountain solution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Lithographic printing presses employ sets of rollers for applying ink to paper. Paper is fed between a blanket cylinder and an impression cylinder and an impression of wet ink is left on the paper by the blanket cylinder. Prior to contact with the paper, the blanket cylinder is inked by a printing plate which is carried on a plate or master cylinder. The printing plate is inked by a set of inking rollers. Multi-color presses employ a set of inking rollers, a blanket cylinder, an impression cylinder and a master cylinder for each color. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The printing plate which is attached to the master cylinder is chemically treated to provide hydrophilic (water-loving) areas and separate oleophilic (oil-loving) areas. These hydrophilic and oleophilic areas are arranged in patterns to produce a desired printing image on the paper. Ink is attracted to the oleophilic areas and repelled from hydrophilic areas. As the plate cylinder and the printing plate thereon rotates, inking rollers apply ink to the oleophilic areas on the printing plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Printing ink is relatively viscous. For this reason, the printing ink should be applied to the printing plate with a proper amount of fountain solution. Fountain solutions are primarily water mixed with other chemicals. If too much fountain solution is applied to the printing plate, the printed paper may lose color and fade. If an insufficient amount of fountain solution is applied to the printing plate, print clarity may be reduced and print may appear in unwanted areas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> There are generally two types of dampening systems for applying fountain solution to the printing plate. One type of dampening system applies the fountain solution directly to the printing plate with a separate set of dampening rollers. The other type of dampening system applies the fountain solution to the printing plate indirectly through the ink. The ink on the inking rollers is dampened with the fountain solution before it is applied to the printing plate. This type of system is sometimes referred to as an integrated system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In prior art systems in which a fountain solution is applied directly to the printing plate by a separate set of dampening rollers, a dampening form roller applies the fountain solution to the printing plate prior to ink being applied thereto by the set of inking rollers. In dampening systems which apply fountain solution directly to the printing plate prior to ink being applied thereto, streaking sometimes occurs in the printed areas because the fountain solution is unevenly distributed on the printing plate. Improvements in systems of this type are needed. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides apparatus for an offset lithographic printing press employing a dampening system of the type which applies the fountain solution directly to the printing plate with a separate set of dampening rollers. It provides a set of dampening rollers having at least one dampening form roller which engages the printing plate and a separate set of inking rollers which provides at least one ink form roller which engages the printing plate. An important feature of the present invention is the arrangement of the set of dampening rollers so that the dampening form roller engages the printing plate after engagement of the printing plate by the ink form roller but applying fountain solution to the printing plate prior to engagement of the printing plate with the blanket cylinder. This distinguishes the present invention from the prior art in which the fountain solution is applied to the printing plate prior to ink being applied thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> There are several objects and benefits of the system of the present invention. First and foremost, it provides greater clarity of print than prior art systems which apply the fountain solution directly to the printing plate prior to ink being applied thereto. It results in better balance between the fountain solution and ink. It requires less fountain solution and increases the ability to lay down more ink and to lay larger and better ink solids. Furthermore, the improved printing made possible by the system of the present invention could result in reduction of the number of dampening rollers and ink rollers and, consequently, reduce the overall cost of the printing press. Other objects and advantages of the invention will be apparent from reading the description which follows in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<detailed-description>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Referring first to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, there is shown a schematic end view of rollers in a lithographic printing press for applying a single color, such as black, to paper. The impression which is to be printed on the paper is formed on a blanket cylinder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by engagement with a printing plate carried on the master or plate cylinder <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The paper is fed between the blanket cylinder and an impression cylinder (not shown) where the impression is transferred from the blanket cylinder to the paper. The prior art system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> provides a reservoir of ink <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and a set of ink rollers <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. These rollers are called by various names. For the present purposes it is only necessary to designate rollers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> as ink form rollers. The ink form rollers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> apply ink to the outer surface of the printing plate carried on the plate carried on master cylinder <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. One of the inking rollers <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> acquires ink on its outer surface from an ink reservoir <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and ink is applied to the other rollers <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by rotative contact therewith. This smooths the ink and finally when the ink is applied to the printing plate by the ink form rollers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> it is applied in a smooth even layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The fountain solution is carried in a fountain solution reservoir <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and is picked up on a dampening roller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which is partially submerged therein. The fountain solution is then distributed by rotative contact with rollers <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> being finally evenly distributed to the dampening form roller <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> which applies the fountain solution to the master cylinder printing plate. It is again noted that the fountain solution is applied to the printing plate prior to ink being applied thereto by the ink form rollers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Thus, the fountain solution is attracted to the printing plate by the hydrophilic areas thereon. Subsequently the ink is attracted to the oleophilic areas of the printing plate by the ink form rollers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, there is shown a schematic end view of rollers of a lithographic printing press according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The system utilizes the same master or plate cylinder <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and blanket cylinder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as in the prior art system of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. There is also very little difference in the inking system. There is an ink reservoir <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, inking rollers <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. The rollers <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> are ink form rollers, similar to ink form rollers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, which apply ink to the oleophilic areas of the printing plate carried on the master or plate cylinder <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The major difference between the system of the present invention and that of the prior art is in the dampening system. The dampening system of the present invention provides a dampening form roller <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> which engages the printing plate carried on the master cylinder <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> after the printing plate has been engaged by the ink form rollers <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and prior to engagement of the printing plate with the blanket cylinder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Thus, ink is applied to the printing plate first and then fountain solution is applied to the printing plate subsequently thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The dampening system includes a reservoir of fountain solution <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in which the dampening form roller <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is partially submerged for rotation therein. A metering roller <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> engages the surface of the dampening roller <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> after it emerges from the reservoir <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to regulate the amount of fountain solution applied to the printing plate by the dampening form roller <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The dampening form roller <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> rotates about a shaft <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> on which is mounted a gear (not shown) for engagement with a gear carried by the master cylinder <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (not shown). The metering roller <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is mounted on a central shaft <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> the ends of which may be supported by bearings (not shown) which may be moved closer to or further away from the dampening form roller <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to regulate the flow of fountain solution to the printing plate. A third roller <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> engages the surface of the metering roller <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The roller <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> may be mounted on a shaft <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> operatively associated with what is sometimes referred to as a &ldquo;worm and dog&rdquo; mechanism (not shown) which causes the roller <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> to oscillate on the axis of the shaft <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to aid in evenly spreading the fountain solution on the metering roller <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and consequently on the dampening form roller <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The outer surfaces of the metering roller <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are harder than the outer surfaces of the form roller <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the third roller <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. It will be noted that the dampening form roller <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, the rollers <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and the reservoir of fountain solution <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are all at a lower elevation than the set of inking rollers <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In summary, the operation of the system of the present invention is as follows. A lithographic printing plate, chemically treated with hydrophilic and oleophilic areas, is attached to the master cylinder <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. As the master cylinder <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> rotates, in a counter clockwise manner, ink is applied to oleophilic areas of the printing plate by form rollers <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> which are supplied with ink from ink reservoir <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and ink rollers <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> As the master cylinder <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> continues to rotate, fountain solution is applied to hydrophilic areas of the printing plate carried by the master cylinder <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by dampening form roller <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The dampening form roller <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, rotating clockwise, is partially immersed in the fountain solution reservoir <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The metering roller, which is harder than roller <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, fictionally engages the dampening form roller <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, in effect, squeezing the surface of roller <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to regulate the amount of fountain solution which is applied to the hydrophilic areas of the printing plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The amount of fountain solution can be regulated by moving the shaft <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of the metering roller closer to (for less solution) or further from (for more solution) the shaft <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the form roller <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. As previously mentioned, this can be accomplished by moving the bearings (not shown) in which the ends of shaft <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are carried closer to or further away from the shaft <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of dampening form roller <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The roller <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> frictionally engages the metering roller <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, rotating therewith but in the opposite direction. At the same time, it also axially oscillates helping to evenly spread fountain solution on metering roller <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and dampening form roller <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> As the master cylinder <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> continues to rotate, the printing plate carried thereby, with both ink and fountain solution applied thereto, engages the blanket cylinder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> leaving an inked print image thereon. Paper (not shown) is fed between the blanket cylinder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and an impression cylinder (not shown) adjacent thereto. An impression of wet ink is left on the paper by the blanket cylinder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The cycle is then repeated with the printing plate again receiving ink from the ink form rollers <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, fountain solution from dampening form roller <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and paper receiving wet ink from blanket roller <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> As stated, the system of the present invention provides greater clarity of print and increases the ability to lay down more ink. It could also allow a reduction in the number of ink and dampening rollers, resulting in a printing press of reduced cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> A single embodiment of the present invention has been described herein. However, many variations of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the printing art. Accordingly, it is intended that the scope of the invention be limited only by the claims which follow. </paragraph>
