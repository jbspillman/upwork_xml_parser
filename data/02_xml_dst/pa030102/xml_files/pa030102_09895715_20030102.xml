<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to exercise devices, specifically an out of water type swimming exercise device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Major fitness activities such as running, cycling, rowing and cross-country skiing all have exercise equipment that allow for performance of the activity inside one&apos;s own home or at the local health club. Swimming enjoys a large participation share yet there is no commercially available indoor exercise equipment to simulate it. While numerous patents are documented in the out of water type swimming field, a search of the local fitness equipment dealer will not result in a device that can be purchased, proving the failure of prior art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Typical prior art has proven to be cumbersome and inconvenient. Most attempts have sought to incorporate pulleys and cables for both the arm and leg motions of swimming. Pulleys and cables have failed to provide consistent resistance throughout the simulated swimming stroke. U.S. Pat. No. 5,269,736 to Roberts (1993) deviated from pulleys and cables and employs a pedal mechanism for the arm motion that is operated by the hands. While this pedal mechanism is proven and widely used in the stationary bicycle field, it has a fixed path of operation that fails to provide for the full asymmetrical motion of the arms in a simulated swimming stroke. Additionally, U.S. Pat. No. 4,674,740 to lams and Splane (1987) uses a novel approach beyond cables that employs telescopic crank arms with resistance from a cam-and-belt mechanism. The intent is to simulate the &ldquo;water line&rdquo; and provide the corresponding resistances and reciprocal motions of actual swimming. In reality, significant resistance under the water line and minimal resistance above the water line requires advanced coordination obtained only through extensive practice. The first time user of this configuration finds it awkward and is quick to abort the exercise. Likewise, U.S. Pat. No. 4,830,363 to Kennedy (1989) deviated from pulleys and cables and employs cushioned leg rolls with hydraulic shocks for the leg motion of the exercise. While this cushioned leg roll approach is proven and widely used in the leg extension/flexion field of weight lifting, the hydraulic shocks have a slow response rate that significantly prohibits the simulation of a swimming flutter kick. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, convenience and consistent resistance with electronic control are advantages of my invention. My swim machine combines a pedal mechanism with a telescopic crank for the arm movements of the exercise. Left and right telescopic cranks are attached to the pedal mechanism by means of two universal joints. The universal joints and the telescopic cranks allow for the infinite range of arm motions in any plane. The pedal mechanism provides for adjustable continuous resistance that allows the user to select any level of physical exertion desired. The greater the resistance, the more difficult the exercise is to perform and the greater the physiological benefits. For the leg motion, my invention utilizes cushioned leg rolls attached to pivoting lever bars. The leg portion also provides for adjustable continuous resistance that allows the user to select any level of physical exertion desired. The arm and leg mechanisms of my invention are supported on an adjustable height and length exercise bench. Convenience is found in the fact that the user simply lies on a bench, grasps the handles of the telescopic cranks and engages the legs with the cushioned rolls to begin exercising. A keyboard and display panel used to communicate between a microcomputer and alternators of the arm and leg mechanisms provides for the user to select from a plurality of stored programs or generate a random program. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> To begin the freestyle swim stroke, the hands must be 180 degrees from each other with one hand extended forward and the second hand to the rear by the hip. The user can now perform the windmill motion of the stroke along with the alternating flutter kick. The telescopic cranks and universal joints allow for the asymmetrical rotation of the swim stroke while providing continuous resistance from the pedal mechanism. Further, the bench allows for the tilt of the user&apos;s torso during the swim stroke by providing a pair of swivel joints. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In the backstroke, the user sits down and leans back onto the hinged bench, which can be inclined and performs the windmill motion of the arms along with the alternating flutter kick. Again, the swivel joints allow for the tilt of the user&apos;s torso during the swim stroke. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The butterfly swim stroke can also be performed. In this case both hands must be at the same angle from the body and extended forward. Likewise, both legs are adjacent to each other by locking the pivoting lever bars together. The arms and legs work in synchronization to each other throughout the windmill motion and the dolphin kick. The seat allows for the up and down movement of the user&apos;s hips by employing a swivel joint. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> This out of water swimming exercise device is advantageous over water swimming in that it avoids the dry/itchy skin and damaged/brittle hair that is so common from the chemicals used in swimming pools. Additionally, the out of water usage allows for performance of the exercise in the privacy of one&apos;s own home, thereby avoiding the embarrassment that some individuals have with being seen by others in form fitting swimwear. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> When comparing fitness activities for number of calories burned, swimming ranks high on the list. An exercise device that allows an individual to swim all year round, despite the availability of a pool or favorable climate, provides a benefit that cannot be ignored. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A May 1999 study conducted by American Sports Data for the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association found that there are 80,864,000 recreational walkers in the United States, 54,575,000 recreational bicyclers and 94,371,000 recreational swimmers. The same study also found that there are 37,073,000 treadmill users, 30,791,000 stationary cycle users and zero swim machine users. The number of treadmill users translates to forty-six percent of walkers and the stationary cyclers translates to fifty-six percent of bicyclers. Averaging these two percentages allows for extrapolation of 48,327,000 potential users of a swim machine. This number represents a significant target market. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A general object of the present invention is to provide an improved exercise apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the invention to provide an exercise apparatus, which provides a scientifically maximum exercise benefit within the minimum amount of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the invention to provide an improved exercise apparatus, which motivates the user to improve his/her progress. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the invention to provide an exercise apparatus, which is convenient to use both in time and in place. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the invention to provide an exercise apparatus in which the progress of the user is easily measured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the invention to provide an exercise apparatus where the user&apos;s work level can be easily measured whereby the user&apos;s maximal oxygen uptake can be calculated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the invention to provide an exercise apparatus, which allows the user to maintain an identical work effort from day to day. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the invention to provide an exercise apparatus, which automatically provides interval training with progressive overload. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In the following description similar features in the drawing were given similar numerals. While the invention to be described is in conjunction with a preferred embodiment, it will be understood that it is not intended to limit the invention to such embodiment. On the contrary, it is intended to cover all alternatives, modifications and equivalents as may be included within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> there is illustrated a swim machine in accordance with the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The apparatus comprises two separate benches to support a user, the torso frame <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and seat frame <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The torso bench is supported above the floor by a torso base <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, torso front foot <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and torso rear foot <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> with a combination of front and rear sleeves <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and inserts <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The front and rear sleeves are connected by transverse bar <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The height of the bench is adjusted by set pins <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> through sleeve location holes <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and into corresponding insert adjustment holes <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The seat frame is supported above the floor by a seat base <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, seat front foot <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and seat rear foot <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> with a seat sleeve <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and seat insert <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. The height of the seat is adjusted by set pin <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> through sleeve location hole <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and into corresponding insert adjustment holes <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Each of the torso and seat frames is covered by a cushioned board <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, which serves as the user contact surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The tubing of the frame, base, feet, sleeves and inserts may have any suitable cross-sectional shape including square or circular. Further, the tubing is not intended to be limited by a particular material of construction. Any material that can withstand the rigors of operation may be utilized. Suitable materials include metals, alloys, high strength plastics, and fiber-reinforced materials such as graphite reinforced plastic materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Torso and seat cushions are preferably constructed of materials suitable to endure the rigors of exercise use to which they will be subjected. Suitable materials include open cell foam, closed cell foam, sponge rubber and gel filled materials. Typically the cushion is covered with plastic, vinyl or other material suitable to withstand repeated and prolonged exposure to perspiration. Torso and seat boards can be various shapes including angled corners, rounded corners and custom fit for user&apos;s arm clearance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> A combination of torso swivel joint <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, incline swivel joint <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and ball and socket joint <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> allow for axial rotation of the torso bench which is critical to simulate the natural shoulder rotation of the freestyle swim stroke. Torso swivel joint <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is attached to the rear insert <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and to the torso frame <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Incline swivel joint <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is attached to the incline insert <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and to the incline hinge <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Ball and socket joint <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> has the ball on the top of the front insert <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the socket on the bottom of the torso frame <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> A seat swivel joint <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is attached to the seat insert <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and to the seat frame <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> which allows for the seat to pivot which is critical to the natural dolphin like hip motion of the breast stroke. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> A torso hinge <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and incline hinge <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> allow for the torso bench to be inclined to aid in television viewing during the back stroke. The bench is supported in the incline mode by an incline sleeve <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and insert <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> that is adjustable by using set pin <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in sleeve location hole <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> into corresponding insert adjustment holes <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The incline sleeve <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is connected to transverse bar <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> by incline bracket <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. Incline dowel <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is inserted through one side of incline bracket <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, passes through incline sleeve <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, and finishes through the second side of incline bracket <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. This dowel allows for the sleeve and insert to pivot with the inclining of the bench. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Adjusting the distance between the torso bench and the seat provides for the height of a user. Set pin <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is placed in sleeve location hole <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of torso/seat link sleeve <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and into a corresponding insert adjustment hole <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of torso/seat link insert <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Pedal mechanism <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is a conventional pedal crank assembly and is mounted underneath torso frame <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. This pedal mechanism is rotated by two non-conventional telescopic arm cranks <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> attached to the pedal mechanism drive sprocket <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> at each end by universal joints <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. Telescopic arm cranks <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> terminate at their outward end in multi-motion apparatus <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> to which is attached handgrip <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Telescopic arm cranks <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are constructed of three or more telescoping sections <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. The telescoping feature allows the arm cranks length to vary as the user moves his arms in the natural swimming motion. Thus, the normal arm strokes of swimming can be properly simulated, rather than having the user&apos;s arms artificially forced to maintain a fixed extension in the manner of many prior art devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The handgrips <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can be as shown in the form of rotatable rods which are actually gripped by the user. Alternatively, the handgrips <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> could be in the form of flat pads on which the user lays his hands to give more of the simulation of the extended hand position common to swimming. A strap or similar restraining device would secure the user&apos;s hand to the &lsquo;paddle type&rsquo; handgrips <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. In an alternative but less preferred embodiment the handgrip <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> could be in the form of a glove or mitten in which the user places his hands. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The details of the different degrees of motion available for the user&apos;s arms in multi-motion apparatus <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The telescoping relationship of arm cranks <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> sections <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>allow for extension and retraction of the arm crank <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> as indicated by arrow <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. Handgrip <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is rotatably mounted on shaft <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> providing for rotational motion as indicated by arrow <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. The inward end of shaft <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> terminates in a swivel joint formed by tongue <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> being fitted in slot <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and pinned by bolt <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, thus permitting the swivel motion indicated by arrow <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. Tongue <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> in turn is fixed to sleeve <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> which is slidably mounted on arm crank section <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and is restrained at the outward end by stop <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. Sleeve <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> provides for sliding motion indicated by arrow <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and rotational motion as indicated by arrow <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> This multi-dimensional freedom of motion imparted by apparatus <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> allows the user to simulate the proper motion of swimming. Not only do the user&apos;s arms move at the shoulder correctly and extend and retract at the appropriate points in the stroke, but also the user can rotate his wrist as necessarily occurs during the normal upward portion of the swimming stroke, without releasing his grip or position on handgrips <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The details of the pedal mechanism are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. Movement of telescopic arm cranks <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> rotates pedal mechanism drive sprocket <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, which causes a chain <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> to drive a small diameter sprocket <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> attached to a flywheel <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The variable load which the operator must overcome in order to rotate sprocket <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is preferably generated by an alternator <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, which provides a variable resistance to the operator&apos;s effort through its driving connection with flywheel <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> by a gear belt <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. The alternator is of the known variety&mdash;being a generator with an electromagnet therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The present invention is not intended to be limited to any one type of variable load. Alternately, the variable load could be provided by frictional force, hydraulic fluid, gas, disc-braking band, edge engaging braking roller, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> While not shown, it is envisioned that the chain and gears of pedal mechanism <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and alternator <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> would be covered by a housing for neatness of appearance, acoustic insulation, and safety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Again, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> there is illustrated a swim machine in accordance with the present invention that employs a stair climber mechanism <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> for simulating the leg motions of swimming. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Plate <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is attached to seat base <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and seat sleeve <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> with stability provided by tubular member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. As will be described, many of the various stair climber components are mounted on the plate. The central location of the components, between the legs of the user, provides stability to the apparatus and allows for a lightweight and simple design. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Operation of right and left leg levers is identical and will only be described once. Sleeves <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and inserts <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> are on opposite sides of the plate <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and pivotally mounted to seat base <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> by leg lever dowel <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. The length of the leg levers is adjusted by set pins <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> through sleeve location holes <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and into corresponding insert adjustment holes <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The user&apos;s legs engage the leg levers by cushioned rolls <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> rotatably mounted to foot swivel bracket <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> by cushioned roll dowels <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. Foot swivel bracket <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> is pivotally mounted to leg levers by foot swivel dowel <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. Pivoting of the foot swivel bracket allows for the distance between cushioned rolls to conform to the thickness of the user&apos;s leg. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> A leg lever link <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> allows for locking the leg levers together when performing the dolphin kick of the butterfly stroke. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The details of the stair climber mechanism are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>. One end of a right chain <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is attached to winglet <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> that extends from the right leg lever sleeve <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. The chain <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is made to pass over and drivingly engage the teeth of a right sprocket <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> which is part of a drive system assembly <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>, best seen in cross-section in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. The chain is connected at its other end to a spring <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> by a connector <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>. The spring travels over a guide sheave or pulley wheel <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> rotatably mounted on the plate and terminates at a hanger <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> secured to the plate <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. The spring <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, attached to the chain <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, and, in turn, attached to the leg lever <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, is of sufficient tension to keep the lever in the upright position when not in use. The lever will be raised until the winglet <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> rests against a stop <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> welded to the plate <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> When the user kicks downward, the spring will stretch to allow the chain to move over the right sprocket and allow the lever to move downward toward the floor. When the user&apos;s leg is lifted, the spring will cause the lever to return to the upright position. The kicking motion of the exerciser, thus, activates the leg lever. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The drive system assembly <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>, seen in detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, includes a central driveshaft <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> having a drive sprocket <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> welded thereto. Surrounding the shaft are left and right sprockets <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. The sprockets operate in conjunction with clutch bearings <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. When the sprocket turns counterclockwise, the sprocket <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and clutch bearings <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> positively lock with the shaft <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> to turn the shaft counterclockwise. This occurs when the right lever is being depressed. Thus, when the shaft <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> is rotated counterclockwise, the drive sprocket <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> will likewise be rotated counterclockwise. When the right sprocket is turned clockwise (when the right lever is returning to position at rest), the right sprocket and clutch bearing will overrun so that the shaft <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> and the drive sprocket <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> remain stationary. Thus, torque is transmitted to the shaft and drive sprocket in one direction only. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The drive system assembly <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> is secured by a hub <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> to the plate <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> with bolts <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. Pin bearings <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> separate the hub from the shaft. A snap ring <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> is on the end of the shaft opposite the drive sprocket <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. A separator series <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> comprising a thrust washer <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> thrust bearing <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> and thrust washer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> surrounds the shaft. A separator series <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> separates the snap ring <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> from the left sprocket <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, the left sprocket from the hub <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight>, the hub from the right sprocket <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, and the right sprocket from the drive sprocket <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> It is important to note that left and right sprockets <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> operate independently of each other, resulting in independent operation of the left and right leg levers. The asymmetrical range of motion of the levers is desirable, particularly in rehabilitation and medical applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference> illustrate the drive system assembly operation. When either the left or right leg lever is depressed, the driveshaft <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> will be rotated counterclockwise. Continuous chain <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is engaged with the teeth of the drive sprocket <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and engaged with the teeth of a transmission sprocket <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The transmission sprocket <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> rotates an input shaft <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> of a transmission <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> secured on side to the plate <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. The transmission contains a series of gears (not shown) which act as a speed increaser. An output shaft <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> extends from the transmission on the opposite side from the input shaft <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and terminates in a transmission tooth pulley <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. By way of example and not by way of limitation, the output shaft <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> will rotate at twenty times the speed of the input shaft <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> An alternator <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is secured on one side to the plate <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> by means of bolt <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. The alternator is also slidably secured to bar <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. The alternator is of the known variety&mdash;being a generator with an electromagnet therein. The alternator includes an alternator shaft <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and an alternator tooth pulley <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. The transmission tooth pulley <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and alternator tooth pulley <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> are connected by continuous belt <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. As can be seen from the foregoing, the user provides the energy to operate the alternator <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. The alternator is connected by leads <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> to a load resistor <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> secured to seat sleeve <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The load resistor is capable of absorbing the electrical energy output of the alternator. When the alternator <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> reaches a certain speed, the voltage is transferred to the load resistor. The work of the user is, thus, dissipated in the form of heat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> While not shown, it is envisioned that the chain and gears of drive system assembly <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> and alternator <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> would be covered by a housing for neatness of appearance, acoustic insulation, and safety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Finally, while not shown, it is envisioned that the exercise apparatus would include an electronic control system, which would simultaneously determine the loading of the alternators for both the pedal mechanism <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and stair climber mechanism <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>. A microcomputer would communicate electronically with the alternators through a keyboard and a display panel. The keyboard would be used to manually input a stored exercise program or select a random program. The display panel would provide status of the program and measurements on progress of the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The use of an alternator is a very desirable means of providing workload, both because of its readily and precisely controllable loading, and also because of its usefulness in supplying the circuitry of the system with current. The alternator, in other words, is both a convenient source of electricity and an inductive element having output parameters which are easily monitored and which may be controlled by a single input variable from the microcomputer. </paragraph>
