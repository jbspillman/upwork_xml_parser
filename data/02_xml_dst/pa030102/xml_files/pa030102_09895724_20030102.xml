<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to portable communication devices, and more specifically to a portable communication device with enhanced color transmission and transfusion characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In general, portable communication devices have several common components, such as a transmission and receiving units, which may also be referred to as a transceiver unit, that are controlled by circuitry, an input device coupled to the circuitry, a display unit coupled to the circuitry, and a microphone type receiver unit and a sound generation units working in conjunction with the transceiver unit. For example, known forms of generating sound in a portable communications device include the use of a speaker fixed in position, typically above the display unit, with the microphone unit located at an opposite end from the sound generating unit. Each speaker unit requires a minimum volume of air for proper operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In addition to the common elements that exist in the portable communication devices, there are various other features that users desire. For example, some users prefer to have a mobile device that is aesthetically appealing. One feature that is commonly utilized is a changeable cover. These covers have various designs, logos, or images painted on the surface. One disadvantage to these painted designs is that the paint can become scratched. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, some replaceable covers utilize various colors of plastic. Colored plastic is more durable that paint, but also more limited in the designs that can be created. In addition to colored plastic, transparent or clear plastic can be utilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Another approach to creating an aesthetically appealing design is by introducing hues or color change. The currently known methods incorporated application of paint, graphical ink, and/or mechanically bonding polymer. Either one of these techniques can be used alone or in conjunction with other techniques. The problem and disadvantage to using these techniques is that these techniques are secondary processes that require additional time and money to produce. Furthermore, given that these techniques are applied to the after each cover is produced, they are applications which are costly to apply, reduce the manufacturers ability to recycle due is part to the application of material and solvents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Therefore, what is need is a method and system for producing aesthetically appealing portable communication devices wherein the secondary application are eliminated thereby reducing costs, time delays, and logistical problems while improving recycling features. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A method and system are disclosed for producing aesthetically appealing portable communication that utilize transmittance of hue, hum, or glow thereby eliminating the need for secondary application resulting in increased saving of time and cost as well as the ability to recycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The cover includes a frame and a lens secured to the frame. A first and second surface regions of the lens are proximally located relative to the frame, such that the first surface region is polished to allow light that emerges from the frame to pass through and the second surface region is rough in order to reflect light emerging from the frame. The method of creating a fading color hue in a cover includes the steps of creating a polished region on one surface the lens; creating a reflective region on another surface of the lens to allow for maximum reflection of light; creating a dispersion region on a third surface region of the lens, wherein the third surface is positioned opposite the reflective region; and securing the lens to the frame, such that the polished region and the reflective region are in close proximate to the frame thereby creating a gradually fading hue in the lens.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> cover <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for a portable communication device includes a window or lens <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a frame <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The lens <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is in contact with the frame <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, which will be discussed in detail below. The lens <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is made of transparent resin. However, the lens <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be made of a variety of material that have translucent or transparent characteristics and the teaching set forth herein is not limited thereby. The frame <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> includes openings <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> that define the location of the functions keys of the portable communication device. As discussed below, the frame <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can be made from colored resign or be capable of emitting light of a desired wavelength in the visible spectrum. Although shown in a unique shape and size with a select number of function key openings, the scope and spirit of the teachings set forth and claimed herein is not limited thereby. Any number of openings as well as any shape and size can be created in accordance with the teachings set forth herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the lens <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is shown having a side region <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and a middle region <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The side region <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> overlaps a lip portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the frame <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The frame <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> also includes a side support portion <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Although discussed with respect to only one side of the frame <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the teachings set forth herein apply to the entire region of the frame <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> surrounding the lens <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The lens <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is secured in position in the frame <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> between the side support portion <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the lip portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The side region <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the lens <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, when in the secured position, is proximally located near the lip portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the side support portion <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, such that light can travel from the frame <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to the lens <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> through the side region <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, in one embodiment, the side region <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> includes an upper surface <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, a side surface <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, and a lower surface <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. The upper surface <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is prepared to have a fog-like texture. The term &ldquo;fog-like&rdquo; is used and an uneven surface is shown, the intent is to create a surface such that when the light emerges from the side region <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> through the upper surface <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, then the light is dispersed. The side surface <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is polished to allow the majority of the light to pass through with minimal alteration. The side surface <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is shown for illustration purposes, but can be matingly and proximally located near the side support region <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Regardless of where the side surface <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the lens <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is located relative to the side support region <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the frame <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the light traveling through the frame <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> must emerge from the frame <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and enter the lens <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The lower surface <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is uneven or &ldquo;rough&rdquo; in order to disperse and reflect light away from the lens <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Although the term rough is used and a jagged shape is shown, the actual texture is relatively smooth to the touch, but rough at the microscopic level relative to the wavelength of the light being reflected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The frame <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can include a light-emitting source that produces or emits visible light waves <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in the direction of the lens <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The light waves <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can be of a variety of wavelength and, hence, a variety of colors and the scope of the teaching set forth herein is not limited thereby. The light waves <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> travel through the side support region <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the lip portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and emerge form the frame <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the frame can be made of a desired color and the color of the frame <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is emitted into the lens <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Regardless of whether a light source is used or the color of the frame <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is utilized, the result will be light waves, of a specific wavelength, emerge from the frame <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> through the <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The light waves that come in contact with the rough portion of the lower surface <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> are reflected and generally do not enter the lens <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The light waves <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> emerge from the frame <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> through the side support portion <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> enter the lens <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> through the side surface <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The light waves that enter the lens <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> through the side surface <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> emerge from the upper surface <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and are dispersed by the fog-like texture of the upper surface <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Thus, the lens <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> appears to have a hue or color change that gradually fades in the direction away from the side surface <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In addition to the textures on the surface of the side region <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the surface of the middle region in close proximity to the side region <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be altered to further alter the characteristics of the light waves emerging from the lens <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. For example, the area at the boundary of the side region <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the middle region <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, which is in the middle region <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> area, can be masked to prevent any light from emerging therefrom. Alternatively, the surface of the same area can be altered to further alter the characteristics of the light while allowing some of the light to pass through. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, in another embodiment, the both the <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and the surface of the <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can be roughed to enhance the reflection characteristics of the joint between the <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and the <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, in yet another embodiment, the <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is made smoother than the <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, such that the <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is almost fog-like similar to the <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, so that the light that emerges from the <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> that is not reflected will be dispersed as it enters the lens <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> through the <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Although described in the context of particular embodiments, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that a number of modifications to these teachings may occur. For example, a variety of surface texture and composition are contemplated in a variety of surface-to-surface combinations. Furthermore, a variety of materials can be use to create the lens <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that will effect the light waves in a different manner. Thus, while various embodiments have been particularly shown and described, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that certain modifications or changes, in form and shape, may be made therein without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention as set forth above and claimed hereafter. </paragraph>
