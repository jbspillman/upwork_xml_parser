<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to devices and methods for implementing electrical or ground connections with the metallic conduits employed for fiber-optic communication. More particularly, this invention relates to bonding devices and methods for metal tubing which is relatively small in diameter and accommodates only a few fiber optical strands. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> As the use and popularity of fiber-optic cables in communication systems have become widespread, the communication networks that employ fiber-optic lines have involved cables of relatively large diameter. These cables accommodate numerous optic-fibers and are typically surrounded by a steel shield or pipe which has an outer cover manufactured of non-conductive materials such as plastic. As more and more communication networks have been installed, it has become clear that there may be, at least in the short term, an over-capacity of fiber-optic capacity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> For numerous communication applications, it is clearly not required that large numbers of fiber-optics be installed. Accordingly, there has recently been a trend to fiber-optics communication networks which employ a few fiber-optic strands installed in a stainless steel or metal tube of a relatively small diameter as compared to the majority of fiber-optics cable installations. For such installations, continuous coils of stainless steel tubing are typically employed. It is, of course, necessary to provide an electrical bond between sections of the stainless tubing and also to provide adequate ground connection. Such electrical bonding and ground connections have been employed to date by devices adapted from other ground and bond applications and are not fully adapted for the new low capacity installation involving the use of stainless steel tubing, which may typically contain from 2-60 fibers and have an inside diameter 1.5 millimeters to 3.6 mm and an outside diameter 1.7 to 3.9 mm. It is for this latter type of application termed &ldquo;mini fiber-optic conduit&rdquo; that the invention has particular applicability. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Briefly stated, the invention in a preferred form is a bond clamp assembly which provides a bond or ground connection for a mini fiber-optic metal conduit for one or more optic fibers. The clamp assembly comprises a base defining a first jaw with a first contour which is generally symmetrical along a transverse axis. A threaded stud projects orthogonally from the base. A cap defines a second jaw and has a second contour comprising a concave surface. The concave surface is disposed along a second transverse receiving axis with the second contour having a different configuration on the first contour and being generally alignable therewith. The cap also has an aperture for receiving the stud. A conductor is connected to the cap and extends generally laterally therefrom. A retainer such as a nut is threably engageable with the stud to clamp the jaws against a mini fiber-optic conduit received between the jaws and which extends generally transversely thereto so that the conduit is clamped in a stable clamped relationship. The cap may have a generally J-shaped profile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the invention, the bond clamp assembly employs a first clamp member which defines a jaw having a contour along a first transversely extending receiving axis. An integral generally cylindrical tongue defines an interior thread and projects orthogonally relative to the receiving axis. A second clamp member has a jaw with a second contour different from the first contour and generally alignable therewith. The second clamp member has a generally cylindrical groove complementary with the cylindrical tongue and slidably engageable therealong. A connector connects a wire conductor and defines an aperture. A fastener, such as a screw, threadably engages with the threaded surface and has a shoulder which engages the connector to clamp the jaws against a mini fiber-optic conduit receivable therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The first clamp member may define a clamping receptacle defined by a pair of parallel side walls and a central concave surface disposed between a pair of convex surfaces which intersect the side wall. The second clamp jaw has a clamp receptacle defined by a pair of laterally spaced, generally parallel, transversely extending planar clamp strips and a central parallel clamp strip deposed between the pair of intersecting diagonal clamp surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> An object of the invention is to provide a new and improved bond system for fiber-optic conduits having a small diameter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Another object of the invention is to provide a new and improved bond system for connecting and grounding fiber-optic tubing for which a single device can effectively accommodate a range of differently dimensioned metal tubes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A further object of the invention is to provide a new and improved bond device which provides an electrical bond of high integrity and reliability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A further object of the invention is to provide a new and improved bond device which may be installed in an efficient manner and has an efficient low cost construction. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> With reference to the drawings wherein like numerals represent like parts throughout the several figures, an electrical bond clamp assembly in accordance with the present invention is generally designated by the numeral <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The bond clamp assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is especially adapted for installation to the metallic shield or mini fiber-optic conduit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Such a mini fiber-optic conduit may, for example, house as few as two optic fibers <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> within a stainless steel tubing having an inside diameter of 1.5 mm and an outside diameter of 1.7 mm and as many as sixty optical fibers within a stainless steel tubing having an inside diameter of 3.6 mm and an outside diameter of 3.9 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Even within the mini fiber-optic tube environment there can typically be some variation in tube diameter. Because of the relatively small tube diameter in relation to conventional fiber-optics cables, it is highly desirable to provide a bond clamp assembly which provides a highly effective electrical bond connection for a wide variety of tube sizes, but is configured so it can be easily installed and does not crush the small fiber-optic conduit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, a given electrical bond clamp assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be effectively installed on fiber-optic cables which employ mini fiber-optic conduits <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> wherein each has a different diameter. The fiber-optic clamp assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a base <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which defines a longitudinal receiving jaw <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> having a specific contour <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The contour <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> extends generally uniformly along a transverse axis. A threaded stud <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> projects orthogonally from the base. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> A retainer plate or cap <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> defines a clamp jaw <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and has an integral crimp structure which connects with a flexible wire <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. A ring terminal <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> may be mounted at the free end of the wire <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The retainer plate or cap <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> has a generally J-shaped profile illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The retainer plate <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> includes an aperture <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> which receives the stud <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The clamp jaw <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the retainer plate has a convex bent form at the underside, as best illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, which shows the relationship between the jaw contour <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the base and the jaw contour <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the retainer plate. The jaws <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> form a transverse cradle for the mini filter-optic conduit. The radius of curvatures in the contours <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are selected so that the jaws can receive and clamp against a wide variety of conduit diameters in the range of, for example 1.7 to 3.9 mm, while providing a firm and reliable electrical connection of high mechanical and conductive integrity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> A nut <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and a lockwasher <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> secure the retainer plate <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to the stud <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and, upon tightening, clamp the plate against the mini fiber-optic conduit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> which is disposed between the jaws <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the retainer plate <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the base <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The clamp assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is formed of tinplated copper to provide a complementary conductive connection with the stainless steel shield. The bond clamp fits all sizes within the mini fiber-optic conduit range and incorporates a ring terminal in the upper jaw in a highly efficient manner. The connector also provides a relatively large footprint around the received conduit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> so that upon clamping the nut <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, a compressive force is distributed over a relatively great clamp interface area via contours <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, so that the received conduit will not be compressed while being retained in a stable clamped relationship. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 through 10</cross-reference>, a second embodiment of an electrical bond clamp bond assembly is generally designated by the numeral <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Bond clamp assembly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> comprises a pair of cooperative clamp members <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> which cooperate to receive and clamp the received fiber-optic cable <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>. A given bond clamp assembly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be employed for both smaller and larger diameter mini fiber-optic conduits <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> With additional reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the base clamp member <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> includes a jaw like portion <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and a cylindrical, integrally connected, orthogonally projecting connector <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The interior of the connector <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> has a threaded bore <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. The upper clamp member <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> includes a jaw like extension <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and a cylindrical yoke <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. The yoke <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> has an interior cylindrical surface which is complementary with the exterior surface of connector <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> to allow for a sliding reception therewith. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> A threaded fastener <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is inserted through the aperture <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> of a ring connector <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, which attaches to a flexible wire <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. The ring connector <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is forced against the planar annular top <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> of the clamp member <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. The fastener shoulder <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> engages the ring connector <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and threads with the connector bore <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> to secure the clamp assembly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in a clamped configuration against a received fiber-optic conduit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The clamp assembly also provides an efficient electrical bond. It will be appreciated that the connector <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and yoke <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> slideably engage in a tongue and groove-type connection. The connector <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and yoke <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> provide an engagement which is stable about the orthogonal axis. A second ring terminal <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> may be fixed to the free end of wire <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the respective jaws <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> of the clamp members each have a well defined specific geometric contour <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> which cooperates to clamp a received fiber-optic conduit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in a stable clamp position to provide an electrical and mechanical connection of high integrity without crushing the conduit. The jaw contours <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> extend transversely, generally uniformly to define the receiving cavity for the fiber-optic conduit. Jaw contour <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> is defined by a pair opposite parallel walls <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> and a quasi U-shaped lower wall comprised of a concave central portion <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> and opposed slightly convex surfaces <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight>. The opposing jaw contour <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> includes a wall <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, which generally aligns with wall <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and an integral upper portion including upper coplanar walls <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> and a recessed upper clamp surface <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> which connects with pair of diagonal surfaces <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight>. It should be appreciated that the specific jaw configuration provides both a stable cradle for the received conduit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and a large compressive area so that the compressive force may be distributed over a relatively large area without compressing the conduit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The clamp assembly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may thus be employed for a wide range of mini fiber-optic conduits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The clamp members <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> for one embodiment of the clamp assembly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are manufactured from bronze. Alternately, the members <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> could also be zinc cast members with a tin plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> While preferred embodiments of the foregoing bond clamp assemblies have been set forth for purposes of description, the foregoing description should not be deemed a limitation in the invention herein. Accordingly, various modification, adaptation, and alternatives may occur to one skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
