<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to the field of semiconductor integrated circuit manufacturing, and more specifically, to a method of creating a pattern on an EUV mask blank without particles and an EUV mask blank made with such a method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Discussion of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> During the fabrication of integrated circuits (IC), each semiconductor wafer is subdivided into small identical fields that are adjacent to each other. Each field includes one or more IC chips. A radiation-sensitive material, such as photoresist, is coated onto the wafer. Then a scanner with a reduction projection system is used to scan radiation across a mask and onto one field at a time to expose portions of the photoresist. The mask determines the pattern to be transferred to the wafer through the process of exposing, developing, and etching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography uses a transmissive mask at 248 nanometers (nm), 193 nm, or 157 nm to print features with a critical dimension (CD) of 100-180 nm. Next generation lithography (NGL), such as extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, can print features with smaller CD. For example, an EUV scanner may use 4 imaging mirrors and a Numerical Aperture (NA) of 0.10 to achieve a CD of 50-70 nm with a depth of focus (DOF) of about 1.00 micrometer (um). Alternatively, an EUV scanner may use 6 imaging mirrors and a NA of 0.25 to print a CD of 20-30 nm although the DOF will be reduced to about 0.17 um. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> EUV lithography uses a reflective mask for exposure since nearly all condensed materials are highly absorbing in the EUV wavelength range of 11-15 nm. An EUV mask may be fabricated from an EUV mask blank after the EUV mask blank has been inspected for defects and repaired. In order to identify the location of the defects, a pattern, such as a fiducial mark, is etched into the reflective surface of an EUV mask blank. However, etching produces particles that may contaminate tools and degrade process yield. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Thus, what is needed is a method of creating a pattern on an EUV mask blank without generating particles and an EUV mask blank made with such a method. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In the following description, numerous details, such as specific materials, dimensions, and processes, are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, one skilled in the art will realize that the invention may be practiced without these particular details. In other instances, well-known semiconductor equipment and processes have not been described in particular detail so as to avoid obscuring the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A mask is used in lithography to define a desired pattern in photoresist on a wafer. Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography uses a reflective mask for exposure since nearly all condensed materials are highly absorbing in the EUV wavelength range of 11-15 nm. An EUV mask is fabricated from an EUV mask blank after the EUV mask blank is inspected for defects. Fiducial marks are needed on the EUV mask blank to serve as a reference for identifying the location of the defects. The present invention includes a method of creating a pattern, such as a fiducial mark, on an EUV mask blank without generating particles and an EUV mask blank made with such a method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows an embodiment of an EUV mask blank <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> according to the present invention. The EUV mask blank <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> has a first region <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight> and a second region <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight>. The first region <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight> is a multilayer mirror <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> disposed over a substrate <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>. The multilayer mirror <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> has 20-80 pairs of alternating layers of a high index of refraction material <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight>, such as Molybdenum, and a low index of refraction material <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight>, such as Silicon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The second region <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight> is a compound, such as Molybdenum Silicide, of the high index of refraction material <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight> and the low index of refraction material <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> that is disposed over a substrate <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>. The upper surface of the second region <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight> is lower than the upper surface of the first region <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight>. The difference in step height between the first region <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight> and the second region <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight> defines a feature <highlight><bold>1250</bold></highlight> in a pattern, such as a fiducial mark. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Various embodiments of a method of creating a pattern, such as a fiducial mark, on an EUV mask blank <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> according to the present invention will be described next. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> First, a substrate <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> having a low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), a smooth surface, and a low defect level is used as the starting material for an EUV mask of the present invention. An embodiment is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). The substrate <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> may be formed out of a glass-ceramic material with the desired properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Second, a multilayer (ML) mirror <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> is formed over the substrate <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> since an EUV mask operates on the principle of a distributed Bragg reflector. An embodiment is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). The ML mirror <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> includes about 20-80 pairs of alternating layers of a high index of refraction material <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight> and a low index of refraction material <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight>. The thickness uniformity should be better than 0.8% across the substrate <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the ML mirror <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> includes <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> pairs of alternating layers of a high index of refraction material <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight> and a low index of refraction material <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight>. The high index of refraction material <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight> may be formed from about 2.8 nm thick Molybdenum while the low index of refraction material <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> may be formed from about 4.1 nm thick Silicon. As needed, a capping layer (not shown), such as about 11.0 nm thick Silicon, may be formed over the ML mirror <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> to prevent oxidation of Molybdenum at the upper surface of the ML mirror <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> in an EUV mask. The ML mirror <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> can achieve a peak reflectivity of about 60-75% at the EUV central illumination wavelength of about 13.4 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Ion beam deposition (IBD) or direct current (DC) magnetron sputtering may be used to form the ML mirror <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> over the substrate <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>. IBD results in less perturbation and fewer defects in the upper surface of the ML mirror <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> because the deposition conditions may be optimized to smooth over a defect on the substrate <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>. DC magnetron sputtering is more conformal, thus producing better thickness uniformity, but any defect on the substrate <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> will tend to propagate up through the alternating layers to the upper surface of the ML mirror <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Third, a beam <highlight><bold>1230</bold></highlight> is used to locally heat a desired region of the ML mirror <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight>. An embodiment is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>). The heating time may be as short as a few seconds. Heating the desired region of the ML mirror <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> to a temperature of 300-800 degrees C. will result in interdiffusion of the thin alternating layers of high index of refraction material <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight>, such as Molybdenum, and low index of refraction material <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight>, such as Silicon. The interdiffusion will form a different material, such as a compound of Molybdenum Silicide, that occupies a smaller volume than the original ML mirror <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The contraction, or reduction in volume, will create a difference in step height between the heated region and the surrounding unheated regions of the ML mirror <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight>. The difference in step height defines a feature <highlight><bold>1250</bold></highlight> in a pattern, such as a fiducial mark. If desired the beam <highlight><bold>1230</bold></highlight> may be tilted or rotated to create different slopes or angles in the sidewalls of the feature <highlight><bold>1250</bold></highlight> in a pattern. The beam <highlight><bold>1230</bold></highlight> may be collimated or focused to help obtain the desired profile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The heating process may be adjusted to vary the extent and rate of contraction to avoid any undesirable deformation or other damage that may be induced by thermal or mechanical stress. Unlike in an etching process, a heating process does not remove any material so no particle is formed. Any particle is undesirable since it may contaminate a tool or degrade yield. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the beam <highlight><bold>1230</bold></highlight> is an electron beam. The range of the secondary electrons and the scattered electrons may be optimized by adjusting the acceleration voltage. In another embodiment, the beam <highlight><bold>1230</bold></highlight> is an ion beam. Sputtering, ion implantation, and knock-on should be avoided. In still another embodiment, the beam <highlight><bold>1230</bold></highlight> is an optical beam, such as a laser beam that has a continuous wave or is pulsed. The transmission and reflectivity characteristics of the ML mirror <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> should be considered in selecting the appropriate wavelength and bandwidth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The beam <highlight><bold>1230</bold></highlight> may be scanned through a field aperture to define a feature <highlight><bold>1250</bold></highlight> in a pattern that differs in size from the beam <highlight><bold>1230</bold></highlight>. Scanning may also be used to create a feature <highlight><bold>1250</bold></highlight> in a pattern that differs in shape from the beam <highlight><bold>1230</bold></highlight>. Scanning may be helpful in improving the uniformity of the heating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Many embodiments and numerous details have been set forth above in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. One skilled in the art will appreciate that many of the features in one embodiment are equally applicable to other embodiments. One skilled in the art will also appreciate the ability to make various equivalent substitutions for those specific materials, processes, dimensions, concentrations, etc. described herein. It is to be understood that the detailed description of the present invention should be taken as illustrative and not limiting, wherein the scope of the present invention should be determined by the claims that follow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Thus, we have described a method of creating a pattern on an EUV mask blank without generating particles and an EUV mask blank made with such a method. </paragraph>
