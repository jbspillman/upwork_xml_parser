<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to tailoring a broadcast schedule for transmission of multimedia content over a communication channel, and more particularly to selecting the broadcast schedule based on storage area and consumer information </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Different methods of supplying television content to a consumer have been employed by cable television (CATV) companies and satellite television (SATV) providers, using the ultrahigh frequency (UHF) and very high frequency (VHF) communication bands. These methods suffer from bandwidth limitations and an inability to tailor the content of a broadcast to the individual taste of the consumer. Programming content is predetermined by the CATV provider and broadcasted to the consumers that subscribe to the service. Multiple levels of service are usually available, where more channels of programming are available for an increasing financial charge to the consumer. The consumer can change the level of service subscribed. However, the content of the level of service is usually the same at a given time of day. Thus, the consumer cannot change the content of the level of service and must accept what is broadcasted at a particular time. A fixed number of channels are available, based on a bandwidth of a system employed, which then sets the breadth of the content that will be available to all the subscribers of the service. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A variation on CATV service that introduced a measure of consumer choice is Pay per View&trade;, which allows a subscriber to pay for a view of a movie or a particular event broadcast at a particular time, such as a sporting event. The subscriber could choose to pay for and watch a particular movie at the time the movie was broadcast. In this manner, subscribers may choose from a given number of movies allocated to the Pay per View&trade; channels on the CATV or SATV system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> CATV providers have also introduced a server into a head-end of the CATV system as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> Is a representation of a CATC system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> that provides simultaneous viewing of movies by consumers indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, as individual homes. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the CATV head-end <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may contain three or four hundred movies indicated by movies <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. A cable network <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is connected to a plurality of homes indicated as home <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> through home <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. In such a system bandwidth is allocated for simultaneous viewing of movies selected by each home. For example, a home <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> has selected a movie <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> to view. The CATV system allocates bandwidth to allow the home <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> to watch the movie <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. At the same time, the home <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> may have selected a movie <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> to view. The CATV system allocates bandwidth to allow the home <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> to view the movie <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> concurrently with the home <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> viewing the movie <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. Bandwidth allocated in this way by the CATV system is not available for the other uses until the home is finished viewing the selected movie. The simultaneous allocation of bandwidth to accommodate the individual homes viewing the different movies presents limitations on the system design. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The bandwidth in the CATV system is finite and the system will only be able to service a finite number of requests for different movies in the example given above. Another example of a limitation, in this kind of system, is that the system has to be designed to accommodate the peak usage. Peak usage might occur at 9 PM Saturday night. Usage is not constant and varies with time of day and the day of the week. Therefore, bandwidth is often underutilized during periods of light use. Periods of light use may occur at 3 AM on a weekday when most people are sleeping instead of viewing movies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> These prior art systems require the consumer to watch the programming in real time, as the broadcast is occurring. Consumers can eliminate the real time requirement by using a video tape recorder to tape a program while it was being received. The videotape of the program could then be played at a later time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Following videotape recorders came hard drive storage-based receiver devices, which allowed the consumer to store the digital television broadcast on the hard disk as data. These devices are manufactured and sold under the trade names TIVO&trade; and UltimateTV&trade;. Hard drive storage-based receiver devices such as these provide similar functionality as that of their predecessors, videotape recorders. The hard drive storage devices attached to the previously described CATV systems suffer from the same restrictions in consumer choice of content since all of these prior art systems are designed to receive streaming video from the real time broadcast. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Both the videotape recorder and the hard drive storage provided by TIVO&trade; and UltimateTV&trade; need to be managed by the consumer since the storage capacities are finite. Management by the consumer consists of deciding what to save and what to erase from storage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> What is needed therefore, is a system that allows the consumer to select multimedia-content in such a manner that does not tax the bandwidth of the delivery system. What is also needed is a method of providing transparent management of the storage device associated with the television receiver so that the consumer is decoupled from the task of management. What is also needed is a method that leads to scheduling delivery of multimedia content in an optimal way and consistent way over time. Additionally, there is a need for a method of selecting multimedia-content for the consumer so that the multimedia-content available to the consumer is more closely in line with the consumer&apos;s interests. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">System Level Overview </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a schematic representation of the invention, depicting a selection system for multimedia-content <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, as applied to a general number n, of digital television (DTV) receivers. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> DTV receiver <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> has a storage area <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. There may be a general number of DTV receivers n, as previously mentioned, where a DTV receiver <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> represents the n<highlight><superscript>th </superscript></highlight>such DTV receiver having a storage area <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The DTV receivers receive a broadcast signal <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, which contains multimedia-content. Broadcast signal <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> may be provided to the DTV receivers by any of the methods that are will known in the art. In one embodiment, broadcast signal <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> can propagate in a coaxial cable or an optical fiber transmission line to the DTV receiver. In another embodiment, broadcast signal <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> can be broadcast from a satellite and be received by a satellite dish receiver configured for use with multimedia equipment. The broadcast signal <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, or a portion of the broadcast signal, may be stored on the storage area <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. A consumer may view the multimedia-content stored on the storage area <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>after the broadcast signal has been received and stored on the storage area <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Information pertaining to the multimedia-content, stored on the storage area, is communicated along return communication path <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and is received at an information collection system <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, a scheduler <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> accepts the information from the information collection system <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and selects multimedia-content that will be broadcast to the consumers from a pool of available multimedia content. The information collected from the consumers may include data on the state of the multimedia-content residing on the storage area. The selection of multimedia-content may be made in the light of the information collected from the consumer. A multimedia-content database/server configures the selected multimedia-content for transmission and may communicate with the information collection system <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> as required through a connector <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. Minimally, the connection <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> is used to communicate the list of available multimedia content to the information collection system <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> such that analysis of the information and data received from <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is applied to the current list of available multimedia content. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The selected multimedia-content is configured for transmission by a data encapsulation and packetization process and equipment at <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. Other programming content and system information at <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is multiplexed with the selected multimedia-content at <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> resulting in broadcast signal <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The invention provides an infrastructure for scheduling delivery of multimedia content such that the consumer(s) has the ability to access multimedia-content immediately, without having to wait for the particular time the multimedia-content is scheduled to be broadcast. The cycle just described may repeat at a periodic rate, delivering selected multimedia-content to the consumer(s). The periodic rate is flexible and may be chosen as desired. The previous description may be applied to any number of consumers. Thus, the application may be to a single consumer or a plurality of consumers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Corresponding to the schematic representation shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> embodies four broad processes that may be combined to select and adjust the multimedia-content of the consumer&apos;s storage area. Each of these broad processes will subsequently be described in more detail. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, information is gathered from the consumer at block <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. The information may come from a variety of sources. The information would be part of the information that would be used by the scheduler <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) to select and schedule the multimedia-content to be broadcast to the consumer(s) at block <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. At block <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> the selected and scheduled multimedia-content is broadcast to the consumer(s). In block <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> the content of the consumer&apos;s storage area <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>(<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) is managed as the multimedia-content is transferred to the storage area from the received broadcast signal. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Consumer Information </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Information gathered from the consumer may come from a variety of sources. For example, the information may be in the form of a report of the consumer&apos;s viewing history over a time interval obtained from reading the directory of the storage area <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>(<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). In another embodiment, as a step in configuring the storage area, the consumer may enter information which becomes the consumer&apos;s profile. The consumer&apos;s profile may be updated as the consumer&apos;s preferences change over time. Thus, the selection of multimedia-concern, content, made by the selector/scheduler <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) is able to dynamically alter its selections based on the changing preferences of the consumer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Information is gathered by return communication path <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) and is supplied to the information collection system <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. Information may be gathered in any one of the many ways that are well known in the art. One way to gather the information is by using a dial up modem to establish a connection with the information collection system <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and then transfer the information over any suitable network such as the Internet, for example. Alternatively, the information could be sent within the portion of the bandwidth assigned for up-link communications from the DTV receiver to the cable television (CATV) provider. The same method of communication may be used with satellite television (SATV) systems that employ an active link from the DTV receiver that allows two-way communication with the SATV provider. Other forms of information gathering may be employed such as a telephone call between the consumer and the CATV or SATV provider as well as communication of consumer information through the mail. The invention is not limited by the means employed to transfer the information to the information collection system. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Selecting/Scheduling </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the process of selecting new multimedia-content to be broadcast may include, as input, a list of current movies that have been introduced in the last week. The list could then be filtered by selection criteria, such as that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, resulting in the selection of the multimedia-content that will be broadcast next to the consumers. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, whether the current multimedia-content has been consumed is listed at block <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. Current multimedia-content in this usage refers to the presently existing multimedia-content on the consumer&apos;s storage area. Additional selection criteria may include: how many times the current multimedia-content has been consumed (block <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>); has the current multimedia-content been marked for deletion (block <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>); is the current multimedia-content still in the storage area (block <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>); is the current multimedia-content intended to be saved/archived (block <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>); and is the storage are a categorized (block <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As previously described, the multimedia-content may cover a variety of subject matter. In one embodiment, the multimedia-content refers to movies. Selecting movies may include consideration of the consumer&apos;s viewing history containing information on how many times a particular movie was viewed. Other movies that were not viewed could be identified. Movies that were marked to be archived would be noted. Other information could be factored in, such as consumer preferences. With respect to movies, the consumer may be asked to enter data on his or her viewing preferences (from the consumer profile), such as ranking in order of interest; westerns, action, drama, comedy, etc. Other information might include the consumer&apos;s interest in &ldquo;old&rdquo; movies verses &ldquo;new&rdquo; movies. Information on the time the consumer viewed a particular movie could also be gathered. For example, the scheduler may decide, based on consumer information collected over time, that western movies are most likely to be viewed between 9 PM and 11 PM rather than 2 PM to 4 PM. Depending on how often the multimedia-content was updated, the scheduler could use this information to ensure that new western movies were available to the consumer between 9 PM and 11 PM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Information collected from the consumer(s) may be used to compile a histogram <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The histogram <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> displays information on the categorized multimedia-content of the consumer&apos;s storage area or the aggregate storage area of a plurality of consumers, as a function of time. It is apparent to those of skill in the art that the invention may be implemented at a variety of levels as was previously explained. Therefore, the histogram in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> may represent information from a single consumer or a plurality of consumers. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, information from the multimedia-content is depicted at <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> divided into several categories. A category <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>, a category <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, a category <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight>, a category <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> and a category <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> make up the multimedia-content of the storage area. The multimedia-content may change as a function of time. The axis indicating time is depicted by time <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>. Each category has a magnitude at a particular time as indicated with user data frequency <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>. User data frequency <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> may represent a number of items within a category of multimedia stored on the storage area or it may represent any other aspect of consumer information such as the number of times a particular multimedia-content has been consumed. With application to movies, category <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> could represent western movies and a quantity <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>T could represent the number of western movies residing on the storage area at a particular time <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight>. The scheduler could use the information contained in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> to decide to make western movies a greater percentage of the multimedia-content transmitted in the next broadcast, because of a declining number of western movies residing on the storage area and the need to update and refresh this category with new western movies. In a similar way the user data frequency <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> could represent the number of times western movies were watched over a particular time interval <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight> and the scheduler could interpret the declining trend shown by the category <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> to arrive at the same decision concerning western movies. The category <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> and the category <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight>, like the category <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>,have declining trends and the same decision could be made, e.g. (increase the percentage of those categories in the next broadcast of multimedia-content). Conversely, the category <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> shows an increasing trend with respect to user data frequency <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>, therefore the scheduler could decrease the percentage of this category in the next broadcast of multimedia-content to prevent the popular multimedia content from being replaced by new content. The category <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> has remained at a constant level over the time interval shown; therefore the scheduler could keep the percentage of the category <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> unchanged in the next broadcast. This method of selecting is just one of the many ways the scheduler <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) could select multimedia-content intended for the next broadcast, the invention is not limited by the way in which multimedia-content is selected or scheduled. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Broadcasting Multimedia-content </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The invention decouples a consumer&apos;s decision and action to consume multimedia-content from the need to allocate bandwidth for transmission of the broadcast in real time. This decoupling is achieved as previously described. When the consumer views multimedia-content on his television for example, the multimedia-content has already been broadcast, received, and transferred to the storage area before the multimedia-content is viewed by the consumers. The selection of multimedia-content occurs in an intelligent way within the invention, based on the gathered consumer information. An advantage of selecting the multimedia-content in this manner is that efficient use of the bandwidth, available for the broadcast signal <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>), is made by limiting the transmission of the multimedia-content to content that the consumers are likely to be interested in. Efficiency as used in this context refers to multimedia-content actually consumed, divided by the total multimedia-content actually broadcast. Thus, if the entire broadcast of multimedia-content was actually consumed, the efficiency would be one hundred percent, and if none of the multimedia-content broadcast were consumed, the efficiency would be zero percent. By using consumer information as previously described, a multimedia-content provider is able to tailor their service and not waste bandwidth, or the consumer&apos;s time, by broadcasting content that is not of interest to the consumer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Broadcast signal <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) may carry the selected multimedia-content according to a variety of methods. In one embodiment, the multimedia-content may be sent on a substantially dedicated channel using a constant data rate. System architecture that sets aside one or more separate channels for the multimedia-content will result in a rapid transfer of the multimedia-content to the storage area <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>ba </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the multimedia-content may be multiplexed onto existing channels and sent at a variable data rate using a technique known in the art as opportunistic insertion of data (OID). With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, OID is graphically shown as applied to a television broadcast <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>. A horizontal axis is labeled time <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> and is meant to convey the distribution of data in the television broadcast as a function of time. A data rate <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> shows the instantaneous transfer rate of data at a given time. A conventional DTV programming <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> is shown as the solid region and the multimedia-content according to the invention is shown as a multimedia-content delivery <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight>. Two individual points in time are marked as a time T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> and a time T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight>. At the time T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>, a <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>data rate represents the data rate required to transmit the conventional DTV programming <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight>. A <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>data rate represents the data rate available for the transmission of the multimedia-content delivery <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight>. At the time T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight>, a lower data rate <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is available for the multimedia-content delivery <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> because of the greater data rate required by the conventional DTV programming <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> represented by a data rate <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Transmission of the multimedia-content delivery <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> proceeds as described according to a variable data rate using OID. By necessity, variable data rate transmission requires more time to transmit the multimedia-content delivery <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> than would be required by constant data rate transmission using substantially dedicated channels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The multimedia-content, indicated as the multimedia-content delivery <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> may be configured according to any of the standards used in the art. One such standard is the Moving Pictures Experts Group (MPEG) standard for video data. Therefore the multimedia-content delivery <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> can be a simultaneous transmission of the plurality of multimedia-content files selected to make up the multimedia-content delivery <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, multimedia-content may be configured in a serial or sequential format. For example, a plurality of movies may be transmitted one after the other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Efficient use of the available bandwidth is achieved with the methods described above for transmission of the multimedia-content. The methods are flexible and can be adjusted by the multimedia-content provider to achieve a low or high data rate as desired. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Managing the Multimedia-content on the Storage Area </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Many methods of managing the multimedia-content on the storage area are possible. In one embodiment, multimedia-content management may be based on a set of predetermined rules that have been selected by the consumer. At the most basic level, an embodiment with only one rule could allow the new multimedia-content to be added to the old multimedia-content until the storage area was full, at which time the new multimedia-content could overwrite the oldest of the stored multimedia-content. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> As previously described, the storage area may be categorized. The categories may be allocated by the consumer according to criteria such as fifty percent of the storage area is set aside for movies, twenty five percent is set aside for history subject matter, and fifteen percent is set aside for science subject matter, five percent is set aside for audio, and five percent is set aside for data, etc. or the entire storage area may be set aside for one subject. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows a storage area for multimedia-content that has been categorized <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the categories correspond to the five categories previously described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the categories <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>. The storage area could be the one shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> as the storage area <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The storage area <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may be located in a variety of places; it need not be located proximate to DTV receiver <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. For example, storage area <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>a could be a virtual storage area accessed across a network residing in a location far away from DTV receiver <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> or close to DTV receiver <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. Storage area <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>a is shown located as it is in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> merely for convenience. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> One management example using a simple two rule set applied to the multimedia-content of a categorized storage area could be as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> 1) keep only three items in a category at any one time; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> 2) do not erase items that have been tagged for archiving. Many methods of managing multimedia-content are anticipated. The simple two rule set described above could be implemented as shown within the flow diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The following description is applicable to a computer-operated system for managing the multimedia-content on the consumer&apos;s storage area. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, multimedia-content is input to the storage area at <highlight><bold>850</bold></highlight>. If the consumer has chosen to allow the multimedia-content provider to manage the content on his storage area a control would be set to direct flow out of an auto-manage block <highlight><bold>852</bold></highlight> to a block <highlight><bold>858</bold></highlight>. If the consumer had chosen to manage the storage area himself control would be directed to a block <highlight><bold>854</bold></highlight> resulting in the transfer of the multimedia-content to the storage area at a block <highlight><bold>880</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Returning to the case where the consumer has chosen to allow the storage area to be managed automatically, tags on the contents of the multimedia-content already on the storage area (old multimedia-content) are checked at a block <highlight><bold>860</bold></highlight> to see if any of the items are tagged for archiving. If none of the old multimedia-content is tagged for archiving, control flows to a block <highlight><bold>862</bold></highlight> and the new multimedia-content is transferred to the storage area in which case the old multimedia-content may be deleted at a block <highlight><bold>880</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Returning to the case where old multimedia-content has been tagged for archiving at block <highlight><bold>866</bold></highlight> a possible delete of old multimedia-content may be required or indicated at a block <highlight><bold>868</bold></highlight>. The number of items in a category is checked at a block <highlight><bold>870</bold></highlight>. If there are less than three items in the category, control is transferred to a block <highlight><bold>876</bold></highlight>. The new multimedia-content is accepted at a block <highlight><bold>878</bold></highlight> and the new multimedia-content is transferred to the storage area at a block <highlight><bold>880</bold></highlight>. If there are three items already existing in the category and one is tagged for archiving the older of the two items is overwritten by the new multimedia-content. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Possibly all three entries in the category are tagged for archiving, in this case control is transferred to a block <highlight><bold>872</bold></highlight> and none of the new multimedia-content in the category is accepted as shown at a block <highlight><bold>874</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> It is anticipated that management of the multimedia-content storage area may proceed under many policies. The examples described above are a small example of the policies that may be employed by those of skill in the art within the scope of the invention. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Customized Content For the Consumer </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> As was previously described, the concepts embodied in this invention may be employed at a high level to a plurality of consumers or the invention may be employed on an individual consumer basis. As an example, a DTV multimedia-content service provider may be supplying individualized multimedia-content that has been tailored to each consumer. There are many ways of configuring the multimedia-content for transmission. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> displays two ways of configuring a transmission of the multimedia-content that enables the multimedia-content to be customized for each consumer individually. In one embodiment, the configuration can be done such that the multimedia content is scrambled and a scrambling method or a scrambling key that is linked to the receiver identification is used to unscramble the multimedia-content intended for the particular receiver. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, broadcast signal <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> may be configured with movies as the multimedia-content that are formatted consecutively in time as shown in <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>(a serial format) or the broadcast signal <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> may be formatted such that the movies are formatted parallel in time, as shown at <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>(a parallel format). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In the serial format <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, time is indicated at time <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight>, movie &num;<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is indicated at <highlight><bold>916</bold></highlight>. A list of DTV receiver identifications (IDs) scheduled to receive movie &num;<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>914</bold></highlight> precedes movie &num;<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>916</bold></highlight> in the broadcast. Preceding the list of DTV receivers IDs <highlight><bold>914</bold></highlight> is movie &num;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and preceding movie &num;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> would be a list of DTV receiver IDs scheduled to receive movie &num;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (not shown). In this manner, DTV receiver <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> would receive movie &num;<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> if the ID for DTV receiver <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> was in the list of DTV receiver IDs for movie &num;<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>914</bold></highlight>. If DTV receiver <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> was not in the list of DTV receiver IDs for movie &num;<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>914</bold></highlight> then DTV receiver <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> would not receive movie &num;<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. For example, DTV receiver <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> may not be in the list of DTV receiver IDs scheduled to receive movie &num;<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, but instead may be in the list of DTV receiver IDs scheduled to receive movie &num;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, therefore movie &num;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> would be received and transferred to the storage area associated with DTV receiver <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> An alternative parallel format for the broadcast signal <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> could be configured as shown in <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. An increase in time is shown as time <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight>. A movie &num;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>, a movie &num;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> up to a movie n <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight> are arranged in a parallel format. Preceding the movies <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight> is a list of DTV receiver IDs for all the movies <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight>. The DTV receivers would receive and transfer, to their respective storage areas, the particular movies that were individually scheduled for each receiver. As previously discussed the MPEG standard may be used to configure the broadcast signal <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> as well as any of the other standards that well known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Thus, a novel multimedia-content selection methodology is disclosed which is based on consumer information. Although the invention is described herein with reference to specific preferred embodiments, many modifications therein will readily occur to those of ordinary skill in the art. Accordingly, all such variations and modifications are included within the intended scope of the invention as defined by the following claims. </paragraph>
