<heading lvl="1">THE FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to computer access systems, and in particular, to computer systems with selective access controlled by electronic payment mechanisms. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Technology has revolutionized our lives by simplifying many tasks for us. Moreover, with miniaturization, we take computers wherever we go in the form of notebook computers, personal digital assistants, and other techno gadgets. With these devices, we can take personal or business information with us to almost any location for access at our convenience. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This technological revolution has produced an information age in which all types and volumes of information are widely available. Accordingly, most of us expect that all business and/or personal information should be available to them anywhere and at anytime. Network communications, such as the internet and World Wide Web, facilitate this seemingly limitless ability to deliver and obtain information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Nevertheless, computer users still sometimes find themselves in places without their desktop or notebook computer, or without their personal digital assistant. Unfortunately, this situation might arise when the computer user has extra time on their hands, such as waiting at an airport or a retail shopping center. When properly equipped, people can use this otherwise lost time for making telephone calls, checking email, other communication tasks, or computing tasks. However, without a mobile phone or notebook computer, this time is wasted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Some public venues such as airports provide business suites with telephones and even capability for internet communications including email. Nevertheless, these services tend to be quite limited. Moreover, all of these arrangements create issues of access and control regarding who is using these devices, how the services are paid for, and how to protect the devices from unauthorized use. Accordingly, many computer users still yearn for complete freedom to compute and electronically communicate in public settings, such as an airport, just as they would at home or at work. </paragraph>

It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural or logical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. The following detailed description, therefore, is not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined by the appended claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Components of the present invention may be implemented in hardware via a microprocessor, programmable logic, or state machine, in firmware, or in software within a given device. In one aspect, at least a portion of the software programming is web-based and written in HTML and JAVA programming languages, including links to graphical user interfaces, such as via windows-based operating system. The components may communicate via a network using a communication bus protocol. For example, the present invention may or may not use a TCP/IP protocol suite for data transport. Other programming languages and communication bus protocols suitable for use with the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art after reading the present application. Components of the present invention may reside in software on one or more computer-readable media. The term computer-readable media as used herein is defined to include any kind of memory, volatile or non-volatile, such as floppy disks, hard disks, CD-ROMs, flash memory, read-only memory (ROM), and random access memory (RAM). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the user interfaces described herein run on a controller, computer, appliance or other device having an operating system which can support one or more applications. The operating system is stored in memory and executes on a processor. The operating system is preferably a multi-tasking operating system which allows simultaneous execution of multiple applications, although aspects of this invention may be implemented using a single-tasking operating system. The operating system employs a graphical user interface windowing environment which presents the applications or documents in specially delineated areas of the display screen called &ldquo;windows.&rdquo; Each window has its own adjustable boundaries which allow the user to enlarge or shrink the application or document relative to the display screen. Each window can act independently, including its own menu, toolbar, pointers, and other controls, as if it were a virtual display device. Other software tools may be employed via the window, such as a spreadsheet for collecting data. The operating system preferably includes a windows-based dynamic display which allows for the entry or selection of data in dynamic data field locations via an input device such as a keyboard and/or mouse. One preferred operating system is a Windows&reg; brand operating system sold by Microsoft Corporation. However, other operating systems which provide windowing environments may be employed, such as those available from Apple Corporation or IBM. In another embodiment, the operating system does not employ a windowing environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> A selective access computing system and method of the present invention enables a member of the public to privately use a computer system for a fee. The computer system preferably is located in a kiosk of an airport or retail shopping center, or private suite in a business setting or hotel. The fee is paid through an electronic payment mechanism such as an electronic credit card reader. To insure that only paying customers use the computer system, the computer system operates in a locked mode until the computer system receives a signal from the electronic payment mechanism that the customer has payment authorization to use the computer system. In this locked mode, a screen saver on a display of the computer system informs prospective customers of services available from the computer system. Upon payment authorization, a user interface desktop is revealed and the customer uses the computer system including software applications (desktop or web-based), input/output devices such as a printer, scanner, and storage media devices, such as a disk drive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> When a customer is done using the computer system, then the customer is electronically charged a fee corresponding to the time of use and/or extent of use the software applications and input/output devices. Finally, upon the customer&apos;s termination from the computer system, the computer system returns to the locked mode with display of the screen saver until the next paying customer activates the computer system. </paragraph>

Application service provider <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> identifies a software application that is operable in system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and that is provided by a service provider through web browser <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and network communication link <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The appearance of desktop <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> is not limited to the arrangement shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. For example, desktop <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> optionally appears as a Windows-based desktop with icons representing keyword functions for activating particular software applications or input/output devices <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Peripherals monitor <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> includes a set of keyword functions for activating a peripheral input/output device associated with each keyword, such as printer function <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, scanner function <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, copier function <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>, other function <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>, and fax function <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>. Finally, storage media monitor <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> includes a set of keyword functions for activating a storage media device such as CD read/write drive <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and disk drive <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> for importing and exporting data to and from system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> relative to diskette and/or CD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Storage media monitor <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> optionally is used for temporarily using a software program from a CD or diskette for operation on computer workstation <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. For example, the software program can temporarily fully installed onto computer workstation <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> during the authorized user&apos;s use of system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and then fully uninstalled from computer workstation <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as part of the log off process from system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the software program is operated from CD read/write drive <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and/or disk drive <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> with only a minimal number of software components temporarily loaded onto computer workstation <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Computer workstation <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> optionally includes its own security measures such as anti-virus software to protect itself from malicious hackers and users. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> A method <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> of public access computing of the present invention uses system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and permits a user to operate computer workstation <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for accessing software programs in program tools monitor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and peripheral input/output devices <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in peripherals monitor <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. Method <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> includes a first step <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> in which system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> rests in a locked mode while displaying screen saver <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> on display <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. In the locked mode, computer workstation <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is up and running but desktop <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) including program tools monitor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and peripherals monitor cannot be viewed or operated by a user at computer workstation <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Instead, screen saver <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) is provided in place of desktop <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and merely illustrates what services are available from system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In a next step <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> of method <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, the user enters login information such as a temporary user id or account number, and obtains authorization to pay for services from system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with computer workstation <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> through financial instrument reader <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. In particular, a user passes a credit card, debit card, or other electronic financial instrument through financial instrument reader <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, which contacts financial database <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to verify the user&apos;s ability to pay electronically for the services. Upon a successful payment authorization, financial instrument reader <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> sends a signal to computer workstation <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that the user is financially authorized to use system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In response, the next step <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> of method <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> includes unlocking system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and removing screen saver <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> to reveal desktop <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. At the same time, in a related step <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, controller <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> starts system usage timer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> for tracking the amount of time that user uses system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> With desktop <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) available to the user, the user then selects a tool(s) such as software program and/or peripheral device by activating one of the listed keyword functions in program tools monitor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and/or peripherals monitor <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and operates those tools (step <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>). In a related step (<highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>), for each program request and/or peripheral request, usage is tracked with input/output request counter <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. After or during operation of the tools of system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a user saves data from use of the software programs and/or peripheral devices to storage media such as a CD through CD read/write drive <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> or a diskette through disk drive <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The user then logs off system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, terminating use of any software programs and/or peripheral devices. This action triggers system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to return to a locked mode in which desktop <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> is inaccessible and screen saver <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> appears on user interface <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of display <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. At this point, resource cost calculator <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> combines data from system usage timer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and input/output request counter <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> to produce a total cost for the use of system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>). In a final step (<highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>), system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> charges the user this cost through financial instrument reader <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and auxiliary printer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> prints out a receipt for the user. Alternatively, as previously mentioned, system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> bills the user through an established account associated with the account number entered through login function <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> A system and method for public access computing of the present invention permits computer users to access their favorite software programs and peripheral devices without having their own computer or devices with them. System <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> conveniently provides a computing system that has all the necessary tools for user and in convenient locations such as airports, retail shopping centers, libraries, etc. The computer user pays for this service through an electronic financial instrument such as a credit card, alleviating the necessity for a supervisor or cashier to manage the computer system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and/or receive payment for services. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> While specific embodiments have been illustrated and described, herein for purposes of description of the preferred embodiment, it will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that a wide variety of alternate and/or equivalent implementations may be substituted for the specific embodiments shown and described without departing from the scope of the present invention.
