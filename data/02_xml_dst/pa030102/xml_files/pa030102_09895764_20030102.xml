<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to rescue devices, in particular, to a portable rescue device using cinch cords for ease of use by firefighters and other rescue personnel. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Although the prior art shows rescue devices, none are believed to illustrate the type of device disclosed and claimed. In a fire or other emergency situation, often it is extremely difficult to extricate persons therefrom, particularly persons who are disoriented or unconscious. Such persons are unable to assist in their own rescue. If the rescuer grabs, for example, the person&apos;s clothing, it often will simply slide off said person. Sometimes, such person&apos;s may not even be wearing clothing, as in a night time sleeping situation or where the clothing is burned off due to flames or heat of a fire. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In addition, if the person has bulky equipment on, as for example, in the case of a firefighter overcome with smoke or lack of oxygen, the equipment can catch on debris in a smoke filled room. Thus, there is a need for a rescue device which can prevent such interference with debris and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Further, in a smoke filled environment, visibility may often be essentially zero and a rescuer may be unable to count on assistance. Therefore, any rescue device needs to be easily carried, deployed and used by a single rescuer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The present invention meets these needs. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is an object of this invention to provide a rescue device with is portable and can be carried in a pocket or rescue bag. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is another object of this invention to provide a rescue device which can be deployed and used by a single rescuer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is a further object of this invention to provide a rescue device which encompasses a person and that person&apos;s clothing or equipment to prevent said clothing or equipment from catching on debris and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Further objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent as the following description proceeds and the features of novelty which characterize this invention will be pointed out with particularity in the claims annexed to and forming a part of this specification. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Referring more particularly to the drawings by characters of reference, FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> disclose one embodiment of a rescue device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprising a stretcher <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> having a cinch cord <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> extending about a periphery <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of stretcher <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Cinch cord <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is slidably captured by a plurality of passageways <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> preferably created by looping and sewing portions of periphery <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> over on itself as best illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The use of a plurality of passageways <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> creates one or more cutouts <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> about periphery <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> each of which provides hand access to cinch cord <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Cutouts <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are preferably about eight to ten inches (8&Prime;-10&Prime;) wide to allow for easy hand access. In addition, the device preferably includes at least four cutouts <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, two cutouts <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> positioned at ends <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and two cutouts <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> positioned at midpoints <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of each side. Most preferably, additional cutouts <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are provided for additional handholds if needed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Stretcher <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is made of a cloth-like, foldable material, preferably a fire retardant material such as Rip-Stop Nomax&reg;, and is a flourescent or reflective color for visibility. For size, stretcher <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is preferably six to eight feet long and three to five feet wide, most preferably about seven feet long and four feet wide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Cinch cord <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is preferably a six to nine millimeter climbing rope, also preferably a bright color such as a day glo orange. Those skilled in the art will recognize other materials suitable for such use, including, but not limited to, webbing materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The use of cloth like foldable material permits the user to simply fold device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> into a small pack which can be carried in a pocket or in a rescue bag. To deploy, device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is layed out as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. A patient <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to be rescued is simply rolled onto device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, clothing, equipment and all. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, rescuers <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> grab cinch cord <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and lift whereby the cinch cord action brings periphery <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and tightens it around patient <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> thus forming a cocoon about patient <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. In an emergency, only one rescuer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is needed as pulling on cinch cord <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at one cutout <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> accomplishes the same cocooning effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> While two or more rescuers are preferred since patient <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> can be more easily carried to safety, again, in an emergency, one rescuer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> can drag patient <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to safety. Further, the use of the preferred sizes allows rescuers <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to handle either an adult or two or more smaller persons such as children. The one or more rescuers <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> can use device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> either in a walking mode or in a crawling mode if required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Stretcher <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, encompasses patient <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> with clothing, equipment, extremities such as arms and legs, all captured within the interior of folded up stretcher <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which prevents same from catching on debris as the patient is taken to safety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In an alternate embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the addition of one or more flexible frames <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which, once device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is removed from a pocket or bag, causes automatic deployment of same. Frames <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are preferably made from wire but those skilled in the art will recognize that other flexible materials are suitable for this application. This assists the rescuer deployment in adverse conditions such as heavy smoke, heat, debris covered floors and with tactile difficulties caused by heavy gloves used, for example, by firefighters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Although only certain embodiments have been illustrated and described, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications may be made therein without departing from the spirit of the invention or from the scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
