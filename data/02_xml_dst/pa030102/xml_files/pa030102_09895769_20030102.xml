<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A pneumatic clutch assembly comprises: a hub having a flange and a cylindrical wall, an inner plurality of longitudinally extending splines which project outwardly from the cylindrical wall, a longitudinally extending passage in the hub for receiving a shaft, and a plurality of driver plates slideably disposed on the splines and biased in a spaced relationship. A driving ring includes a plurality of inwardly extending splines on which a plurality of spaced circular friction plates are slideably disposed and positioned between the driver plates. A holding plate is superposed over the driver plates at the distal end of the hub to capture the driver plates and friction plates and secured to the hub by fasteners. An annular spring is positioned in each recess formed between two driver plates, and between the innermost driver plate and the flange. These springs maintain separation between the driver plates until the holding-plate fasteners are torqued down, compressing the annular springs. A pressure plate is interposed between the holding plate and the driver plates, and an inflatable tube is interposed between the pressure plate and the holding plate for selectively applying pressure to the driver plates, engaging and disengaging the clutch. To ease assembly of the clutch, selected splines on the hub extend substantially over an uncompressed bias dimension to the extent that the outermost driver plate is provided with sufficient spline contact to align the plate on the splines before the holding plate is secured to the hub. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to improvements in a disk clutch mechanism. More particularly, this invention relates to a pneumatic disk clutch used in power transmission. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A disk clutch typically comprises a cylindrical drive hub, at least one annular driven plate, a plurality of annular driver plates and driven ring. All plates are concentrically disposed about the hub. For purposes of description the hub is identified as the drive element and the ring as the driven element. The drive and driven elements of a disk clutch of the types described herein could be reversed depending on the application. In other words the hub could be the output or driven element and the ring could be the input or driver element. A back plate and a holding plate attach to the hub at their respective ends in order to capture the driver plate or plates and the driven plates. The disk clutch also has some form of actuator that forces the plates into contact, causing the driver plates to hold the driven plate. The clutch operates on the friction force that develops when a driven plate is held between two driver plates. A common method of connecting the driver plates to the drive hub is by means of a plurality of splines, which force the driver plates to rotate with the hub but allow them to slide longitudinally unless otherwise restrained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Proper alignment of the driver plates on the drive hub is critical to a properly functioning clutch. Proper alignment may be easily achieved in smaller clutches where the components are few and easy to handle, but in large torque applications, a series of large, heavy, driver and driven plates are employed. For example, in an oil drilling operation, the driver plates can weigh ninety pounds each and the holding plate that captures the driver plates and driven plates can weigh one-hundred-and-seventy pounds or more. As the number and weight of the individual plates increase, so does the difficulty of assembling the clutch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Particularly in applications where in-place assembly may be required, as in the oil field, it is importance to be able to assemble a clutch quickly and with minimal assistance. Given the size and weight of the clutch&apos;s component parts, however, alignment of the driver plates on the splines of the drive hub while maneuvering the holding plate and various intermediate components is not easy. One solution is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,439,083, entitled CLUTCH, and issued on Aug. 8, 1995, which is by reference incorporated here in its entirety. This patent discloses using a plurality of springs to maintain separation between driver plates during assembly. Once all of the driver plates have been properly assembled, the holding plate is installed and its retaining fasteners tightened, thereby compressing the springs and moving the driving (and driven) plates into their operating configuration. A selected group of hub splines extend sufficiently in length so as to engage the driver plates and the holding plate before the fasteners are tightened, in this way enabling the plates to be properly aligned even with the springs in an uncompressed condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Despite the advantages of the improved design described above, the springs themselves are generally coiled springs that must be fitted into recesses formed in the driver plates during assembly. This configuration requires that each driver plate be carefully aligned so that the underlying spring is properly received into the recess, and where a spring is misaligned or jarred out of position, at remedial disassembly and reassembly will be required. Needed is a pneumatic clutch that allows for spring-biased alignment during assembly that does not have these shortcomings. The present invention provides for just such a clutch. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A pneumatic clutch assembly is provided that includes: a cylindrical hub forming a longitudinally extending passage for receiving a drive shaft, a first plurality of longitudinal splines extending outwardly from the hub, a plurality of floating driver plates that engage these hub splines, a plurality of spaced friction (i.e., driven) plates that are positioned between the driver plates, a flange back plate secured to the hub at a first end and a holding plate secured to the hub at a second end so as to capture the driver plates and the friction plates between them. The driver plates are biased in a spaced relationship by annular springs such as a wave spring, Belleville spring, wire spring or resilient spring. that is interposed between the back plate and first (nearest) driver plate. A spacer ring is concentrically disposed about the hub between the end of the hub splines and the back plate. A split spacer ring is used for certain applications, such as retrofits, where separation of the back plate from the hub for spacer-ring installation may be difficult. Additional annular springs may be interposed between the driver plates to bias them into a spaced relationship as well. An annular driving ring is concentrically disposed about the driver and friction plates, and includes a second plurality of longitudinal splines. These driving-ring splines extend inwardly to engage the plurality of spaced friction plates. As should be apparent, the friction plates have an inner diameter large enough to avoid contact with the hub splines. In addition, the inner diameter is large enough to permit installation of the annular springs between the driver plates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> To apply pressure to the driver plates, an annular pressure plate is interposed between the holding plate and the outermost driver plate (i.e., the farthest from the back plate). An annular inflatable tube is interposed between the pressure plate and the holding plate for selectively applying pressure to the pressure plate, which in turn applies pressure to the driver plates and friction plates. During operation, the air tube is inflated so as to force these plates together. As the driver plates and friction plates are pushed together, sufficient friction forces develop between the plates to engage the clutch, that is, cause the friction plates to impart rotary motion to the driving ring. The air tube includes an inlet with a valve through which the air tube may be inflated or deflated to engage or disengage the clutch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Whenever the clutch is assembled, the various plates are added, one at a time, in their proper order. To ease the alignment process during clutch assembly, selected hub splines extend substantially over an uncompressed bias dimension so that the outermost (last-assembled) driver plate is provided with spline contact sufficient to align the plate on the extended splines, notwithstanding that the substantially uncompressed annular springs are still holding the driver plates in a spaced relationship. When the other clutch components have been assembled, the holding plate is installed and its fasteners are secured to bring the holding plate into its operational, seated condition, a process that also compresses the annular springs and brings the driver plates and friction plates into closer proximity to each other.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The present invention is described by reference to drawings showing one or more examples of how the invention can be made and used. In these drawings, reference characters are used throughout the several views to indicate like or corresponding parts. The drawings are not necessarily to scale and the proportions of certain parts have been exaggerated to better illustrate details and features of the invention. The present invention will be described by referring to apparatus showing various examples of how the invention can be made and used. Like reference characters are used throughout the several views of the drawing to indicate like corresponding parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The preferred embodiments of the invention will now be described by reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> in which the annular springs are illustrated in the form of wave springs. Referring generally to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the numeral <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> designates a pneumatic clutch assembly according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. (Note that minor variation in the illustrated embodiment from drawing to drawing represent insubstantial differences unless otherwise noted.) In general, the clutch assembly is operable to selectively transfer rotational movement from drive shaft <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (and hub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) to driving ring <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> (or vice versa) by engaging the clutch components. Referring specifically to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, which is a cross-sectional view of the pneumatic clutch hub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> taken along line A-A shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, hub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> includes a cylindrical wall <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, a first end <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and a second end <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Hub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> also includes two shoulders, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, to which back plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and holding plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) are respectively secured. Note that while hub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is described as having a first end and a second end, these are simply the locations where the back plate and the holding plate are secured, and there is no requirement that the actual hub not in some way extend past these ends, if it is desirable to do so. Annular back plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> has a substantially flat, inwardly facing surface <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and is secured to shoulder <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of hub first end <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> by threaded fasteners <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Although a plurality of threaded fasteners <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is preferred, in accordance with the present invention, other fastener types, or a single fastener, may also be used where appropriate. In an alternate embodiment (not shown), back plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is an integrally formed portion of hub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (and hence &ldquo;secured&rdquo;). Cylindrical wall <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> defines a longitudinally extending passage <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> for receiving a drive shaft <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Drive shaft <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> imparts rotary motion to cylindrical wall <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> (or is imparted with rotary motion) through a key <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. A plurality of longitudinally-extending spline teeth <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (or simply &ldquo;splines&rdquo;) project radially outward from the cylindrical wall <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of hub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Referring now specifically to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>, a plurality of spaced floating circular driver plates <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> engage hub splines <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and are concentrically disposed about the cylindrical wall <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Floating driver plates <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are splined, that is, fixed in a radial fashion by, but free to move longitudinally along the splines <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Thus, driver plates <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are slidable axially of hub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. An annular driving ring <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is concentrically disposed about the circumference of driver plates <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> for imparting rotary motion to a piece of equipment. It should be noted, however, that in accordance with the present invention, rotary motion can be imparted to the equipment either through the shaft <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or though the driving ring <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Driving ring <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> includes a second plurality of longitudinally extending splines <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> (&ldquo;ring splines&rdquo;) and a means to secure the driving ring <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to the equipment using or supplying the rotational motion (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The ring splines <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> face inwardly toward hub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and engage a plurality of spaced circular friction driven plates <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> that are concentrically disposed about cylindrical wall <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated embodiment, friction plates <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are fixed in a radial fashion but are free to slide longitudinally along ring splines <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Friction plates <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are interposed between driver plates <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, with friction plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> positioned between back plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and first driver plate <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, friction plate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> positioned between the first driver plate <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and a second driver plate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and friction plate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> positioned between the second driver plate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and a third driver plate <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. (For the purposes of this disclosure, the various plates are numbered according to their order of assembly, with lower numbers therefore designating the innermost plates, that is, those closer to back plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4, 5</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, in a preferred embodiment the driver plates <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and friction plates <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are captured on the hub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by an annular holding plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Holding plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is secured to the shoulder <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of hub cylindrical wall <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> by threaded fasteners <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Again, other types of fasteners may be used as well. In a preferred embodiment, shim <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is disposed between shoulder <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and holding plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. An annular pressure plate <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is interposed between holding plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and outermost driver plate <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to apply pressure (collectively) to the driver plates <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and friction plates <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Annular pressure plate <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is concentrically disposed about cylindrical wall <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. In addition, an inflatable tubular ring <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is interposed between the pressure plate <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the holding plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for selectively applying pressure to the driver plates <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and friction plates <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Holding plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> includes an annular recess <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> with vertically extending sides <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> to confine air tube <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> between holding plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and pressure plate <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Air tube <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is inflated through inlet <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and valve <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which extend outwardly through an opening <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the holding plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. A pneumatic medium <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is used to inflate tube <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. Note that although the present invention is described in terms of a pneumatic embodiment, suitable fluids other than air may also be used and such alternate embodiments are considered equivalent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> When air tube <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> inflates, driver plates <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are pushed along the splines <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of hub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> toward back plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. As the driver plates <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> push against the flange <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the hub, friction plates <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are held tightly between the driver plates. When the friction plates <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are held tightly between the driver plates <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> friction forces develop between the respective plates, which allow the friction plates to impart the rotary motion of the driver plates to the driving ring <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. These friction forces, however, generate heat and can cause warpage in the driving plates and friction plates. To dissipate this heat, hub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> includes cooling air passages <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Cooling passages <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> extend through flange back plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, hub cylindrical wall <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, and holding plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to provide an unobstructed air path through clutch assembly <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The number and size of the cooling air passages <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> may be increased or decreased as the need arises. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view of the pneumatic clutch assembly <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> taken along line A-A in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, illustrating the clutch in an alignment configuration. Here, the term alignment configuration simply refers to that stage of clutch assembly where all of the driver plates and annular springs have been installed, but the springs are still substantially uncompressed. Annular springs are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> as wave springs <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> in their substantially uncompressed form, producing an exaggerated spaced relationship between the driver plates <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, and between driver plate <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and back plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The springs are referred to as &ldquo;substantially uncompressed&rdquo; notwithstanding any minor compression of the wave springs that may occur in the alignment configuration, caused for example by the weight of the plate stack even when the fasteners <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> securing holding plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> have not yet been completely installed. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, then, shows driver plates <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in alignment configuration during assembly. The driver plates are biased into a spaced relationship by a plurality of circular wave springs <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) before fasteners <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are secured (i.e., torqued to proper operational configuration) to seat holding plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> on shoulder <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Wave springs <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are disposed in gaps <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>), respectively, these annular gaps being the space between the hub splines <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the inner diameter of friction plates <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, ands <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view, taken along line A-A in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, of the pneumatic clutch assembly in operational configuration, that is, the clutch with the holding plate fasteners tightened. Note that the term operational configuration refers to the clutch so assembled, regardless of whether it is engaged or disengaged. Note also that the terms substantially compressed will be used to refer to the state of the wave springs when the clutch is in the operational configuration, notwithstanding the fact that a small amount of additional compression will take place when the clutch is engaged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, which is an exploded cross-sectional view of a pneumatic clutch according to an embodiment of the present invention, spring <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is captured between back plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and driver plate <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Spring <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is captured between driver plates <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, respectively. Likewise, spring <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is captured between driver plates <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, respectively. (Note that for clarity, the wave springs are shown in full perspective rather than cut-away.) The interposition of the wave springs serves to maintain the driver plates in a spaced relationship (i.e. more so than if separated only by the friction plates). In the alignment configuration during assembly, this relationship is exaggerated until the holding plate fasteners are secured, seating holding plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and placing the clutch into its operational configuration. During operation, the spatial relationship between driver plates exists to a much lesser extent until the plates are forced together by inflation of the air tube <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> To ease the alignment process during assembly of the clutch <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, selected hub splines <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> extend substantially over an uncompressed bias dimension. As best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, where holding plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is shown in an unseated position, the uncompressed bias distance is defined as the dimension along the hub between the first driver plate installed during assembly and the last, inclusive of their thickness, measured when the last driver plate is installed and the clutch is in the alignment configuration during assembly. The selected splines <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are formed to extend substantially over the uncompressed bias dimension so that the outermost driver plate is provided with spline contact sufficient to align the plate on the extended splines, notwithstanding that the wave springs are still holding the driver plates in a spaced relationship. Note that &ldquo;substantially over the uncompressed bias dimension&rdquo; means that full contact throughout the width of each driver plate is not required. Furthermore, the uncompressed bias dimension may depend somewhat on whether the wave springs compress slightly during assembly, as mentioned above. Note that in the preferred embodiment, only a portion of the splines <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are extended splines <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. To prevent obstruction of cooling passageways <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, splines <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the vicinity of cooling passageways are limited in length to the compressed axial dimension (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, where shorter splines are denominated by the numeral <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>). Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the compressed axial dimension is defined as the spline length necessary to operationally engage all of the driver plates&mdash;in this embodiment plates <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>&mdash;when springs <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are substantially compressed after holding plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is seated and the clutch is in its operational configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> It can be appreciated that in-place assembly of the clutch is difficult. The holding plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> on a twenty-four inch clutch typically weighs one-hundred-and-seventy pounds or more, and driver plates <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> each weigh ninety pounds or more. To assemble the clutch <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, driver plates <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> have to be lined up on the splines <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and then pressure plate <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, tubular ring <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and holding plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> have to be aligned around the hub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, while wave springs <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are disposed in gaps <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. In view of the weight of the component parts of the clutch assembly <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, it can be appreciated that alignment of the driver plates <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> on the splines <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the hub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> while maneuvering the holding plate and various intermediate components is not an easy task. Selected spline extensions <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> allow alignment of the outermost driver plate <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> on splines <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> before the pressure plate <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, tubular ring <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, and holding plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are fit-up for installation over driver plates <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The use of the annular springs represents a significant improvement over prior methods. More than satisfactory in performance, the annular springs are safer and easier to install than ordinary coiled springs, and do not require that the driver plates be recessed to hold them in position. Shown in plan view in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is the wave spring embodiment <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the present inventions. Though the split configuration in this embodiment is preferred, it is not required by the present invention. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>alternative embodiments of the annular spring of the present invention are illustrated. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>four belleville springs <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are shown. Assembled in series. It is envisioned that one or more than four belleville springs (or other types of annular springs) could be used as required. For examples more than one wave springs could be used between each set of driver plates. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>wave shaped annular wire spring <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is shown for use in clutch assemblies in place of wave springs. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>an annular resilient spring <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>is shown formed from elastomeric material or other suitable materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> A stepped spacer ring <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> inserted substantially as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> ensures that there is no unwanted lateral migration of the wave spring <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, where (as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>) a gap exists between the end of the hub splines <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (including extended splines <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>) and the back plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. (A perspective and a plan view of the spacer ring are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, respectively.) Although the stepped spacer ring is preferred, other configurations may be used as well. And in an alternate embodiment, a split spacer ring <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> such as the one shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, can be used where installation could not be otherwise accomplished, such as in retrofit situations. The use of split ring <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> therefore permits the rebuilding of existing clutches to take advantage of the annular-spring technology. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Once the clutch <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is assembled, air tube <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is selectively inflated through inlet <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and valve <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to exert pressure on driver plates <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and friction plates <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. As the pressure on the driver plates and friction plates is increased, friction forces between the driver plates and friction plates are sufficient to allow the friction plates to transmit rotary motion to the driving ring <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. It should be understood that clutch assembly <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be powered either through drive shaft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, as described above, or through driving ring <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. If powered by the driving ring <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the friction forces that develop between the driver plates and the friction plates allow the driver plates to impart rotary motion to the shaft <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Even though numerous characteristics and advantages of the present invention have been set forth in the foregoing description together with details of the structure and function of the invention, the disclosure is illustrative only. It should be understood that pneumatic clutch assembly could be used in many different applications requiring a wide range of torque ratings. In applications requiring a large torque rating, the number and/or diameter of the driver plates and the friction plates will increase. Likewise, in applications requiring a low torque rating the number and/or diameter of the driver plates and the friction plates may decrease. Various changes may be made in detail, especially in matters of shape, size, and arrangement of the parts, within the principles of the invention to the full extent indicated by the broad general meaning of the terms used. The restrictive description and drawings of the specific examples above do not point out what an infringement of this patent would be, but are to provide at least one explanation of how to make and use the invention. The limits of the invention and the bounds of the patent protection are measured by and defined in the appended claims. </paragraph>
