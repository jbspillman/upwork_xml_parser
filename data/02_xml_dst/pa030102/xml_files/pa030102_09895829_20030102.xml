<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to electrical systems, and more particularly to high current electrical systems in which a component thereof is subject to replacement. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Electrical systems frequently include replaceable components, as for example fuses. In high current electrical circuits having sufficient voltage, the removal of a component may result in ionization of the air, resulting in an arc discharge as the component looses contact with its mounting member. Arcs of this nature can carry substantial energy, which may result in sufficient heat generation to melt or otherwise damage the component electrical interface and/or its mounting, as well as posing a possible danger of injury to the person performing the extraction. This arc discharge situation, with its concurrent potential for damage and/or injury, may also occur when a component is replaced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> An example of a high current circuit application is the modern automobile. A plethora of electrical devices are now typical in present automobiles, each creating a current draw. These high current electrical circuits have capacitive and inductive aspects which can add transient bursts of current and/or voltage to the circuit. Further, because of the power demand placed upon 12 to 14 volt D.C. automotive electrical systems, consideration is being given to standardize to a higher voltage, for example a 42 volt D.C. electrical system. Higher voltage automotive electrical systems offer reduced current at the same power demand, but the higher voltage may tend to favor arcing when electrical components are proximally separated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, what is needed in the art of high current electrical circuits is a combined system featuring component and personnel protections in the form of fusing, disconnection, and current limitation. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The present invention is a high current disconnect system featuring high current fusing, manual disconnect, and current limitation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The high current disconnect system includes a fuse, current limiting resistor, a manual disconnection unit, and a holder having a pair of connections for connecting the high current disconnect system to an electrical (ie., automotive) circuit. The fuse, which provides overload protection, is seated in a fuse compartment of the holder and is selectively removable therefrom. The manual disconnection unit is wired in series with the fuse and provides a user selectable circuit interrupt. A first portion of the manual disconnection unit is located in a disconnect compartment of the holder and has the aforesaid series wiring connection, while a second portion thereof is selectively connectable to the first portion, wherein when in the connected state the path therethrough is closed, but when in the disconnected state, the path therethrough is open. The current limiting resistor is wired in parallel with the manual disconnection unit (and also in series with the fuse), and is located in a resistor compartment of the holder. The current limiting resistor provides a current limited path for capacitive and/or inductive elements of the connected electrical circuit during charge or disconnect. In this regard, it will be noted that the parallel arrangement of the manual disconnect and current limiting resistor provides a very low resistance, high current path when the manual disconnect is in its connected state, and a current limited path when the manual disconnect is in its disconnected state. Each of the aforesaid compartments are distinct and a respective cover is provided for each compartment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The second portion of the manual disconnection unit includes a housing and a bussing assembly. The bussing assembly includes a pair of second terminals which erupt from the housing and a buss bar located within the housing which provides a very low resistance electrical connection between the first terminals. The first portion of the manual disconnection unit includes a pair of first terminals which are configured to connect to the second terminals by a slidable interface therebetween. The housing is structured to adjacently occlude the compartment covers when the first terminals are interfaced with the second terminals (that is, when the manual disconnection unit is in the connected state). Accordingly, to access the fuse or the current limiting resistor, the removable portion of the manual disconnection unit must be separated from the holder (whereupon the manual disconnection unit is in the disconnected state). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Benefits of the present invention include: current limitation and electrical isolation during service of the electrical circuit; multitudinal fuse configurations; small, application specific configurable package; expandability not limited by the number of electrical circuits involved; high reliability involving minimal cabling and components; adaptability to any fusing system; and suitability for integration with existing pre-validated components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a single package high current manual disconnect system including manual disconnection, fusing and current limitation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> This and additional objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become clearer from the following specification of a preferred embodiment.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the Drawing, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> depicts a preferred example of a high current manual disconnect system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, including a holder <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having a fuse compartment <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a disconnect compartment <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and a resistor compartment <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>; a fuse <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> located in the fuse compartment; a manual disconnection unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> having a first (base) portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> located in the disconnect compartment and a second (removable) portion <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>; and a current limiting resistor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> located in the resistor compartment. Each of the compartments is covered by a removable cover: the fuse compartment <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by a fuse compartment cover <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the disconnect compartment by a disconnect compartment cover <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and the resistor compartment <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> by a resistor compartment cover <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. Each compartment cover <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is snappingly interfaced with a holder body <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the holder <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> so as to be selectively removable therefrom. The compartment covers <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>serve environmental protection, electrical isolation, and prevention of accidental electrical contact by personnel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The holder body <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is composed of an electrical insulator, as for example glass filled thermoplastic. The holder body <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>has attached thereto a pair of contacts <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to which is respectively connected wires <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> from an external electrical circuit, as for example a high current automotive electrical circuit. Preferably, the contacts <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are of the threaded stud and nut type, but may be otherwise configured. Additional contacts <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>are also provided, wherein the fuse <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is connected to contacts <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the first portion <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is connected to contacts <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and the current limiting resistor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is connected to contacts <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>. A first buss bar <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>connects contact <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to contact <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, a second buss bar <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>connects contact <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to contact <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, and a third buss bar <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>connects contact <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>to contact <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. A preferred holder is a MEGA&reg; Fuse fuseholder manufactured by Littelfuse of Des Plaines, Ill., which features the ability to customize the holder body by addition or deletion of compartments with appropriate bussing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> As further indicated by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the preferred example of the manual disconnect system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is wired as follows. The fuse <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which provides circuit overload protection, is seated in the fuse compartment <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and is selectively removable therefrom by operation of contacts <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The manual disconnection unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is wired in series with the fuse <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and provides a user selectable circuit interrupt. In this regard, the first portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> thereof is located in the disconnect compartment and has a left first terminal <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> connected to the contact <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and a right first terminal <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> connected to contact <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>(note that the left and right first terminals do not mutually contact each other), while the second portion <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> thereof is selectively connectable to the first portion so as to selectively close the electrical path between contacts <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The current limiting resistor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is wired in parallel with the manual disconnection unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (and also in series with the fuse <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>), and is located in the resistor compartment <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In operation of the electrical circuit of the preferred example of the manual disconnect system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the fuse opens the circuit if the current becomes larger then a predetermined maximum. The current limiting resistor provides a current limited path for capacitive and/or inductive elements of the connected electrical circuit during charge or disconnect. The choice of resistor is determined by the amount of circuit capacitance/inductance, circuit charge/discharge time constant, and maximum circuit safe charge current. The manual disconnection unit provides a high current, very low resistance current path for powering the circuit. In this regard, it will be noted that the parallel arrangement of the manual disconnection unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and current limiting resistor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> provides for components to be charged so that even as the first and second portions of the manual disconnection unit are separated, removal the fuse will not involve arcing, as all components having capacitance and inductance will be charged/discharged under current limited conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The second portion <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the manual disconnection unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> includes a housing <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and a bussing assembly <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The bussing assembly <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> includes left and right second terminals <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> which erupt from a bottom wall <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the housing <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and further includes a buss bar <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> located within the housing and connected to the left and right first terminals so as to provide a very low resistance electrical connection therebetween. A pivotally mounted handle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is connected to the housing <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> for grasping opposite the bottom wall. The first portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the manual disconnection unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> includes the aforementioned pair of left and right second terminals <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> which are configured to connect to the left and right first terminals <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> by a slidable interface. The preferred form of left and right second terminals <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are male pin terminals, and the preferred form of left and right first terminals <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are female barrel terminals, as for example RADSOK&reg; electrical connectors manufactured by Konnektech Division of K&amp;K Stamping of Fraser, Mich. The disconnection cover <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is provided with a pair of holes <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> through which the left and right second terminals <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> pass so that they may be connected with the left and right first terminals <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, as shown at <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> When the second portion <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the manual disconnection unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is mated to its first portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the manual disconnection unit is in its connected state, and electricity passes under very low resistance therethrough. When the second portion <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the manual disconnection unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is unmated from its first portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> by a user pulling upon the handle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, the manual disconnection unit is in its disconnected state, and electricity cannot pass therethrough (however, current limited by the current limiting resistor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> can alternatively pass parallel thereto). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The housing <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is structured to adjacently occlude the fuse, disconnect and resistor compartment covers <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, when the manual disconnection unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is in the connected state, as shown at <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Accordingly, to service the fuse (or the first portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the manual disconnection unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> or the current limiting resistor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>), the manual disconnection unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> must be in the disconnected state, whereat the removable portion of the manual disconnection unit is separated from the holder, so that the covers may be removed (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> To those skilled in the art to which this invention appertains, the above described preferred embodiment may be subject to change or modification. Such change or modification can be carried out without departing from the scope of the invention, which is intended to be limited only by the scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
