<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention is concerned with semiconductor manufacturing, and is more particularly concerned with apparatus for storing carriers in which semiconductor substrates are stored. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Semiconductor devices are made on substrates, such as silicon wafers or glass plates, for use in computers, monitors, and the like. These devices are made by a sequence of fabrication steps, such as thin film deposition, oxidation or nitration, etching, polishing, and thermal and lithographic processing. Although multiple steps may be performed in a single processing station, substrates must be transported between processing stations for at least some of the fabrication steps. Substrates are stored in open cassettes or sealed pods (hereinafter collectively referred to as &ldquo;substrate carriers&rdquo;) for transfer between processing stations and other locations. Although substrate carriers may be carried manually between processing stations, the transfer of substrate carriers is typically automated. For example, a substrate carrier may be transported to a processing station in an automatic guided vehicle (AGV), and then loaded from the AGV onto a loading platform at the processing station by a robot. Another robot may extract a substrate from the substrate carrier and transport the substrate into a processing chamber at the processing station. When the fabrication steps are complete, the substrate is loaded back into the substrate carrier. Once all the substrates have been processed and returned to the substrate carrier, the substrate carrier is removed from the loading platform and transported to another location by the AGV. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Before or after extraction of substrates from the substrate carrier for processing, the substrate carrier may be stored on a storage shelf that is provided adjacent the processing station, or at a stocker unit that stores substrate carriers for a bay of processing stations. It is known to use a robot to place the substrate carrier on the storage shelf and to remove the substrate carrier from the storage shelf. Because automatic transport is employed, it is necessary that the storage shelf be very precisely aligned and positioned relative to the carrier transport robot and/or relative to other elements adjacent the processing station. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A loading and storage station installed adjacent to a processing station is disclosed in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/201,737 (AMAT No. 2862), entitled &ldquo;Apparatus for Storing and Moving a Cassette&rdquo;. The &apos;737 patent application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The loading and storage station of the &apos;737 patent application includes a plurality of storage shelves so that a substrate carrier stocking capability is provided adjacent the processing station. The loading and storage station also includes a substrate carrier handling robot for moving substrate carriers between the shelves and a docking station. As noted before, the storage shelves must be precisely aligned and positioned relative to other elements of the loading and storage station. During conventional installation of the loading and storage station, a time-consuming and labor-intensive process is undertaken for proper installation and alignment of each of the storage shelves. It would be desirable to reduce the time and effort required for installation and alignment of substrate carrier storage shelves in connection with a loading and storage station or other substrate carrier stocking facility. </paragraph>

The shelf module includes (1) a plate; and (2) a plurality of shelves attached to the plate at respective elevations, each of the shelves being adapted to store a respective substrate carrier. Also provided are (1) an upper attachment mechanism adapted to attach an upper portion of the plate to a frame of a storage location; and (2) a lower attachment mechanism adapted to attach a lower portion of the plate to the frame of the storage location. At least one of the upper attachment mechanism and the lower attachment mechanism is adjustable so as to allow the plurality of shelves attached to the plate to be aligned to a reference as a unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a second aspect of the invention, another shelf module is provided that is similar to the shelf module of the first aspect.

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention a shelf module for a substrate carrier storage facility is formed with a plate as a main component or backbone to which plural shelves are secured. The plate or backbone is adjustably attached to a frame of the substrate carrier storage facility. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> By appropriately aligning the plate, all of the shelves that are attached to the plate may be aligned with a reference such as a platform on which a wafer carrier is placed for wafer extraction and transport to a processing tool (i.e., a docking station). An exemplary docking station for opening sealed wafer carriers is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,082,951, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. As is familiar to those who are skilled in the art, a docking station may include a platform for receiving a wafer carrier and a mechanism for removing a door from the wafer carrier so that wafers can be transferred to and from the interior of the wafer carrier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>D are side views that illustrate in schematic terms respective embodiments of the invention. In each of FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>D a shelf module <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is mounted on a frame <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of a substrate carrier storage location. The shelf module <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> includes a plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to which storage shelves <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are mounted.

Next, at step <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, the adjustable attachment mechanism (lower attachment mechanism <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in the embodiments of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A, 1B</cross-reference>; upper attachment mechanism <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in the embodiments of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1C, 1D</cross-reference>) is used to perform yaw and pitch adjustments as needed to align the shelf module <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with a reference (e.g., a docking station or some other substrate carrier delivery location). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> It should be understood that the order of the steps of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</cross-reference> may be varied. For example, the shelves <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may be attached to the frame <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> after the frame <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is mounted to the frame <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, or after the plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is mounted to the frame <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and adjusted for alignment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> An exemplary embodiment of an inventive storage module which employs the inventive shelf module and corresponds to the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> will now be described in detail with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>F-<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The embodiments of FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>B-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>D, and other embodiments, may be similarly or otherwise suitably configured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment of FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>F-<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the inventive shelf module is suspended at its upper end from a storage location frame via a gimbal joint. Pitch and yaw adjustments are made as needed around the gimbal joint to properly align the shelf module with a reference as described further below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1F</cross-reference> is an isometric view of a substrate carrier loading and storage station <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In practice the loading and storage station <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be installed adjacent to an interface to a substrate processing station (not shown) such as a loadlock or factory interface of a processing tool. The interface to the substrate processing station may include one or more docking stations D (e.g., load ports) on which a substrate carrier is positioned to permit a substrate-handling robot (not shown) associated with a substrate processing station to unload substrates from the substrate carrier and to load the substrates into the substrate processing station. Storage stations so used are referred to herein as loading and storage stations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>F, loading and storage station <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a frame <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on which a storage shelf module <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is mounted in accordance with the present invention. Also mounted on the frame <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is a loading platform <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> where cassettes may be loaded into and removed from the storage and/or loading station.

<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The male spherical post <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> has an upper section <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> that is threaded (threads not shown) so that the male spherical post <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may be threaded into a threaded receptacle <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference>) provided at location <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 6</cross-reference>A) on the plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The male spherical post <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> also has a main body <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> having a lower spherical convex surface <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 7</cross-reference>). A threaded bore <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is formed longitudinally through the male spherical post <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to receive cap screw <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Attachment block <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> has a generally rectangular body <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> (although other shapes may be used) from which a horizontally-oriented flange <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> extends horizontally adjacent to a lower surface <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>) of the rectangular body <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. It will be observed that the height of the flange <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is less than the height of the rectangular body <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to accommodate placement of male spherical post <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. In an upper surface <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of the flange <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> a spherical depression <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is formed (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>). An aperture <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> extends vertically through the flange <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> at the locus of the depression <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Extending vertically through rectangular body <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of attachment block <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are elongated apertures <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The elongated apertures <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> are provided to permit the attachment block <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to be secured to the frame <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of loading and storage station <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by means of fasteners which are not shown. The position at which the attachment block <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is secured to the frame <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is shown, for example, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Because apertures <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> are elongated in the Y axis direction (arrows <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 7</cross-reference>) the position of the attachment block <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> on the frame <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is adjustable in the Y axis direction. Other directions of adjustment may be similarly provided (if desired). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The spherical depression <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in the flange <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> forms a seat that is adapted to receive the lower spherical surface <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the male spherical post <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Aperture <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> allows cap screw <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to be threadedly inserted into the bore <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> of the male spherical post <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Thus, the upper attachment mechanism <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> may be attached to the shelf module <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> when the male spherical post <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the upper attachment module <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is threadedly mounted at location <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 6</cross-reference>A) of the shelf module&apos;s plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>.

Frame <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> thus suspendedly supports storage shelf module <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> via flange <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of attachment block <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Nevertheless, by virtue of the spherical joint formed at the interface between the spherical surface <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the male spherical post <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the spherical depression <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the attachment block <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the storage shelf module <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> remains free for adjustment about the Y axis (pitch adjustment) and about the Z axis (yaw adjustment). </paragraph>

The shelf module <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> secured to the frame <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by the lower attachment mechanism <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> During an exemplary installation of the shelf module <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> on the frame <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> the following steps are performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> First the shelves <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are secured to the plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is an exploded view that illustrates one exemplary embodiment of the attachment of a shelf <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to the plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. As stated, other techniques may be employed to attach the shelf <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to the plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> With reference to the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, features provided on the plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, such as holes <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and pins <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, very accurately determine the positioning of the shelves <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> relative to the plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and relative to each other. Accordingly, the shelf module <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be aligned as a unit relative to the docking station D (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1F</cross-reference>) or some other reference. Fasteners <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> (e.g., screws, bolts, or the like) are used to attach the shelf <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to the plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Male spherical post <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the upper attachment mechanism <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is installed (e.g., threaded into a threaded aperture) at location <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 6</cross-reference>A) on plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, either before or after the shelves <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are secured to the plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Attachment block <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is secured to the frame <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at the position illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> via fasteners (not shown) that extend through the elongated apertures <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The shelf module <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is then suspended from the attachment block <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> by seating the male spherical post <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> in the spherical depression <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> formed in flange <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of attachment block <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The shelf module <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is thus suspendedly supported by attachment block <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> while further adjustments are performed. Only one person is required to initially suspend the shelf module <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> from the attachment block <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and final adjustment of the position of the shelf module <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can also be carried out by one person unaided since the shelf module <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is supported on the attachment block <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Thus, installation and alignment of the shelf module <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is a one-person job notwithstanding the substantial size and weight of shelf module <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Turning now to the lower attachment mechanism <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>), female spherical washers <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> are placed in the pockets (e.g., pocket <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>) of the plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Further, the adjustment housing <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is secured (e.g., bolted) to the frame <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at the location shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> via fasteners (not shown) that extend through the elongated apertures <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. Subplates <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> are secured to the flanges <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> of the adjustment housing <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> by means of fasteners <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. Male spherical posts <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> are threadedly inserted into the apertures <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> of the subplates <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> until the convex spherical surfaces <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of the male spherical posts <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> contact the female spherical washers <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> in the pockets of the plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Accordingly it will be understood that the male spherical posts <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> are installed in a substantially horizontal position substantially in parallel with each other so that pitch adjustments may be made using both posts <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and yaw adjustments may be made using either post <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Adjustments may now be performed by rotating one or both of the male spherical posts <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> to align the shelf module <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with a suitable reference (e.g., the docking station D of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1F, a</cross-reference> loadport of a factory interface (not shown), etc.). Thus the male spherical posts <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> function as adjustment members. For example, the shelf module <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be aligned to the docking station D that is mounted to a factory interface (not shown). Once adjustment of the male spherical posts <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is complete, to obtain satisfactory alignment of the shelf module <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, cap screws <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> (upper attachment mechanism <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>) and <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> (lower attachment mechanism <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>) are installed to lock the shelf module <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> into position. Installation of the shelf module <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is now complete. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Because the shelves <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are pre-assembled into a precisely constructed module <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the task of aligning the shelves to a reference (e.g., docking station D) is reduced to aligning the module as a unit to the reference. The upper attachment mechanism <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> provides a single point of support with a gimbaling function, so that one person can place the module <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> on the frame <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and then have the module <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> held on the frame <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> during adjustment. Pitch and yaw adjustments are carried out by adjusting the two male spherical posts <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> of the lower attachment mechanism <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Spherical joints are provided at the upper attachment mechanism <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the lower attachment mechanism <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> so that, as the plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is moved into alignment, there is no bending or twisting of the plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> which would compromise the alignment of the individual shelves <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in the shelf module <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The shelf module <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> provided in accordance with the invention simplifies the shelf alignment process and saves labor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The foregoing description discloses only an exemplary embodiment of the invention; modifications of the above-disclosed apparatus which fall within the scope of the invention will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. For example, although the shelf module illustrated herein is shown as including three shelves, the number of shelves in the module may vary. For example, four or two shelves may be included in the shelf module. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Also, elements of the attachment mechanisms that have been shown as separate items could be integrally formed with the plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> or the frame <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>.
