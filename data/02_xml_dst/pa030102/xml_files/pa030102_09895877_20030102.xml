<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of the present invention will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In each embodiment of the present invention, regardless of whether or not an image forming apparatus of the embodiment is connected to a network, information to be used in maintenance is transferred to a maintenance service provider by using a commonly used means such as a common telephone line or mail, without using any special storage means or communicating means. By analyzing this information, the maintenance service provider can predict maintenance part replacement timings, analyze details to the occurrence of paper jamming, predict failures which easily occur in accordance with use conditions unique to the user, and reserve parts by predicting failures. That is, the maintenance service provider can take optimum actions at optimum timings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> A function which allows periodic transmission, from a user to a service provider, of machine status information, use log information, and the like to be used in the maintenance of an image forming apparatus is an optional function for the user, which is not an original image forming function. Therefore, it is difficult to install expensive parts, systems, and communication equipment at the user&apos;s expense. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> To transmit information by using the existing information transmission method, therefore, even when communication equipment is not directly connected to an image forming apparatus, the form of output information from the image forming apparatus is once converted by some converting means, and the information is transmitted by using a general information transmission method. A service provider restores the original state of the received data and uses the data in maintenance service. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> As the information transmission system, a common system such as mail or a telephone line is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> To protect maintenance information from being leaked to or altered by the third party, the maintenance information is converted into coded information which is difficult or impossible to interpret by the third party. In addition, this information is a text code or a bar code made up of numbers and alphabets, so that the information is well resistant to, e.g., contamination or noise when printed on a paper surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The present invention includes not only a case in which the apparatus is not at all connected to any communication network, but also a case in which an image forming apparatus is connected to a LAN (Local Area Network). Even in a case like this, no mail address independent of original functions of the image forming apparatus is necessary. For example, assuming this image forming apparatus is a LAN printer, information can be transferred to a service provider as long as an IP address required for normal operations as a printer is available. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Also, data such as machine status information and use log information is stored in an image forming apparatus, but these pieces of information require a large capacity. However, a large-capacity memory is expensive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, an inexpensive small-capacity memory is used. When the information storage amount reaches, e.g., 90% of the memory capacity, information is output outside the apparatus to reset the memory, and new information is written, thereby preventing capacity insufficiency of the memory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, when analyzing supplied information and detecting the state of a user s image forming apparatus, a service provider sometimes determines that various set values should be changed. In this case, the service provider sends to the user information concerning changes of set values by mailing a printed sheet of paper, by FAX transmission, or by electronic data transmission across a network. The user converts the image information sent by mail or FAX transmission into character information by OCR conversion using a scanner, and loads this character information into the image forming apparatus. Alternatively, the user receives the electronic data by a computer connected to the network and inputs the received data to the image forming apparatus. This information contains data serving as a trigger for permitting the image forming apparatus to automatically activate a setting change sequence. This data automatically activates the setting change sequence to change various set values in the image forming apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The output information from the user&apos;s image forming apparatus desirably contains the following: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> (a) Coded data to be used in maintenance </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> (b) Document I (which informs a user that data (a) represents an operation log and the like and is effective in maintenance service, so it is recommended to save this data without discarding it) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> (c) Document II (which informs a user that transmitting to the FAX number or mailing to the mail address of the service provider mentioned (the receiving side is charged in either case) is useful for predictive maintenance, and the service improves) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> When reading these documents I and II, the user is highly likely to send by FAX transmission or mail a printed-out sheet on which the coded data is printed, or at least save the data without discarding it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In particular, when the image forming apparatus does not properly operate, the user voluntarily sends the printed-out sheet by FAX transmission or mail at high possibility. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Note that even if the user loses the coded information for maintenance, the maintenance service can be performed. However, more appropriate steps can be taken with the information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The form of the coded data will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Pieces of information for use in maintenance, e.g., status information, setting information, operation log information, and error log information of an image forming apparatus are expressed by decimal numbers with breaks. These decimal numbers are converted into base-32 numbers which represent data by combining numbers 0 to 9 and alphabets A to V, and a predetermined mark is inserted in each break (e.g., &ldquo;&num;&rdquo; is inserted to represent a delimiter between information contents, and &ldquo;&plus;&rdquo; is inserted to represent a delimiter between sequences or items). By the use of this method, maintenance information which is often long can be shortened. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The information can be further shortened by using base-64 numbers by combining 0 to 9, A to Z, a to z, and symbols such as $ and %. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the information can also be expressed by the realization of base-128 numbers by adding 52 half-sized katakana characters and various symbols such as &ldquo;&minus;, *, /, &yen;, and &commat;&rdquo;. This can further shorten the information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Note that base-16, base-32, base-64, and base-128 numbers are used as examples, but the present invention is not limited to these methods. For example, any method such as base-50 or base-100 numbers capable of compressing information by using numbers, characters, and symbols can be applied to coding of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Also, the information coded as described above can also be expressed as follows as bar code type digital data other than characters and numbers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> &verbar;&squf;&squf;&squf;&squf;&squf;&verbar;&squf;&squf;&squf;&verbar;&squf;&squf;&squf;&verbar;&squf;&squf;&squf;&squf;&squf;&verbar;&squf;&verbar;&squf;&verbar;&verbar;&verbar;&squf;&squf;&squf;&verbar;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> &squf;&squf;&squf;&verbar;&verbar;&verbar;&verbar;&squf;&squf;&squf;&squf;&verbar;&squf;&squf;&verbar;&squf;&squf;&squf;&squf;&squf;&verbar;&squf;&squf;&verbar;&verbar;&squf;&squf;&verbar;&squf;&verbar;&squf;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> When the image information is constructed as this bar code type digital data, no OCR means for reading this image information is necessary, unlike in the case of character information. Since this simplifies the arrangement of the entire apparatus, the cost can be reduced. However, the code description length often increases. Accordingly, it is desirable to summarize and arrange the contents of description to prevent an excessively large output information amount. From this viewpoint, coded information using numbers and characters often shortens the overall description length and hence is suited to outputting a large amount of information by compressing it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The process of transferring information from a user to a service provider has been described above. By using output information from a user&apos;s image forming apparatus, the conditions of this apparatus can also be set (e.g., the conditions can be reset to initial values). When this is the case, the image forming apparatus is so configured that output information is read by a scanner, and an operation procedure necessary for the user is displayed on an operation panel. When information is to be printed out from the apparatus, the following document is added to the information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;To improve our maintenance service, read this coded information by a scanner, check the information appearing on your operation panel, and select an icon to be started. This optimizes the condition setting of the apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Please contact the following service station for further information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Service station 044-548-&plus;&plus;**&num;&num; Toshiba Copying Machine Service Provider 70, Yanagimachi, Saiwai-ku, Kawasaki City&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> When a user&apos;s image forming apparatus is not connected to a network, a printed-out sheet output from the image forming apparatus is sent by mail or manually sent by FAX transmission. On the other hand, an image forming apparatus sometimes has a FAX function and is connected as a FAX apparatus to a telephone line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> In this case, the coded information is automatically transmitted to the FAX number of a service provider previously set in the FAX function, without printing out the information from the image forming apparatus or waiting for operations by the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> If the service provider has an apparatus capable of receiving the information sent by FAX transmission and storing the information in the form of electronic data, the information is received and stored in a database at appropriate timings. If the service provider has no such apparatus, the received information is printed out and stored in the conventional manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Also, a user&apos;s image forming apparatus is in some instances connected to an external system across a LAN. In this case, the coded information is converted into a predetermined file format or packet format and automatically transferred periodically to a service station&apos;s computer address by using ftp (file-transport-protocol) or the like, without any user&apos;s operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> If data transfer fails, the operation is switched to a method for a standalone type image forming apparatus, and the coded information and documents I and II are printed out. The user is prompted to send the printed data to the service provider by mail or by manual FAX transmission. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The arrangements of a user&apos;s image forming apparatus and a service provider&apos;s apparatus for receiving information, when the user&apos;s image forming apparatus and a service provider&apos;s computer or the like are not connected by a network or the like, will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows the arrangement of the user&apos;s image forming apparatus. This image forming apparatus includes a copying machine, printer, or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> A central processing unit (to be referred to as a CPU hereinafter) <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> controls printing operation and the like of the whole apparatus. In this embodiment, the CPU <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> transfers information <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> for use in maintenance to a memory <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. This information <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> includes, e.g., apparatus setting information, status information (status log), error information concerning a paper jamming occurrence portion or the like, an operation log, a part exchange warning, and necessary maintenance messages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The memory <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is a rewritable memory such as a RAM (Random Access Memory) and is preferably a detachable storage. This memory <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> stores the information <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> given by the CPU <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> A capacity determination unit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> detects the use ratio of the memory <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. If stored information reaches a predetermined ratio (e.g., 90%) of the capacity allocated to storage, the capacity determination unit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> notifies the memory <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of this information and instructs the memory <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to output the stored information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> When thus instructed to output the stored information by the capacity determination unit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, or when the user instructs the memory <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to output the stored information by selecting an operation menu of the apparatus, the memory <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> outputs and transfers stored information <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to a compressing unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The compressing unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> compresses the output information <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> from the memory <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> into coded information <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> by using, e.g., base-32 notation (to be described later), and outputs this coded information <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to a printing unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> This printing unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> has a printing function normally installed in an image forming apparatus. The printing unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> prints out the coded information <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> onto a sheet of paper. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The information printed on the paper surface is a list of at least the apparatus identification number, error information, operation log information, and apparatus status information, in the form of a text code including numbers or alphabets. This information can also be bar code type digital data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Since the compressing unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> compresses the information, it is possible to reduce the number of printing sheets and the cost. Also, since the printed contents are coded, the contents are not interpreted by the third party. This can prevent a leakage of secrets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows the arrangement of the apparatus of the service provider which has received a printed sheet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The image information printed on the sheet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is given as it is sent by mail from the user to the service provider or transmitted by FAX transmission to the receiving (printing) apparatus of the service provider. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> An OCR unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> reads this image information printed on the sheet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and outputs it as character information <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> This character information <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is compressed as described above. An expanding unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> expands this compressed information to restore uncompressed information <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, thereby obtaining electronic data (file). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> A monitor <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> displays the output information <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> from the expanding unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> on the screen, or a printing unit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> prints out the information on a sheet <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. The information <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is also stored in a database <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and used in analysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> The above configuration is based on the assumption that the user&apos;s image forming apparatus and the service provider&apos;s computer or the like are not connected by a network or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> In some cases, however, a user&apos;s image forming apparatus has a FAX function, and a service provider&apos;s apparatus has a function capable of directly storing information transmitted by facsimile in the form of electronic data. When this is the case, the information <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> from the compressing unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is output to a FAX transmitter (not shown) without being transmitted to the printing unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The FAX transmitter automatically transmits given information <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> by facsimile without waiting for user&apos;s operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> On the service provider side, the information <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is received by a FAX receiver (not shown) without using the OCR unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and output to the expanding unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Processing after that is the same as the above-mentioned processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, a user&apos;s image forming apparatus is sometimes connected in series to a service provider&apos;s computer via a telephone line. In this case, the information <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> from the compressing unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is output to a transmitter (not shown) without being transmitted to the printing unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The transmitter automatically transmits given information <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> via the telephone line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> On the service provider side, the information <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is received by a receiver (not shown) without using the OCR unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and output to the expanding unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Processing after that is the same as the above-mentioned processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Detailed operation procedures according to this embodiment will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> (1) Setting Operation When Apparatus is Manufactured </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> In the manufacture of the image forming apparatus, a machine number and the like are set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, instep S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> a setting mode is activated. More specifically, a user turns on a power supply while pressing a designated numerical key. </paragraph>

Similarly, input of a service provider IP address setting code is displayed in step S<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and input of a service provider FAX number setting code is displayed in step S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The user is prompted to select one of them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> If the user selects input of the user machine number setting code, in step S<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> the flow advances to a machine number input mode. If the user selects input of the service provider IP address setting code, in step S<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> the flow advances to a service center IP address setting code input mode. If the user selects input of the service provider FAX number setting code, in step S<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> the flow advances to a service center FAX number setting code input mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> (2) Machine Number Setting Sequence </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> A sequence of inputting the machine number is as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, when the flow advances to the machine number input mode, in step S<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> a machine number setting mode is set and input is waited for. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, an input method select menu is displayed on the screen of the apparatus. Input methods include, e.g., a key input method and a method by which information on a paper surface is automatically read and input by an image reading scanner. Input can also be canceled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, key input is accepted. In step S<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, the selected input method is identified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, the flow advances to a sequence corresponding to the selected input method. If the input is canceled, the flow returns to the setting mode waiting state in step S<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> If the service provider IP address setting mode is selected, or if the service provider FAX number setting mode is selected, a setting sequence is performed following a similar procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> (3) Key Input Sequence </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> When the key input sequence is selected, the processing is performed by the following procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, in step S<highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> key input is waited for. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, a key that is input by the user is accepted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, the input number is displayed on the screen of the apparatus. In step S<highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, the key input is accepted. In step S<highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, the flow returns to the waiting state by reset. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, if an interrupt occurs, the interrupt processing is started. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, the input number is saved in the memory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> (3) Automatic Reading by Image Reading Scanner </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> When automatic reading by the image reading scanner is selected, the processing is performed by the following procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, in step S<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> automatic reading by the image reading scanner is waited for. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, &ldquo;start&rdquo; and &ldquo;cancel&rdquo; are displayed on the screen, and the user is prompted to select one of them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> If &ldquo;start&rdquo; is selected, in step S<highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> the user makes preparations necessary for reading by the scanner. More specifically, the user places an original which describes a number on an original table of the scanner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, reading operation is started. In step S<highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, an image is detected from the read information and stored as image data in the image memory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, whether the read information is a code matching a predetermined format is checked. If mismatch is found, in step S<highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> a warning is displayed on the screen of the apparatus. In step S<highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, the flow returns to the reading waiting state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> If the read information is a code matching the predetermined format, in step S<highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> the code is converted into electronic data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, the number is displayed on the screen of the apparatus. If there is no error in the displayed number, in step S<highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> the user presses a &ldquo;start&rdquo; button. In step S<highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, the flow returns to the waiting state by reset. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> If interrupt processing is requested in S<highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, the user presses the &ldquo;start&rdquo; button in step S<highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, the machine number of the apparatus is stored in the memory. This memory is used to store set values and adjusted values. For example, a RAM is used as the memory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> The procedures of sequentially selecting and inputting the machine number, center computer IP address, and FAX number have been explained. However, it is also possible to set a setting mode by which these pieces of information are simultaneously read and input by the scanner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> In the manufacturing stage, apparatuses for the same destination are usually collectively produced. Accordingly, when a mode like this is set, the machine number, IP address, and FAX number can be successively input, and the efficiency improves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> (4) Sequence of Outputting Apparatus Information Etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> A sequence of outputting information necessary for maintenance, e.g., apparatus information, is as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, in step S<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> printing of apparatus information and the like is waited for. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, a new job is input. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, the flow advances to a block for performing system control of the apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, the contents of the job are checked. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, operation log information is checked. This operation log information contains a printing mode selected from, e.g., forced black-and-white, color, and automatic selection, the number of copies, the type of selected sheet, a size change ratio, one-sided or two-sided, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, the operation log information is saved in the memory. As described earlier, this memory is desirably a detachable memory, e.g., a card type memory, so as to facilitate maintenance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, the job is activated. In step S<highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, the flow advances to a printing sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, the job is terminated. This termination includes forced termination caused by an error such as paper jamming. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, work log data is formed.

<paragraph id="P-0247" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0247&rsqb;</number> If the state of the user&apos;s image forming apparatus is bad, code data is externally sent to the user by any of electronic mail, facsimile, and mail of a printed-out sheet. In accordance with an attached explanation/request document addressed to the user, the user sets the sent image data on a scanner, reads change information by the scanner, and inputs the information to the image forming apparatus. Data written at the beginning of the input coded data triggers a set value writing sequence previously input to the image forming apparatus, thereby automatically starting a set value writing process. This sequence is substantially analogous to that described in item (3) above and shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0248" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0248&rsqb;</number> In this sequence, copy and set value writing processes and the like are displayed by, e.g., code numbers or icons in a selection menu on the control panel. When the user selects a set value writing process, the set value is rewritten by a value indicated by the supplied code information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0249" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0249&rsqb;</number> The above embodiments are merely examples. Therefore, these embodiments do not restrict the present invention and can be variously modified where necessary. For instance, operation log information, error information, apparatus status information, and the like are described as examples of information of the image forming apparatus. However, any information useful to improve the maintenance service can be applied to the present invention and sent to the service provider. </paragraph>
