<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention related to disk drive storage systems and more particularly to a storage system that uses servo track writing. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A typical disk drive storage system includes one or more magnetic disks which are mounted for co-rotation on a hub or spindle. A typical disk drive also includes a transducer supported by hydrodynamic bearing which files above each magnetic disk. The transducer and the hydraulic bearing are collectively referred to as a data head. A drive controller is used for controlling the disk drive based on commands received from a host system. The drive controller controls the disk drive to retrieve information from the magnetic disk and to store information on the magnetic disk. An electro mechananical actuator operates when a negative feedback, closed loop servo system moves the data head radically or linearly over the disk surface for track seek operation and holds the transducer directly above the desired track or cylinder on the disk surface for track following operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Information is typically stored in concentric tracks on the surface of the magnetic disk by providing a write signal to the data head to encode flux reversals on the surface of the magnetic disk representing data to be stored. In retrieving data from the disk, the drive controller controls the electro mechanical actuator so that the data head files above the desired track or cylinder on the magnetic disk, sensing the flux reversals on the magnetic disks and generating a read signal based on those flux reversals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In an embedded servo system, servo information or servo bursts is recorded on data tracks, which also contain stored data. The servo bursts are typically temporally spaced evenly about the circumference of each data track. Data is recorded on a data track between the servo bursts. In a dedicated servo-type system, an entire disk surface and a disk drive is dedicated to storing the servo information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> As the data head reads the servo information, the transducer produces a position signal which is decoded by the position demodulator and presented in digital form to a servo control processor. The servo control processor essentially compares actual radial position of the transducer over the disk (as indicated by the embedded servo burst) with the desired position and commands the actuator to move in order to minimize position error. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The servo information is written on the disk surfaces during the manufacturer of the disk drive module. Each disk drive module is mounted to a servo writer support assembly which precisely locates the disk surface relative to the reference or origin. Each disk drive module is mounted to a servo writer support assembly which precisely locates the disk surfaces relative to reference or origin. The servo writer support assembly supports a position sensor, such as an laser light interferometer, which detects the position of the actuator relative to the disk surface. The position sensor is electronically inserted within the disk drive is negative feed back, close loop servo system for providing position information to the servo system while the servo data is being written to the disk surfaces. The servo writer support assembly may include a clock writer transducer which writes a clock pattern into the disk surface which is used for temporarily spacing the servo data about the circumference of each track. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, to accomplish writing the servo data, the write heads must be switched very quickly. The servo writer may write one of many surfaces at one time. Additionally, the servo writer verifies by reading with read heads all the surface wedges have been in fact written. Thus, during this read operation, when it is determined that all the servo wedges or servo data has been written, it is necessary to switch very quickly between read heads. Additionally, the read head may be of differing head resistance. However, these read heads operate with differing maximum current or voltage levels and consequently it is necessary to adjust the voltage levels, to accommodate the differing head types to prevent the heads from being destroyed by voltage which exceed those maximum levels. As a consequence the time lost to change the voltage internally so that the heads are not destroyed greatly increases the head switching time. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention includes a constant bias current circuit, which reads information from a head and minimizes the switching while in the servo mode. The circuit of the present invention operates the read heads at a safe operation current which is less than the smallest maximum current among all of the read heads employed. The present invention provides a switching less than 500 nanoseconds and at times can reach 300 nanoseconds for use in the servo mode. </paragraph>

The disk drive system <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of stacked magnetic recording disks <highlight><bold>1112</bold></highlight> mounted to a spindle <highlight><bold>1114</bold></highlight>. The disks <highlight><bold>1112</bold></highlight> may be conventional particulate or thin film recording disk or, in other embodiments, they may be liquid-bearing disks. The spindle <highlight><bold>1114</bold></highlight> is attached to a spindle motor <highlight><bold>1116</bold></highlight>, which rotates the spindle <highlight><bold>1114</bold></highlight> and disks <highlight><bold>1112</bold></highlight>. A chassis <highlight><bold>1120</bold></highlight> is connected to the enclosure <highlight><bold>1110</bold></highlight>, providing stable mechanical support for the disk drive system. The spindle motor <highlight><bold>1116</bold></highlight> and the actuator shaft <highlight><bold>1130</bold></highlight> are attached to the chassis <highlight><bold>1120</bold></highlight>. A hub assembly <highlight><bold>1132</bold></highlight> rotates about the actuator shaft <highlight><bold>1130</bold></highlight> and supports a plurality of actuator arms <highlight><bold>1134</bold></highlight>. The stack of actuator arms <highlight><bold>1134</bold></highlight> is sometimes referred to as a &ldquo;comb.&rdquo; A rotary voice coil motor <highlight><bold>1140</bold></highlight> is attached to chassis <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and to a rear portion of the actuator arms <highlight><bold>1134</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> A controller unit <highlight><bold>1160</bold></highlight> provides overall control to the disk drive system <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>, including rotation control of the disks <highlight><bold>1112</bold></highlight> and position control of the heads <highlight><bold>1152</bold></highlight>. The controller unit <highlight><bold>1160</bold></highlight> typically includes (not shown) a central processing unit (CPU), a memory unit and other digital circuitry, although it should be apparent that these aspects could also be enabled as hardware logic by one skilled in the computer arts. Controller unit <highlight><bold>1160</bold></highlight> is connected to the actuator control/drive unit <highlight><bold>1166</bold></highlight>, which is in turn connected to the rotary voice coil motor <highlight><bold>1140</bold></highlight>.

The host system <highlight><bold>1180</bold></highlight> may send digital data to the controller unit <highlight><bold>1160</bold></highlight> to be stored on the disks, or it may request that digital data at a specified location be read from the disks <highlight><bold>1112</bold></highlight> and sent back to the host system <highlight><bold>1180</bold></highlight>. A read/write channel <highlight><bold>1190</bold></highlight> is coupled to receive and condition read and write signals generated by the controller unit <highlight><bold>1160</bold></highlight> and communicate them to an arm electronics (AE) unit shown generally at <highlight><bold>1192</bold></highlight> through a cut-away portion of the voice coil motor <highlight><bold>1140</bold></highlight>. The AE unit <highlight><bold>1192</bold></highlight> includes a printed circuit board <highlight><bold>1193</bold></highlight>, or a flexible carrier, mounted on the actuator arms <highlight><bold>1134</bold></highlight> or in close proximity thereto, and an AE module <highlight><bold>1194</bold></highlight> mounted on the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>1193</bold></highlight> or carrier that comprises circuitry preferably implemented in an integrated circuit (IC) chip including read drivers, write drivers, and associated control circuitry.

The magnitude of current I<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>is related to the magnitude of current I<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>. The third current path includes PFET <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, resistor <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, resistor <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and NPN transistor <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>.

The other end of resistor <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is connected to NPN transistor <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. The collector of transistor <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is connected to the other end of resistor <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The emitter of transistor <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is connected to ground, and the base of transistor <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is connected to the base of transistor <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. The resistors <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> form a voltage based on the current I<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>times the resistance of resistor <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> times the resistance of resistor <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. These voltages are used to form a voltage at terminals N<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. The voltage at N<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>is the voltage at the emitter of transistor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> minus V<highlight><subscript>BE</subscript></highlight>. The voltage at the emitter of transistor <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> is the voltage at terminal N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>minus V<highlight><subscript>BE</subscript></highlight>.

The resistor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is an indication of the MR head. The other end of resistor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> or the MR head is connected to transistor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The other end of resistor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is connected to the emitter of transistor <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>.

The resistor <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and resistor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> provide a constant current to MR head shown as resistor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. As discussed before, the voltage at terminal N<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>minus V<highlight><subscript>BE </subscript></highlight>is the voltage at the emitter of transistor <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, and the voltage at terminal N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is minus V<highlight><subscript>BE </subscript></highlight>is the voltage at the other end of resistor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The current through the MR head is the current through the resistors <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. This is equal to voltage across X<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and X<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>/R<highlight><subscript>104</subscript></highlight>&plus;R<highlight><subscript>106</subscript></highlight>&plus;R<highlight><subscript>102</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The plus input of differential amplifier <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is connected to capacitor <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>. The other end of capacitor <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> is connected through capacitor <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> to the terminal between resistor <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and resistor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> shown as MR head. The capacitor <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> has one end connected to the other end of resistor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and one end of resistor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The other end of capacitor <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> is connected to the negative input of differential amplifier <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In the prior art, capacitor <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> has to be discharged to zero volts in order to reduce the current across MR head illustrated by resistance <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to zero when switching between read heads to prevent the maximum current from being exceeded. This takes a long time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In contrast, the present invention, the voltage across capacitor <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is kept to a sufficiently low level such as a safe current or a safe level of currents that are below the read head current of the read head with the lowest maximum head current. The voltage on capacitor <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> or capacitors <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is determined to be a voltage level such that it is sufficiently low, not to cause over current stress on MR head illustrated by resistor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. This is a safe voltage. This current is set by the current I<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>through the second current path <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the current I<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is controlled by the current IDAC. The safe current is usable for servo mode, since each head does not have to operate at the maximum current. The head switch time is determined by the time the bias current of head ramp up, plus the time for the reader head output to settle to a steady state value with 10 milli-volts of base time. As a consequence of the present invention, it is not necessary to reduce the voltage across capacitor <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to zero and the current will not change. This eliminates the charging time for this capacitor. The present invention maintains capacitor <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> at a safe voltage or a safe level of voltages which will vary depending on the type of heads used. It is thus possible to switch the head very quickly in the servo mode. There is not requirement to operate the read head at full current or voltage. </paragraph>
