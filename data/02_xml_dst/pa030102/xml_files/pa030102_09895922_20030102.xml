<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD AND INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to the co-texturization of reinforcing fibers and thermoplastic fibers and the resulting composite product. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> It is common to include sound absorbing material in engine exhaust mufflers to dampen or attenuate the sound made by engine exhaust gases as they pass from the engine through the exhaust system to the atmosphere. One technological approach to this problem is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,569,471 to Ingemansson et al. The Ingemansson et al. patent describes a process and apparatus for feeding lengths of continuous glass fiber strands into a muffler outer shell. The apparatus includes a nozzle for expanding the fiber strands into a wool-like material before the fiber strands enter the outer shell. The nozzle disclosed in the Ingemansson et al. patent is capable of expanding strand material to a density of about 70 grams/liter or more. While such material is useful for its intended purpose, it has also been found that lower density materials of between about 30 grams/liter to about 60 grams/liter are desirable for many sound and thermal insulation applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,766,541 to Knutsson et al. discloses methods and apparatus for making preforms from continuous glass fiber strand material and binder material. Such preforms may be produced at a central location in order to reduce equipment costs and then the preforms may be shipped to other locations where they may be combined with muffler shells during subsequent assembly operations. The method disclosed in the Knutsson et al. patent comprises the steps of: (a) feeding continuous glass fiber strand material into a perforated mold to form a wool product in the mold; (b) feeding a binder in powdered form into the mold; (c) curing the binder to bond together portions of the strand material forming the compacted wool product such that a preform is formed having generally the shape of the mold; (d) opening the mold; and (e) removing the preform from the mold. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,976,453 to Nilsson et al. discloses a device and process for expanding strand material to densities as low as 30 grams/liter. Specifically, glass fiber roving is passed through a texturizing gun at feeding speeds of up to 400 meters/minute to 600 meters/minute simultaneously with pressurized gas at pressures up to 7.0 bars in order to produce a wool-like product suitable for use as acoustic and/or thermal insulation in automotive and industrial applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a new method or process for producing a wool-type material of relatively low density including densities below 30 grams/liter which exhibit beneficial acoustic and/or thermal insulating properties suited for a multitude of automotive and industrial applications. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method of co-texturizing reinforcing fibers and thermoplastic fibers. The method comprises the steps of passing a continuous reinforcing fiber strand or roving through a texturizing gun, simultaneously passing a thermoplastic fiber strand or roving through the texturizing gun with the reinforcing fiber strand and injecting pressurized air into the texturizing gun concurrently with the reinforcing fiber and thermoplastic fiber strands. This method produces a co-texturized, composite wool-type product having densities ranging from about 20-200 grams/liter, preferably from about 20 grams/liter to less than about 30 grams/liter, and exhibiting beneficial acoustical and/or thermal insulating properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The reinforcing fiber strand may, for example, be any commercially available continuous glass fiber strand made from E-glass or S-glass fibers or a carbon fiber strand that is resistant to high levels of heat. The continuous thermoplastic fiber strand may be made from any appropriate thermoplastic fiber material known in the art including but not limited to polypropylene, polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, nylon and any mixtures thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The reinforcing fiber strand and the thermoplastic fiber strand are passed or fed through the texturizing gun at a rate of between approximately 300-600 meters/minutes and more typically about 400 meters/minute. The pressurized air may be injected into the texturizing gun at pressures ranging from about 1.0-7.0 bars and more typically about 3.0 bars. Still further, the reinforcing fiber strand and thermoplastic fiber strand may be passed through the texturizing gun in amounts so as to produce a co-texturized composite product of from about 1 to 99% and more typically from about 20 to about 85% by weight reinforcing fiber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The co-texturized product may, for example, be blown from the texturizing gun directly into an assembled product or into a mold. In the alternative, the method may include the step of placing the co-texturized reinforcing and thermoplastic fiber material discharged from the texturizing gun into a bag. Typically, the bag is constructed from a thermoplastic material such as but not limited to polypropylene, polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, nylon and any mixtures thereof The bag and the co-texturized reinforcing and thermoplastic fiber contents thereof may then be subsequently used as a load for a molding machine and molded under heat and pressure into a desired shape for any appropriate application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In accordance with yet another aspect of the present invention, a cotexturized fiber material is provided. That co-texturized fiber material comprises between 1-99% by weight reinforcing fiber material and 1-99% by weight thermoplastic fiber material and more typically between about 20-85% by weight reinforcing fiber material and 15-80% by weight thermoplastic fiber material. The co-texturized material has an overall density of from about 20 grams/liter to about 200 grams/liter and preferably from about 20 grams/liter to less than about 30 grams/liter. The continuous reinforcing fiber material may be selected from a group consisting of glass fibers (e.g. E-glass fibers, S-glass fibers), carbon fibers and any mixtures thereof. The thermoplastic fibers may be selected from a group of materials consisting of polypropylene, polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, nylon and any mixtures thereof. It should be appreciated, however, that the specific continuous reinforcing fibers and thermoplastic fiber materials listed are only being presented for purposes of illustration and are not to be considered as restrictive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Still other benefits and advantages of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in this art from the following description wherein there is shown and described a preferred embodiment of this invention, simply by way of illustration of one of the modes best suited to carry out the invention. As it will be realized, the invention is capable of other different embodiments and its several details are capable of modification in various, obvious aspects all without departing from the invention. Accordingly, the drawing and descriptions will be regarded as illustrative in nature and not as restrictive.</paragraph>

<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Reference will now be made in detail to the present preferred embodiment of the invention, an example of which is illustrated in the accompanying drawing. </paragraph>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Reference is now made to the FIGURE schematically showing the method of the present invention for co-texturizing continuous reinforcing fibers and thermoplastic fibers. Specifically, a strand feeder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprising one or more strand feeding mechanisms feed at least one continuous reinforcing fiber strand <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> from a spool source <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and one or more continuous thermoplastic fiber strands <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> from one or more spool sources <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to a texturizing gun <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Such a strand feeder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may simply feed a metered amount or quantity of each strand <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to the texturizing gun <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the strand feeder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may both feed a metered amount or quantity of each strand <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and also complete some texturizing of one or more of the strands by separating the individual fibers. Examples of strand feeders <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> known in the art include the feeding mechanism shown and described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,569,471 to Ingemansson et al. (the full disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference) and the commercially available SILENTEX machine. The texturizing gun <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is of a type well known in the art such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,976,453 to Nilsson et al. or U.S. Pat. No. 5,766,541 to Knutsson et al. The full disclosure of these two patents is also incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The continuous reinforcing fiber strand <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may, for example, be any commercially available carbon fiber strand formed from a plurality of carbon fibers or glass fiber strand formed from a plurality of glass fibers. An example of such a strand is a commercially available roving. Such a roving will typically have a density of between about 0.5-2.0 grams/yard. Glass fiber strands are preferred for many applications such as muffler filler material as glass fibers are resistant to the high levels of heat produced in the interior of an engine exhaust muffler. The strands may be formed from continuous E-glass or S-glass fibers. Still, it is also contemplated that the strand material may be formed from other continuous reinforcing fibers which, preferably, are resistant to heat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The thermoplastic fiber strand or strands <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are formed from a plurality of thermoplastic fibers. Again, an example of such a strand is a commercially available thermoplastic roving. Such a roving will typically have a density of between about 0.2-1.5 grams/yard. The thermoplastic fiber material may be selected from a group consisting of polypropylene, polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, nylon and any mixtures thereof. It is further contemplated that the strand material may be formed from other thermoplastic fibers suited to the particular application in question. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The strand feeder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and texturizing gun <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> function together to pass a selected amount or quantity of reinforcing fiber strand <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and thermoplastic fiber strand <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> through the texturizing gun <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> so as to produce a co-texturized composite product <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> comprising between about 199% by weight reinforcing fiber and 1-99% by weight thermoplastic fiber and more typically 20-85% by weight reinforcing fiber and 15-80% by weight thermoplastic fiber. The co-texturized composite product typically has an overall density of from about 20 grams/liter to about 200 grams/liter and preferably from about 20 grams/liter to less than about 30 grams/liter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> More particularly describing the invention, the reinforcing fiber strand <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and thermoplastic fiber strands <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are passed through the texturizing gun simultaneously at a rate of approximately 300-600 meters/minute. Simultaneously, pressurized air from a pressurized air source <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is injected into the texturizing gun <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> at a pressure of about 1.0-7.0 bars and typically about 3.0 bars. Together, the strand feeder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the pressurized air in the texturizing gun <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> draw the appropriate amount or quantity of reinforcing fiber strand <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> from the spool <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and thermoplastic fiber strands <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> from the spools <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to produce the desired product. As the strands <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> pass through the texturizing gun <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> the strand material is expanded and fluffed into a wool-like product. Specifically, the reinforcing fiber and thermoplastic fiber strands <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are co-texturized with good reinforcing fiber dispersion in the thermoplastic fibers. Accordingly, the thermoplastic fibers act as a matrix resin and the glass or carbon fibers function as a reinforcement. The resulting composite product exhibits a number of beneficial strength and molding properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> As shown in the FIGURE, the resulting composite product <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be delivered directly into a cavity of a final product (e.g. a muffler shell), or directly into a mold for heat and/or pressure molding into a desired shape. For example, the co-texturized composite product <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be molded into a preform for a muffler. For such an application, the composite product <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> typically comprises about 95-99% by weight glass fiber and about 1-5% thermoplastic fiber. The thermoplastic fiber acts as a binder to hold the glass fibers in the desired shape for subsequent installation of the preform into the shell of a muffler. After the finished muffler is installed on a vehicle, hot exhaust gases generated by the engine of the vehicle drive off the remaining thermoplastic fiber binder leaving the glass fiber to expand, fill the muffler shell and provide the desired noise attenuation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In yet another alternative, the composite material <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is placed into a bag <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> which may be formed from a thermoplastic material such as polypropylene, polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, nylon and mixtures thereof. The bag <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> with its composite product <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> held therein may be subsequently used as a load for a molding machine and molded under heat and/or pressure into the desired shape for any appropriate application including as a filler material in a muffler. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The following example is presented to further illustrate the invention but it is not to be considered as limited thereto. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 1 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> A sample of glass roving, 1.13 grams/yard (coated with a polypropylene compatible size) and with a tex of 1235, about 2000 filaments and about 16 micron filament diameter was co-texturized with three tows of polypropylene fiber (each tow was 0.53 gram/yard). The ratio of glass to polypropylene was 1.13/1.59&equals;0.71. The percent glass content of the texturized material was 1.13/2.72&times;100 or 42%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Some of this texturized material was placed on a &frac18;&Prime; thick steel plate with a 6&Prime;&times;6&Prime; square hole. The steel plate and texturized material were placed in a hot press and molded. The mold temperature was approximately 400&deg; F. and pressure was estimated to be 300 psi and molding time was estimated to be ten minutes. The molded part was cooled and removed from the plate and a 42% glass/polypropylene laminate was produced weighing 103 grams. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The foregoing description of the preferred embodiment of the invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed. Obvious modifications or variations are possible in light of the above teachings. For example, while the invention as illustrated shows the passing of the thermoplastic fiber strands <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> through the strand feeder or SILENTEX machine, the thermoplastic fiber strand may be fed in metered quantity directly into the texturizing gun without undergoing any pretexturization. Still further, rather than processing separate reinforcing fiber and glass fiber strands, one or more strands of commingled reinforcing fibers and thermoplastic fibers may be co-texturized in accordance with the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The embodiment was chosen and described to provide the best illustration of the principles of the invention and its practical application to thereby enable one of ordinary skill in the art to utilize the invention in various embodiments and with various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated. All such modifications and variations are within the scope of the invention as determined by the appended claims when interpreted in accordance with the breadth to which they are fairly, legally and equitably entitled. </paragraph>
