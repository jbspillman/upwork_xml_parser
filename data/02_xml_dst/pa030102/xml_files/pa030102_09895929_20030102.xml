<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention pertains to the field of underground sprinkling systems. More particularly, the present invention pertains to underground sprinkler systems operating using a pump. Even more particularly, the present invention pertains to underground sprinkler systems operated using a non-priming submersible pump with housing. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Persons living on a body of water often utilize the water as a source for sprinkling lawns and/or gardens to avoid having to pay water utility charges to maintain their horticulture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Generally to implement such a watering system a pump is used to draw water from a source and pump it through a network of underground pipes to be dispensed through sprinkler heads. The pump generally utilized is a centrifugal type pump that requires &ldquo;priming&rdquo; before it can be operated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Priming the pump involves drawing water through a feed pipe into the pump, until all of the air is removed from the feed pipe and the cavity of the pump. Running the pump when there is air within the system can cause damage to the pump as well as to the sprinkling system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Generally the pump must be primed before each use, as the system usually drains when not running. It is undesirable to have to prime a pump each time one wishes to utilize the sprinkling system. It is also undesirable to have to wait until the underground network of pipes becomes filled with water, before operating the system under full operating pressure to avoid damage to the sprinkling heads. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A multitude of submersible pumps with housings have been disclosed to the public as water pumping means, including those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,205,725 (A Top Suction Pump Including a Pump Housing) and U.S. Pat. No. 4,693,271 (A Horizontally Mounted Submersible Pump Assembly). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Neither of the reference patents teaches a pump and housing assembly suitable for use in a sprinkling system utilizing a non-municipal water source such as a lake or other such water source. Specifically, U.S. Pat. No. 5,205,725 teaches a pump and housing assembly for use in a sump. The vertical orientation of the pump is not suitable in a lake environment, due to the possibility of clogging due to weeds and other debris commonly found in such an environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,693,271 teaches a horizontally mounted pump assembly for pumping water from water storage tanks. Again, the pump assembly would not be suitable for use in a lake environment, because it has no design features to avoid clogging by debris, and is specifically designed for use for transferring water from storage tanks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It is therefore, the purpose of the present invention to cure those deficiencies outlined above by providing a non-priming submersible pump assembly suitable for use in a lake environment to provide water for a sprinkling system. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In a first aspect of the present invention, there is disclosed an electrical non-priming submersible pump that includes a motor assembly that has a motor coupled to a shaft. The shaft has impellers associated therewith for propelling water. There is also included a housing assembly that surrounds the motor assembly. The housing assembly has an intake area that includes a multi-layer sediment protection system that prevents the introduction of debris into the housing as well as prevents the build-up of sediment on the exterior of the housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In a second aspect of the invention, there is disclosed a sprinkling system that includes an electrical non priming submersible pump, a control panel in communication with the pump to regulate liquid flow, a first means for connecting the pump to the control panel, a header pipe section, a second means for connecting the control panel to the header pipe section, at least one zone pipe section connected to the header pipe section, and at least one sprinkler head interposed within the at least one zone pipe section to supply water to a desired location.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 7</cross-reference>, there is a shown a preferred embodiment of a pump, denoted at <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, used in the invention. The pump <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> includes a motor assembly <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, and a housing assembly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The motor assembly <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> includes a first bearing assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> located at the rear of the motor assembly <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and in communication with a motor shaft <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The motor shaft <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, in a preferred embodiment, is made of stainless steel, but substitution of a suitable non-corrodible material can alternatively be used by the present invention. The motor shaft <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is linked with an electric motor <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, to apply rotational force to the motor shaft <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. In a preferred embodiment, the electric motor <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is of the 110-volt variety, capable of running on standard house current within the United States. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A motor <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> utilizing another current, such as a 220-volt variety can alternatively be used by the present invention. The motor <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is encased in a watertight motor housing <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> to protect the electric motor from exposure to water. Within the motor housing <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> there is provided a coupling <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which allows for the passage of a shielded electric supply cable <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> to connect with the electric motor <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to provide a source of electric power for the motor <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The coupling <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> allows for the passage of the cable while maintaining a watertight seal to prevent intrusion of liquid into the motor housing <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. At another end of the shielded electric supply cable <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> there is provided a GFI switch (not shown) to protect against electrocution. The GFI switch is also in communication with a source of power. GFI switches are known in the art to provide protection from electrical shock when an electric system is used in the proximity of water. The GFI switch cuts power to the electrical unit should there be a short circuit due to exposure to water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The motor shaft <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> further extends from the motor <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> through the motor housing <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and is in communication with a second bearing assembly <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> There is provided a motor intake screen <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> positioned between the motor unit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and the impeller unit <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> of the motor assembly <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The screen provides a barrier to filter debris and to prevent entry of debris into the impeller unit <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. The motor shaft <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> further extends from the second bearing assembly <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> through the intake screen <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and projects into the impeller unit <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. In a preferred embodiment, there are provided <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> impeller blades <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> that are permanently affixed along the motor shaft <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> at uniform intervals. It is to be appreciated that a different number of impeller blades can alternatively be utilized by the present invention. Each impeller blade <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> has a pair of cerated fins <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> affixed to the blade at a uniform diameter from the center of the blade. The cerated fins <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> are biased at an angle relative to the impeller blade to propel water in a direction toward the threaded opening <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of the pump <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Each impeller blade <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> has a pair of cerated fins <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> that are placed at a different diameter on the blade <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> relative to each of the other impeller blades <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. This alignment provides for a more proficient propulsion of the water as the fins <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> cover a greater cross section within the impeller unit <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The shaft <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> further extends toward the threaded opening of the pump <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and is in communication with a third bearing assembly <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As previously recited, there is provided a threaded opening <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to allow for passage of water from the impeller unit <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> into a feed shaft <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> that is threadably engaged with the threaded opening <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. There is provided within the feed shaft <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> a check valve assembly <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> to prevent backflow of water when the pump <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is not in operation. There is also provided a coupling union <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> for securely engaging a feed line <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> to deliver water to a desired location. </paragraph>

The mounting bracket <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is substantially cross-shaped and engages the motor housing <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> at 4 points to provide support. The mounting bracket <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> further engages the inside wall <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> of the main body section <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> to prevent movement of the motor assembly <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> within the housing assembly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The mounting bracket <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is designed to accommodate various sized motor assemblies <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> within the housing assembly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The other end of the motor assembly <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is maintained in a central position within the housing assembly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> by the feed shaft <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> there is provided within the second end cap <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> a centrally located hole <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> of a diameter to allow passage of the feed shaft <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> there through. The feed shaft <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> engages the second end cap <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> through the hole <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> to support the motor assembly <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in a central position. There is also provided within the second end cap <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> a hold and coupling <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> to allow for entry of the shielded electrical supply cable <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> to the motor assembly <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, there are multiple whole and couplings <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> to facilitate the various arrangements for entry of the shielded electrical supply cable <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. Also shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, are a plurality of access ports <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> having threaded fasteners removably attached to allow for entry of various articles into the housing <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 7</cross-reference>, there is provided an intake area <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> positioned near a rear portion of the housing assembly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>.
