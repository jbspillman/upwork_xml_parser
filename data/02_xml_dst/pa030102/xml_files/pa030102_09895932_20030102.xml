<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 1. Technical Field </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates in general to electronic commerce and, in particular, to facilitating personalized designs where utilizing both remote and local manufacturers may be advantageous. Still more particularly, the present invention relates to brokering a personalized design among remote and local manufacturers such that a customer obtains a locally assembled, cost effective product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In recent years, with the development of computer network technology, an electronic commerce (e-commerce) system has developed in which consumers and vendors are connected via a network. Electronic commerce can occur between a consumer and a vendor through, for example, an online information service, the Internet, a bulletin board system (BBS) or electronic data interchange (EDI). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> There are many different methods in which e-commerce may be implemented as there are a vast variety of commodities and services in need of being traded. Many e-commerce systems operate on a post and match process; that is, the systems work by having a prospective consumer bid on an item and if the bid matches the vendors&apos;s specified selling price, the item is sold to that consumer. In another example, many e-commerce systems involve on-line auctions where vendors place products or services up for bid and consumers electronically place bids for purchasing the products or services; the item is sold to the consumer with the highest bid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Other e-commerce systems allow users to view a graphical rendering of products as the user selects from multiple options that change the appearance of the product utilizing software tools such as Shockwave&trade;. For example, a graphical rendering of a shirt may be provided where the color of the shirt in the graphical rendering changes according to a color selected by the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The present e-commerce systems are limited in that some products are more advantageous to receive from a local manufacturer, however the user is typically ordering a product from a remote manufacturer, where the remote manufacturer ships the product via mail service. Moreover, where a user can order a product that is available for local delivery, the user is not provided with multiple bids for the product including local and remote manufacturer bids for the product. For example, where a user is purchasing a piece of jewelry or a perishable good, assembly of the jewelry or perishable good by a local jeweler or bakery may be preferable to receiving the piece of jewelry or perishable good via shipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Therefore, in view of the foregoing, it would be advantageous to provide a method, system and program for facilitating the personalized design of products where utilization of both local and remote manufacturers is advantageous. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>

<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the present invention to provide a method, system and program for facilitating personalized designs where utilizing both remote and local manufacturers may be advantageous. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a method, system and program for brokering a personalized design among remote and local manufacturers such that a customer obtains a locally assembled, cost effective product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> According to one aspect of the present invention, a manufacturing order from a user is divided into multiple manufacturable parts. Next, a local bid request for the manufacturing order is submitted to multiple local manufacturers. In response to receiving multiple local bids for the manufacturing order, a remote bid request is submitted to multiple remote manufacturers for bidding on a selection of the manufacturable parts as requested in the local bids. The user is then enabled to select from the bid options provided by local and remote manufacturers. </paragraph>
