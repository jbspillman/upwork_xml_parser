<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A membrane switch circuit layout and method for producing a membrane switch circuit layout are disclosed. The membrane switch circuit layout may have two or more membrane layers. Each membrane has a top surface and a bottom surface. A conductive circuit trace is printed on the top surface of each membrane. The membrane layers are placed in a stack with each top membrane having thru-holes selectively cut there through. Thus, for example, in a layout having two membrane layers, the first membrane is positioned beneath the second membrane and the second membrane has thru-holes cut there through. Conductive ink may be pressed through the thru-holes to provide electrical connection between the circuit traces printed on the membrane layers. An adhesive may be placed between the membrane layers as either adhesive printed on one of the membrane layers or as an additional layer. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to membrane switch circuit layouts and the method of manufacturing such. Specifically, it relates to membrane switch circuit layouts having multiple insulated membrane layers each having electrical circuit paths printed thereon. The invention provides electrical connection is desired at discrete positions between the circuit paths on different membrane layers. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The manufacture of membrane switch circuit layouts having thru-holes is presently performed with a screen-printing process. One method of screen-printing generally provides printing a membrane with an electrical circuit path on both its top and bottom surface. Thru-holes are selectively cut through the membrane where electrical connection is desired between the circuit path printed on the top surface and the circuit path printed on the bottom surface. Normally, the membrane is then placed with its bottom surface on a blotting paper or support paper. Conductive ink is pressed through the thru-holes from the top surface to the bottom surface. If a blotting or support paper is not used, excess ink must be wiped from the surface beneath the membrane. If a blotting or support paper is used, the paper must be replaced before the next step. The membrane is then turned over and placed with its top surface on a blotting or support paper. Conductive ink is pressed through the thru-holes from the bottom surface to the top surface to ensure complete filling of the holes. If a blotting or support paper is not used, excess ink must again be wiped from the surface beneath the membrane. This process is labor intensive and costly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> An additional concern with the current printing process is that the excess ink may spread out along the bottom or top surface of the membrane once the ink is pressed through the thru-hole. This causes a sloppy connection and may spread over multiple paths of the circuit trace on the bottom surface. In such a case, the entire membrane switch circuit must be reproduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Another problem with this process method for membrane switch circuit layouts is that the electrical connection between the circuits paths on the various surfaces may deteriorate. Deterioration results because there is no support of the conductive ink filled hole. Bending, pressure, or normal wear may result in the ink flaking from the hole and deteriorating the electrical connection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Alternately, membrane switch circuit layouts may be printed using a dielectric or insulating layer between layers of circuit traces printed on one side of a membrane. That method involves printing a first conductive trace on a surface of the membrane; selectively printing a dielectric or insulating layer, a non-conductive ink, over the first conductive trace, leaving open areas where electrical conduction is desired between conductive traces; and printing a second conductive trace over the dielectric or insulating layer. Printing of the dielectric or insulating layer requires two printing passes to ensure no &ldquo;pinhole&rdquo; gaps. Any pinhole in the dielectric or insulating layer may result in a shorted circuit. Further, under high humidity conditions, the dielectric or insulating layer absorbs moisture that provides an undesirable path for silver migration through the dielectric or insulating layer. Silver migration results in a high resistance short in the circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Due, at least, to the two printing passes, this method is labor and cost intensive. The resulting membrane switch circuit similarly suffers from possible degradation of the traces. In particular, there is concern that the dielectric or insulating layer will deteriorate through bending, pressure, or normal wear. This would cause open communication between the two traces. It is similarly possible that the second conductive trace would deteriorate and cause a lack of electrical conductivity along the path desired. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> To address the difficulties noted above, it is an object of this invention to provide a membrane switch circuit layout without the shortcomings of those in the current art and a more cost-effective method for manufacturing membrane switch circuit layouts. While reference is made explicitly to two membrane circuit layers, it should be apparent to those skilled in the art that the circuit may be manufactured of any number of membrane layers. The membrane switch circuit layout and method for producing such of the current invention eliminates the shortcomings of the prior art and provides a cost-effect method for producing the membrane switch circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention, the membrane switch circuit comprises two membrane layers, a first membrane layer and second membrane layer. Each membrane layer is printed with a circuit trace. The second membrane layer has thru-holes selectively cut there through to provide electrical connection between the circuit trace on the first membrane layer and the circuit trace on the second membrane layer at discrete points. The second membrane layer is positioned over the first membrane layer and conductive ink is pressed through the thru-holes. Pads may be printed on the first membrane layer for receiving the conductive ink. Gravity forces the ink through the hole to contact the bottom layer. The spread of the ink is constrained to the size of the hole and there is little risk of the ink spreading along the bottom layer as it is blocked by the contact of the two membrane layers with one another. A viscous ink is preferred to enable the ink to completely fill the hole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The first membrane layer, positioned beneath the second membrane layer, may provide support for the conductive ink. This prevents the need for use of blotting or support paper during the printing process. It decreases the printing process from two steps to one step as the hole is completely filled in one step rather than requiring flipping of the membrane layer and filling from the opposite surface. Additionally, the support provided by the first membrane layer demonstrably decreases the deterioration of the electrical connection between circuit paths provided by the conductive ink. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The second membrane layer additionally provides insulation between the conductive traces at all locations other than those where thru-holes have been selectively cut. This eliminates the necessity of an additional insulating layer for use when intersecting traces (e.g., crossovers) are not intended to be inter-conductive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The invention may be further understood from the following more detailed description taken with the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> It will be understood that the drawings are intended to teach a preferred embodiment of the present invention but are not intended to limit the invention thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, there is depicted a side view a membrane switch circuit layout. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> particularly shows an exploded view of the layers of the membrane switch circuit layout. First and second membrane layers <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> respectively comprise the main structure of the circuit. The membrane layers <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are 0.001-0.007 inches thick in a preferred embodiment. However, any thickness suitable to support conductive ink traces and provide insulation and/or thru-holes there between may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The first membrane layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is the support layer for the circuit. A circuit path <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is printed on the first membrane layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The circuit path may be printed with suitable conductive ink as is known in the art. An adhesive <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is positioned over first membrane layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. As shown in this embodiment, the adhesive <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be an adhesive layer selectively cut for openings. The adhesive <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be a pressure sensitive adhesive or heat sensitive adhesive applied to the bottom surface of the second membrane layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or the top surface of the first membrane layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and selectively cut for openings. The adhesive <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may alternatively be a printable adhesive selectively printed for openings on the top surface of the first membrane layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or the bottom surface of the second membrane layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> A circuit path <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is printed on the second membrane layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The second membrane layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is selectively cut with thru-holes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to allow electrical connection between the first membrane circuit path <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the second membrane circuit path <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The thru-holes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are intended to provide electrical connection between the first and second membrane circuit paths <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> only at selected discrete locations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The first membrane circuit path traces at other locations, for example <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, are insulated from second membrane circuit path traces, for example <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The second membrane layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> insulates the first membrane circuit path traces <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> from the second membrane circuit path traces, for example <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The thru-hole <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is press filled with conductive ink <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to complete the electrical connection. Although conductive ink is particularly preferred, any other electrically conductive medium may be used to fill the thru-hole <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a top perspective view of a preferred embodiment of the membrane switch circuit layout. First and second membrane circuit paths, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> respectively, are electrically connected at the location of thru-hole <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. A pad <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> for receiving conductive ink is printed on first membrane <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> corresponding to the location of the thru-hole <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in second membrane <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. First membrane circuit path traces <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are insulated from second membrane circuit path traces <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> by second membrane <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A particular embodiment of the present membrane switch circuit layout may be manufactured as follows. The top surface of first membrane <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is printed with a conductive circuit trace <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. An adhesive is positioned between first and second membrane layers, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> respectively. The adhesive <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be a pressure sensitive adhesive or heat sensitive adhesive applied to the bottom surface of the second membrane layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or the top surface of the first membrane layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and selectively cut for openings. The adhesive <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may alternatively be a printable adhesive selectively printed for openings on the top surface of the first membrane layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or the bottom surface of the second membrane layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The second membrane <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having thru-holes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> selectively cut there through and located to connect the first membrane circuit trace <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with a second membrane circuit trace <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, is positioned over the first membrane layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The top surface of second membrane layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is printed with the conductive circuit trace <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the thru-holes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are press-filled with conductive ink. This completes the electrical connection of the first membrane circuit trace <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the second membrane circuit trace <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> As should be obvious to one skilled in the art, it is possible to use the same method of positioning multiple membrane layers over one another with thru-holes through top membrane layers providing electrical connection between different circuit paths to manufacture a membrane switch circuit layout comprising more than two membrane layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> While particular embodiments in accordance with the present invention have been shown and described, it is understood that the invention is not limited thereto, and is susceptible to numerous changes and modifications as known to those skilled in the art. Therefore, this invention is not limited to the details shown and described herein, and includes all such changes and modifications as encompassed by the scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
