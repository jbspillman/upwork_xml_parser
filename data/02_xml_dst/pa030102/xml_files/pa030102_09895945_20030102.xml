<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an apparatus and method for screening two or more samples under controlled environmental conditions. More particularly, the present invention relates to an apparatus and method for permitting the screening of two or more material samples under controlled temperature and pressure, wherein one or more chemical components may be injected in-situ into the screening apparatus at ambient conditions or under pressure at any point during the screening. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Homogeneous catalysis plays an important role in the discovery of new materials such as polymers from the polymerization or copolymerization of olefins and often involves the use of organometallic catalysts. Typically, the active organometallic catalyst is generated by treatment of a catalyst precursor with a chemical component such as a suitable activator and/or scavenger. For olefin polymerization it is often preferable to generate the active catalyst in the presence of at least one of the olefinic monomers to be polymerized and under conditions where the concentrations and ratios of the monomers being polymerized are carefully controlled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This is partly because some catalysts will decompose more readily in the absence of the monomer(s) to be polymerized (they are, in effect, stabilized by the presence of the monomers). It is also often important to generate active catalysts in the presence of all the monomers being polymerized and under conditions where the monomer concentrations and ratios are carefully controlled because the composition, structure or properties of the polymer being produced may be adversely affected otherwise. This may be challenging for gaseous monomers such as ethylene, propylene and isobutylene where the generation of an active catalyst is generally preferably done under pressure equilibrated conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The application of combinatorial methodologies to the discovery of new materials such as polymers continues to receive considerable attention in academia and industry because it has the potential to increase greatly the rate of discovery over conventional discovery methods. U.S. Pat. No. 6,030,917, incorporated herein by reference, owned by the Assignee of the present application and entitled Combinatorial Synthesis and Analysis of Organometallic Compounds and Catalysts, issued February 2000 to Weinberg et al., discusses general combinatorial methods for preparing organometallic compounds such as catalysts. And PCT Application No. PCT/US00/00418, incorporated herein by reference, published July 2000 and owned by the Assignee of the present invention, discusses library formats for ligand arrays that may be used in the application of combinatorial methodologies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A typical workflow that utilizes combinatorial methodologies for the discovery of new catalysts such as homogeneous catalysts that may polymerize olefinic monomers involves the screening large arrays of potential catalysts for their activity. The most active catalysts may be later screened under more carefully controlled conditions to ascertain polymer properties, composition or structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> One such method for simultaneously determining the activity of large libraries of catalysts involves the use of infrared thermography (&ldquo;IRT&rdquo;) where a digital infrared camera is used to image (e.g., digitally photograph) the library of catalysts in the presence of one or more polymerizable monomers. Active catalysts are easily discerned from less active or inactive ones by comparing integrated temperature changes produced over time for each catalyst. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,063,633 to Wilson, entitled &ldquo;Catalyst Testing Process and Apparatus,&rdquo; incorporated herein by reference, discussing a method and apparatus of testing a plurality of catalyst formations to determine the comparative catalytic activity of the formations in the presence of a given reactant or reactant mixture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In a typical experiment using IRT, an array of potential catalyst precursors in a standard 96-well microtiter plate may be treated with the desired amounts of one or more polymerizable monomers, activators, scavengers or other agents that may generate or stabilize an active catalyst, and the activity of the catalysts in the array is then monitored. For experiments that involve the use of gaseous monomers such as ethylene, propylene, or isobutylene, an array of catalyst precursors is typically first treated (if necessary) with liquid co-monomers and then pressurized in a high pressure reaction chamber for a length of time suitable to allow dissolution of the gaseous monomer(s) into the individual solutions of the catalysts precursors. The reaction chamber is then typically depressurized, to allow for and activators and/or scavengers to be added to the reaction chamber. The library is returned to the reaction chamber, and the reaction chamber repressurized with the gaseous monomer to run the reaction of interest. Catalyst activity is then monitored by IRT through an infrared (&ldquo;IR&rdquo;) transparent window mounted to the reaction chamber so as to be situated above the library and in optical contact with an infrared camera (&ldquo;IR camera&rdquo;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> This process has been successfully used to identify active catalysts in a single 96-element array format but may be problematic in several respects. For example, the step of pressurizing the array just prior to commencing data acquisition with gaseous monomers such as ethylene may introduce unwanted thermal signatures in the data being collected. This is because during pressurization the heat of compression of the gas causes a slight increase in the local temperature of the reaction chamber and therefore the catalyst solutions in the array. When the gas has reached a final pressure and there are no pressure-volume changes or other adjustments experienced by the system, the wells in the library begin to cool down towards ambient temperature. This cooling exotherm is then superposed over exotherms generated in the system due to catalyst activity in the wells and has to be subtracted from the data gathered in order to accurately extract the heat produced by these catalytic events. This can be particularly problematic for monitoring catalysts that are not very active or where the cooling exotherm is of the same or greater scale than that of the exotherms generated due to catalysis. The cooling exotherm may also interfere with efforts to obtain reliable data early in an experiment or for catalysts that are most active early on where the thermal noise due to the cooling exotherm is greatest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In addition, if the reaction chamber is depressurized (e.g. to allow the library to be removed so that activators may be added), the gaseous monomers begin to outgas from the solutions in the wells of the library. As a result, the gaseous monomers are no longer present at the same concentration that they were when under pressure. For polymerization reactions involving more than one olefinic monomer, this may mean that the monomer ratios are different at the time of activation. This event creates a less than ideal situation because the monomer ratio and concentration may be critical to catalyst performance as well as polymer composition, property and structure&mdash;especially for highly active catalyst systems. Moreover, the workflow described above may not be readily adapted to allow screening of more than one library at a time. This is because the aforementioned outgassing effects would be significantly exacerbated in the time between activation of successive libraries. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Therefore, it would be desirable to generate the active catalyst in-situ, and preferably, after pressure and (subsequently) temperature equilibration have been reached without the need to depressurize the reaction chamber in order to remove and activate the catalyst precursor libraries. Additionally, it would also be desirable to increase the overall experimental throughput capacity of screening systems to permit screening of multiple samples or libraries in parallel or using serial methods. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In general, an apparatus for screening the samples may include an enclosed, pressure and temperature sealed reaction chamber, a transport assembly for transferring one or more libraries into the sealed reaction chamber and an injection module for permitting the injection of chemical components into the sealed reaction chamber. The injection step may occur when the sealed reaction chamber is at a temperature and pressure different from or equal to ambient conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> One method of using the screening apparatus includes the steps of transferring one or more libraries into the reaction chamber and sealing the reaction chamber once the libraries are in position. At this point, the chamber may be filled with a charging agent such as a monomer or other chemical components that contact the samples. For example, the charging agent may be a polymerizable olefin such as ethylene, propylene, isobutylene, etc. Once the charging agent has been added, the system may be allowed to equilibrate at a desired temperature and pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> While the apparatus is under equilibrated conditions, chemical components may be injected in-situ into the reaction chamber to provoke or stimulate a chemical reaction or induce other chemical or physical changes in the respective samples. The chemical components may be injected into the reaction chamber via the injection module such that the chemical components may be applied to the respective samples of a library as desired or simply injected into the reaction chamber and allowed to come into contact with the samples. More specifically, each sample plate containing a library of samples may be transported to an injection module. It will be appreciated that the apparatus may include two or more sample plates, each sample plate supporting a library of samples. More particularly, the apparatus may include four or more sample plates, and even more particularly, the apparatus may include eight or more sample plates. And even more particularly, the apparatus may include ten or more sample plates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Regardless of the number of sample plates included in the apparatus, the transportation of the sample plates and the in-situ injection of the chemical components into the reaction chamber or directly onto respective samples may take place without increasing or decreasing the pressure in the reaction chamber. It will be appreciated that all of the libraries are exposed to the same reaction conditions, (i.e., reaction chamber temperature and pressure). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the apparatus may be used in, but not limited to, the follow manner: the chemical components may be injected into the reaction chamber or directly onto respective samples without charging the reaction chamber, i.e., the reaction chamber is not pre-pressurized with a charging agent, or the apparatus can simply be charged with the charging agent and no other chemical components injected into the reaction chamber or onto the respective samples. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The chemical or physical changes of the samples in response to either the charging agent, or other chemical components or both may be monitored by coupling the reaction chamber to a data gathering device such as, but not limited to, an infrared camera, thermocouple, thermister or other similar device. For instance, an infrared camera may be used to monitor endothermic/exothermic reactions or other changes taking place within the library or specific samples comprising the library. Once the data gathering phase has been completed, the apparatus may be evacuated under vacuum pressure or purged with a fluid such as an inert gas and prepared for additional screenings. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The pneumatic cylinders <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> are lock on retract-type cylinders, which are well known in the industry. For example, once the pneumatic cylinders <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> are retracted, the pneumatic cylinders <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> become locked in the retracted position. The pneumatic cylinders <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> will remain in the locked position until the opposite side of the cylinder housing is pressurized. The locking mechanism for the pneumatic cylinders <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is a mechanical lock as opposed to a friction lock. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The operation of the cylinders <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> may be controlled manually or via a computer, wherein the computer can issue a command causing air under pressure to flow in the cylinder chamber, causing retraction of the cylinders <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. This arrangement brings the housing <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> into sealing contact with the house <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and the application of air pressure to the opposite side of they cylinders <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> separates the housings <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

Both solenoid valves <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are coupled to a relay <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, wherein the relay is essentially a pressure sensor. When the pressure of the reaction chamber <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> exceeds a set point, for example 5 PSI, the relay <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> disconnects power from the solenoid valve <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Thus, the solenoid valve <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>closes, disconnecting pneumatic control of the pneumatic cylinders. The other solenoid valve <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is electrically coupled to the power supply for the apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and when the relay <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> is activated, the solenoid <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is disconnected from the power supply to the apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. It will be appreciated that the preset pressure for activating the relay <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> could be set higher or lower than the 5 PSI setting discussed herein. It will be appreciated that a single solenoid valve <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may be coupled to the relay <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> rather than two as described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> In operation, the simultaneous extension and retraction of each rod of the pneumatic cylinders <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> causes the housing <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> to traverse a linear path. One of skill in the art will appreciate that hydraulic or electrically operated cylinders could be substituted for the pneumatic cylinders <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. One of skill in the art will also appreciate that other conventional linear drive systems such as a rack and pinion, or gear drives could be used in place of the pair of pneumatic cylinders <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. It will also be appreciated that the cylinder <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> may be operated manually. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> Operation </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> Generally, when the reaction chamber <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is sealed, the screening process can begin. However, prior to beginning the screening process, the reaction chamber <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> may be sealed and then pressurized with a charging agent. Alternatively, the reaction chamber <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> may be sealed and not pressurized or the reaction chamber <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> may not be sealed during a screening cycle. One method of operating the screening apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will be discussed herein, wherein the reaction chamber <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is sealed and pressurized by a charging agent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> The operation of the screening apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may include the steps of (1) loading one or more libraries of samples into the reaction chamber <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, (2) sealing the reaction chamber <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, (3) introducing a charging agent into the sealed reaction chamber <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, (4) in-situ injection of chemical components into the reaction chamber <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, and (5) collecting data from two or more samples or libraries. These steps can be controlled by a computer or performed manually. Each of the aforementioned steps will be discussed in detail herein. However, one of skill in the art will appreciate that other methods may be used to operate the screening apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> Loading a Library of Samples into the Reaction Chamber: Operation of the Transport Assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, a sled <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> retaining a library of samples on the sample plate <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> may be loaded into the reaction chamber <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> by the transport assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In the disclosed embodiment, the sled <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and sample plate <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> may be manually placed onto the carriage <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, and the carriage <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> caused to move the sled <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and sample plate <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> into the reaction chamber <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> The carriage <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is driven by activating the magnetic feed through threaded rod drive mechanism. As the motor turns, the magnetic feed through causes the threaded rod <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> to rotate clockwise, thus, moving the carriage <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> forward into the reaction chamber <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> through opening <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> The magnetic feed through is of a type conventionally used in the industry, and may include a magnetic driver assembly having one end coupled to the belt drive assembly (FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) and the other end magnetically coupled to a magnetic follower. Rotation of the belt drive system induces a torque in the magnetic driver. Because of the magnetic coupling between the driver and the follower, rotation of the driver assembly induces rotation of the follower. The follower is coupled to the threaded rod <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> using generally known fastening and sealing techniques in order to maintain a pressure tight seal between the point of entry of the magnetic feed through into the housing <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. Hence, rotation of the follower results in rotation of the threaded rod <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, and as a result, the carriage <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, which is movably supported on the threaded rod <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, is caused to linearly traverse the threaded rod <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> when the magnetic feed through and belt drive are activated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, once the carriage <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and sled <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> are inside the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the carriage <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is brought to rest above the recessed surface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> formed in the bottom surface <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. After the sled <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> is in position, the carriage <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is retracted, yet the sled <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> remains in the recess <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the bellows <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the pneumatic cylinder <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> align directly below the recess <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. When the pneumatic cylinder <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is extended, the bellows <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> contacts the sled <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, lifting the sled <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> out of the recess <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and depositing the sled <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> in the slot <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> When the sled <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> is received in the slot <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, the indexing pins <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> supported by the outer periphery of the sled <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> are received in the indents <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, thus securing the sled <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> in position in the slot <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> when the pneumatic cylinder <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, and hence the bellows <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, is retracted. Once the sled <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> is positioned in the slot <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, the sample plate <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is visible through the open top of the slot <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, to position an empty slot <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> above the sled <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> located in the recess <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the carousel <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may be selectively rotated by the stepper motor <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> magnetic feed through <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> until an empty slot <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is positioned above the sled <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>. It will be appreciated that the structure of the magnetic feed through <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> is identical to that used to drive the carriage <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. Hence, a description of its operation will not be repeated here. One of skill in the art will appreciate that rotation of the carousel <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may be manually or computer controlled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> To load a second sled <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and sample plate <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> assembly into a respective slot <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, repeat the procedure described above until the desired number of slots <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> have been filled. To remove a sled <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> from a slot <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, the aforementioned process may be reversed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> Sealing the Reaction Chamber <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> Once the desired number of slots <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> has been filled, the housing <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is caused to move into sealing engagement with the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by retracting the pneumatic cylinders <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. At this point, the reaction chamber <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> may be pressurized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> Introducing a Charging Agent into the Sealed Reaction Chamber </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> After sealing the reaction chamber <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, a charging agent may be introduced into the reaction chamber <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. In a preferred embodiment, the charging agent is a polymerizable gas that eventually becomes dissolved or absorbed into the respective samples comprising the library. Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the charging agent is introduced into the reaction chamber <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> through the inlet ports <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the sidewall <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and bottom surface <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The charging agent may be injected into the reaction chamber <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> such that homogenous mixing of the fluid takes place. The apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be configured to permit one or more charging agents to be introduced into the reaction chamber <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> simultaneously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> In the disclosed embodiment, the charging agent may be a gaseous monomer. More specifically, the charging agent may be ethylene gas introduced into the reaction chamber <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> under pressure. For instance, the gas could be introduced into the reaction chamber <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> at a pressure of approximately 60 PSI. One of skill in the art will appreciate that the other chemical components may be used as the charging agent, and that pressure levels may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> In-Situ Injection of Chemical Components onto one or more Libraries </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> The in-situ injection of chemical components into the reaction chamber <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> may take place at any point or under any conditions prior to, during the course of, or after the screening. The process of in-situ injection can be computer controlled. For example, a computer can be programmed with software for controlling the sequence of the injections, as well as the timing for the injections. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> Referring back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, to apply additional chemistry to a library, the transport assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is activated causing the carriage <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to move into the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a sled <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> supporting a sample plate <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is removed from slot <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> in the manner previously described. The removal of the sled <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> from the slot <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the subsequent transportation of the sled <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> to the injection module <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may occur without breaking the sealing contact between the housings <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, the sled <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> may be moved incrementally under the injection manifold <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> such that desired injectors <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> of the injection manifold <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> align with selected samples supported by the sled <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>. It will be appreciated that the injection manifold <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is activated using conventional techniques to cause one or more chemical components to be applied to two or more samples retained on the sample plate <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> Once the desired chemical components have been added to the library or selected samples of the library, the sled <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> is returned to the reaction re-inserted into the slot <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> from which it was removed. This aforementioned process may be repeated until all desired sample plates <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> have been treated with one or more chemical components and returned to the respective slot <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> Collecting Data from One or More Libraries </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> Data gathering may commence once the desired chemical components or charging agents have been added to the samples. As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, to gather data concerning the samples under consideration, the carousel <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is rotated so that a slot <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> supporting a library of samples is directly under the opening <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 10</cross-reference>, the opening <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is directly below the sapphire window <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>(<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>) and the line of sight of the IR camera assembly <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Thus, the infrared camera <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, when activated, may collect digital images (e.g., photographs) of the library through the sapphire window <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, recording exothermic/endothermic reactions at each of the samples. Hence, the camera <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>l<highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>detects and records the intensity of infrared radiation passing through the sapphire window <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> The operation of the infrared camera <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>may be manually or computer controlled. In the disclosed embodiment, the operation of the infrared camera <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is controlled by a computer programmed with specific instructions for controlling the frequency and duration at which the digital images are taken over a given time period. The computer software also coordinates and synchronizes the picture taking activity of the camera <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>with the rotation of the carousel <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to align a slot <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> below the opening <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment, data may be gathered by coupling appropriate electrical components or probes to one or more samples supported by each sample support plate <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> via the electrical feed through <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight>. For example, data characterizing thermal characteristics of reaction or other material properties may be measured by coupling a thermister or thermocouple to the sample plate <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> at each of the sample wells or the individual samples themselves via the electrical feed through <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight>. Again, the collection of data via the electrical feed through <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> may be performed manually or by and appropriately programmed computer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> After the data gathering process has been completed, the system may be evacuated, purged, and the process described herein repeated. </paragraph>
