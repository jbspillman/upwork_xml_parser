<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to the art of optical micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) devices, and more particularly, to all-optical switching using MEMS devices. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> One solution for all-optical switching employs two MEMS devices each containing an array of tiltable micro mirrors, e.g., small mirrors, which can reflect light, which herein refers to any radiation in the wavelength of interest, whether or not in the visible spectrum. An optical path is established for light supplied from an input source, e.g., an optical fiber, to an output, e.g., an output fiber, by steering the light using a first micro mirror on the first optical MEMS device, the first micro mirror being associated with the input fiber, onto a second micro mirror on the second optical MEMS device which is associated with the output fiber. The second micro mirror then steers the light into the output fiber. Each fiber connected to the system is considered a port of the system, the input fibers being the input ports and the output fibers being the output ports. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Often, the light to be steered from the input fiber onto the first micro mirror of the first optical MEMS device first passes through a micro lens that is associated therewith and is part of an input micro lens array. The function of each micro lens is to collimate the beam of light supplied from its respective associated input fiber. Alternatively, in lieu of employing a separate micro lens array, a respective lens may be integrated with each fiber of the fiber bundle in an arrangement that forms a collimator. Similar arrangements of micro lens arrays or integrated lenses are also found interposed between the output MEMS device and the output fiber bundle in the output section of the all-optical switch. In the output section, the function of each micro lens or collinator is to couple the light beam into its respective associated output fiber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A problem in the art of all-optical switching using MEMS devices is that the center of any particular micro lens may not be lined up exactly with the center of its corresponding optical fiber. This causes the light beam to have a directional error, in that it does not travel directly toward the center of its associated micro mirror. If the distance between the micro lens and the MEMS device is large, which may be necessary to keep the input fiber bundle from blocking beams which are reflected from the micro mirrors of the MEMS device, the light beam will hit the micro mirror, if at all, off center. As a result, either no light will be reflected from the micro mirror if the beam does not hit the micro mirror at all, or the beam that is reflected will only represent part of the original beam, in that the part of the light beam that does not hit the micro mirror will be cut off, which results in attenuation of the light beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Similarly, in the output section, light which is reflected from an output micro mirror may not hit the micro lens, and as a result, will not be coupled into the output fiber. Alternatively, only part of the light may hit the micro lens, so that at most that part of the light could be coupled into the fiber. This results in attenuation of the light beam. Furthermore, even if the light hits the output micro lens, if the light comes in with an angle other than being parallel to the axis from the center of the micro lens to the fiber, then not all of the light reaching the micro lens will be coupled into the output fiber. Again, this results in attenuation of the light beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In other implementations of the all-optical switch, a micro lens array is not employed. Instead, each fiber has a lens integrated with it, to form a collimator, so that the light comes out as a parallel beam. While the fibers of the optical bundle may be made very regular, the direction in which the collimator lens is pointing may not be parallel to the line formed by the center of the lens and its associated micro mirror. This angle is often set by the angle of housing in which the collimators are mounted. If the angle of the lens is not parallel to the line formed by the center of the lens and its associated micro mirror, the light beam will have a directional error, in that it does not travel directly toward the center of its associated micro mirror. If the distance between the collimator and the MEMS device is large, which may be necessary to keep the input fiber bundle from blocking beams which are reflected from the micro mirrors of the MEMS device, the light beam will hit the micro mirror, if at all, off center. As a result, either no light will be reflected from the micro mirror if the beam does not hit the micro mirror at all, or the beam that is reflected will only represent part of the original beam, in that the part of the light beam that does not hit the micro mirror will be cut off, which results in attenuation of the light beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Similarly, in the output section, light which is reflected from an output micro mirror may not hit the collimator lens, and as a result, will not be coupled into the output fiber. Alternatively, only part of the light may hit the collimator lens, so that at most that part of the light could be coupled into the fiber. This results in attenuation of the light beam. Furthermore, even if the light hits the output micro lens, if the light comes in with an angle other than being parallel to the axis from the center of the micro lens to the fiber, then not all of the light reaching the micro lens will be coupled into the output fiber. Again, this results in attenuation of the light beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The same type of problem is manifest when using a wave guide in lieu of a fiber bundle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Although It is easy enough to perform the alignment to insure that the light beam follows the desired path when there is only a single input fiber or a single output fiber. However, when there is a bundle of input or output fibers&mdash;which may include a thousand or more fibers&mdash;getting all the beams to be parallel is a very difficult task. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> We have recognized that the foregoing problem of multiple light beams not being parallel and/or having an undesirable angle when they leave their source can be overcome by interposing an imaging system between the micro lens array and/or the collimators and the moveable micro mirrors of the MEMS device to which, or from which, the light beams are directed. Such an arrangement causes an image of the micro lens array and/or the collimators to be formed at the MEMS device, or vice-versa, due to the reversible nature of optics, thus effectively eliminating the distance between the micro lens array and/or the collimators and the MEMS device over which the light beams had previously traveled. Thus, advantageously, each light beam, even if not traveling in the desired direction parallel to the line formed by the center of its lens or collimator and its associated micro mirror does not get the opportunity to travel away from its intended target. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the system, the imaging system reproduces the angle of reflection of the light from the first micro mirror, which may be achieved using a telecentric system, also known as a <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> f system. The physical size of the arrangement may be reduced by compacting the optical path, e.g., using appropriate conventional mirrors, and/or employing folded arrangements, i.e., arrangements in which there is only one MEMS device stage that does double duty for both input and output through the use of at least one conventional mirror. The overall system is arranged to account for any inversions introduced.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The following merely illustrates the principles of the invention. It will thus be appreciated that those skilled in the art will be able to devise various arrangements which, although not explicitly described or shown herein, embody the principles of the invention and are included within its spirit and scope. Furthermore, all examples and conditional language recited herein are principally intended expressly to be only for pedagogical purposes to aid the reader in understanding the principles of the invention and the concepts contributed by the inventor(s) to furthering the art, and are to be construed as being without limitation to such specifically recited examples and conditions. Moreover, all statements herein reciting principles, aspects, and embodiments of the invention, as well as specific examples thereof, are intended to encompass both structural and functional equivalents thereof. Additionally, it is intended that such equivalents include both currently known equivalents as well as equivalents developed in the future, i.e., any elements developed that perform the same function, regardless of structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Thus, for example, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that any block diagrams herein represent conceptual views of illustrative circuitry embodying the principles of the invention. Similarly, it will be appreciated that any flow charts, flow diagrams, state transition diagrams, pseudocode, and the like represent various processes which may be substantially represented in computer readable medium and so executed by a computer or processor, whether or not such computer or processor is explicitly shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The functions of the various elements shown in the FIGs., including any functional blocks labeled as &ldquo;processors&rdquo;, may be provided through the use of dedicated hardware as well as hardware capable of executing software in association with appropriate software. When provided by a processor, the functions may be provided by a single dedicated processor, by a single shared processor, or by a plurality of individual processors, some of which may be shared. Moreover, explicit use of the term &ldquo;processor&rdquo; or &ldquo;controller&rdquo; should not be construed to refer exclusively to hardware capable of executing software, and may implicitly include, without limitation, digital signal processor (DSP) hardware, network processor, application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), field programmable gate array (FPGA), read-only memory (ROM) for storing software, random access memory (RAM), and non-volatile storage. Other hardware, conventional and/or custom, may also be included. Similarly, any switches shown in the FIGS. are conceptual only. Their function may be carried out through the operation of program logic, through dedicated logic, through the interaction of program control and dedicated logic, or even manually, the particular technique being selectable by the implementor as more specifically understood from the context. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In the claims hereof any element expressed as a means for performing a specified function is intended to encompass any way of performing that function including, for example, a) a combination of circuit elements which performs that function or b) software in any form, including, therefore, firmware, microcode or the like, combined with appropriate circuitry for executing that software to perform the function. The invention as defined by such claims resides in the fact that the functionalities provided by the various recited means are combined and brought together in the manner which the claims call for. Applicant thus regards any means which can provide those functionalities as equivalent as those shown herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Software modules, or simply modules which are implied to be software, may be represented herein as any combination of flowchart elements or other elements indicating performance of process steps and/or textual description. Such modules may be executed by hardware which is expressly or implicitly shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Unless otherwise explicitly specified herein, the drawings are not drawn to scale. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Additionally, unless otherwise explicitly specified herein, any lens shown and/or described herein is actually an optical system having the particular specified properties of that lens. Such an optical system may be implemented by a single lens element but is not necessarily limited thereto. Similarly, where a mirror is shown and/or described what is actually being shown and/or described is an optical system with the specified properties of such a mirror, which may be implemented by a single mirror element but is not necessarily limited to a single mirror element. This is because, as is well known in the art, various optical systems may provide the same functionality of a single lens element or mirror but in a superior way, e.g., with less distortion. Furthermore, as is well known in the art, the functionality of a curved mirror may be realized via a combination of lenses and mirrors and vice versa. Moreover, any arrangement of optical components that are performing a specified function, e.g., an imaging system, gratings, coated elements, and prisms, may be replaced by any other arrangement of optical components that perform the same specified function. Thus, unless otherwise explicitly specified here, all optical elements or systems that are capable of providing specific function within an overall embodiment disclosed herein are equivalent to one another for purposes of the present disclosure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The term micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) device as used herein is intended to mean an entire MEMS device or any portion thereof. Thus, if a portion of a MEMS device is inoperative, or if a portion of a MEMS device is occluded, such a MEMS device is nonetheless considered to be a MEMS device for purposes of the present disclosure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows an exemplary arrangement for performing optical switching in accordance with the principles of the invention. Shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> are a) input fiber bundle <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, b) input micro lens array <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, c) input MEMS device <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, d) lens <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, e) lens <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>, f) lens <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, g) output MEMS device <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>, h) lens <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>, i) lens <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>, j) output micro lens array <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>, and k) output fiber bundle <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Input fiber bundle <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> supplies optical signals to be switched. More specifically, each fiber of input fiber bundle <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is an input port to the switching system of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The light supplied by each fiber of fiber bundle <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> passes through a respective corresponding micro lens that is part of micro lens array <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. The function of each micro lens is to collimate the beam of light supplied from its respective associated input fiber. In alternative embodiments of the invention, in lieu of employing a separate micro lens array, a lens may be integrated with each fiber of fiber bundle <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> in an arrangement that forms a collimator, so that the light comes out as a parallel beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the principles of the invention, the beams of light passing from micro lens array <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> each falls upon the imaging system made up of lenses <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>, entering at lens <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and exiting at lens <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. The imaging system is arranged so as to cause an image of the micro lens array and/or the collimators to be formed at input MEMS device <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, or vice-versa, due to the reversible nature of optics, thus effectively eliminating the distance between micro lens array and/or collimators <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and input MEMS device <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> over which the light beams had effectively traveled in prior art arrangements. Thus, advantageously, each light beam, even if not traveling in the desired direction parallel to the line formed by the center of its micro lens or collimator and its associated micro mirror does not get the opportunity to travel away from its intended target. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Note that although two lenses are shown making up the imaging system, this is for pedagogical and clarity purposes only. Those of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that any imaging system, e.g., a system using one or more lenses, may be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the invention, a telecentric system, also known as a 4 f system is employed as the imaging system. By using a telecentric system, such systems being well known in the art, the angle of each beam as it exits from each of micro lens <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is reproduced when that light reaches input MEMS device <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. However, advantageously, this angle is reproduced directly at the plane of input MEMS device <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. As a result, the light beams do not have the ability to travel along the line of that angle and thus do not have the opportunity afforded to them of missing, in whole or in part, the micro mirror which is supposed to reflect them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Note that since the telecentric system may be inverting the respective corresponding micro mirrors of input MEMS device <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> may not be in the exact same location, e.g., on a direct line from input fiber bundle <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> as they would have been had the imaging system not been employed. The imaging system may also change the size of the image as compared with the original. This would allow the micro mirrors of input MEMS device <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> to have a different size and/or spacing than that of micro lens array and/or collimators <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. It would also allow the use of a fiber bundle without a micro lens array and/or collimators if the fill factor, i.e., the ratio between the spot size and the distance between the spots, between the fiber bundle and the micro mirrors of the MEMS device is substantially maintained. Furthermore, it is possible to employ optical splitters, e.g., between lenses <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>, to create multiple signal paths through the system, e.g., to implement a multicast, broadcast, monitoring, protection and restoration functions.

<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Each micro mirror of first input MEMS device <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is set to reflect the beam of light incident on it at a respective prescribed angle.

Any error that results from the light having entered the imaging system traveling along a direction that is not parallel to the line formed by the center of its lens or collimator and its associated micro mirror on first input MEMS device is compensated for by the &ldquo;training&rdquo; of the all-optical system so long as deviation angle of the light from the parallel is small compared to the maximum angle at which the mirror can be tilted. &ldquo;Training&rdquo; is the process of determining what voltages need be applied to the electrodes of each micro mirror to achieve the necessary tilt that provides the best connection between it and each other micro mirror of the opposing MEMS device, and what voltage needs to be applied to the electrodes of each of the opposing micro mirrors as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> After reflecting off of its particular micro mirror, each beam of light passes through optional lens <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> on its way to output MEMS device <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. Optional lens <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> acts as a field lens and translates the angle at which the light is incident onto each micro mirror into a position to which the light will be directed. This allows all the input micro mirrors to be homogenized, in that all micro mirrors having the same tilt will direct their light to the same position. Furthermore, the field lens refocuses each of the beams that pass through it, thus reducing loss. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The beams of light passing from lens <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> each falls upon a respective micro mirror of output MEMS device <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>.

Each particular prescribed angle is selected so that each light beam will be directed towards the respective fiber of output fiber bundle <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> which is to be the output fiber for the light beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> After reflecting off of its particular micro mirror and prior to reaching its respective output fiber, each beam of light passes through lens <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> and then lens <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>, which together form an imaging system. The imaging system is arranged so as to cause an image of output MEMS device <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> to be formed at output micro lens array <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> and/or collimators <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>, or vice-versa, due to the reversible nature of optics, thus effectively eliminating the distance between output MEMS device <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> and micro lens array and/or collimators <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> over which the light beams had effectively traveled in prior art arrangements. Thus, advantageously, each light beam, even if not traveling in the desired direction parallel to the line formed by the center of its micro lens or collimator and its associated micro mirror does not get the opportunity to travel away from its intended target. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> As previously indicated in connection with the lens of the input imaging system, although two lenses are shown making up the imaging system, this is for pedagogical and clarity purposes only. Those of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that any imaging system, e.g., a system using one or more lenses, may be employed. In one embodiment of the invention, a telecentric system is employed as the imaging system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Note that the imaging system may also change the size of the image as compared with the original. This would allow the micro mirrors of output MEMS device <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> to have a different size and/or spacing than that of micro lens array and/or collimators <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. It would also allow the use of a fiber bundle without a micro lens array and/or collimators if the fill factor, i.e., the ratio between the spot size and the distance between the spots, between the fiber bundle and the micro mirrors of the MEMS device is substantially maintained. Furthermore, it is possible to employ optical splitters, e.g., between lenses <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>, to create multiple signal paths through the system, e.g., to implement a multicast, broadcast, monitoring, protection and restoration functions.

<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The beams of light passing from lens <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> passes through a respective micro lens of micro lens array <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. The function of each micro lens is to collimate the beam of light supplied to its respective associated input fiber. In alternative embodiments of the invention, in lieu of employing a separate micro lens array, a lens may be integrated onto each output fiber of fiber bundle <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>, thus forming a collimator. The light from each of micro lens of micro lens array <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> then passes into the respective output fiber bundle that is associated with the micro lens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Note that in some embodiments of the invention only one imaging system need be employed. In such embodiments the imaging system may be employed only for the input or only for the output. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> provides a great improvement over the prior art arrangements. However, the performance is still somewhat limited, in that in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> input MEMS device <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is at an angle with respect to the plane at which the light beams are coming out from the fibers of input fiber bundle <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and similarly output MEMS device <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> is at an angle with respect to the plane at which light is entering the fibers of output fiber bundle <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>. As a result, the images of the fiber bundles formed by the respective imaging system are not exactly coplanar with their respective MEMS device, which causes the image to be slightly out of focus. Therefore, in accordance with an aspect of the invention, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is an exemplary all-optical switching arrangement in which the optical path is arranged to allow at least one of the MEMS devices to be parallel to the plane of light entering or exiting the fibers of its respective fiber bundle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In addition to the elements of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows mirrors with a hole <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight>. As in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, input fiber bundle <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> supplies optical signals to be switched. More specifically, each fiber of input fiber bundle <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is an input port to the switching system of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The light supplied by each fiber of fiber bundle <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> passes through a respective corresponding micro lens that is part of micro lens array <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. The function of each micro lens is to collimate the beam of light supplied from its respective associated input fiber. In alternative embodiments of the invention, in lieu of employing a separate micro lens array, a lens may be integrated with each fiber of fiber bundle <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> in an arrangement that forms a collimator, so that the light comes out as a parallel beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the principles of the invention, the beams of light passing from micro lens array <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> each falls upon the imaging system made up of lenses <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>, entering at lens <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and exiting at lens <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. The imaging system is arranged so as to cause an image of the micro lens array and/or the collimators to be formed at input MEMS device <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, or vice-versa, due to the reversible nature of optics, thus effectively eliminating the distance between micro lens array and/or collimators <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and input MEMS device <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> over which the light beams had effectively traveled in prior art arrangements. Thus, advantageously, each light beam, even if not traveling in the desired direction parallel to the line formed by the center of its micro lens or collimator and its associated micro mirror does not get the opportunity to travel away from its intended target. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the invention, a telecentric system, also known as a 4 f system is employed as the imaging system. By using a telecentric system, such systems being well known in the art, the angle of each beam as it exits from each of micro lens <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is reproduced when that light reaches input MEMS device <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. However, advantageously, this angle is reproduced directly at the plane of input MEMS device <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. As a result, the light beams do not have the ability to travel along the line of that angle and thus do not have the opportunity afforded to them of missing the micro mirror which is supposed to reflect them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Note that since the telecentric system may be inverting the respective corresponding micro mirrors of input MEMS device <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> may not be in the exact same location, e.g., on a direct line from input fiber bundle <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> as they would have been had the imaging system not been employed. The imaging system may also change the size of the image as compared with the original. This would allow the micro mirrors of input MEMS device <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> to have a different size and/or spacing than that of micro lens array and/or collimators <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. It would also allow the use of a fiber bundle without a micro lens array and/or collimators if the fill factor, i.e., the ratio between the spot size and the distance between the spots, between the fiber bundle and the micro mirrors of the MEMS device is substantially maintained. Furthermore, it is possible to employ optical splitters, e.g., between lenses <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>, to create multiple signal paths through the system, e.g., to implement a multicast, broadcast, monitoring, protection and restoration functions. Advantageously, great flexibility in system design is achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In accordance with an aspect of the invention, mirror with a hole <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> is inserted between lens <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> so that the hole of mirror with a hole <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> is at the focal point of lens <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. By having the hole of mirror with a hole <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> at the focal point of lens <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> all of the light entering the imaging system passes through the focal point and hence through the hole undisturbed by mirror <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>. Light exiting the imaging system proceeds to input MEMS device <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, which is arranged to be parallel to the plane of light exiting input fiber bundle <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Each micro mirror of first input MEMS device <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is set to reflect the beam of light incident on it at a respective prescribed angle.

Any error that results from the light having entered the imaging system traveling along a direction that is not parallel to the line formed by the center of its lens or collimator and its associated micro mirror is compensated for by the training of the all-optical system so long as deviation angle of the light from the parallel is small compared to the maximum angle at which the mirror can be tilted. </paragraph>

Likewise, depending on geometry and the size of the hole in the mirrors with a hole, it is possible that other micro mirrors surrounding the center micro mirror may not be useable as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> After reflecting off of its particular micro mirror, each beam of light passes through an imaging system made up of lens <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>, mirror with a hole <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> and lens <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. This imaging system produces an image of input MEMS device <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> at mirror with a hole <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight>. This image of input MEMS device can be considered to be a virtual input MEMS device. Light from the image of input MEMS device <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> reflect off of mirror with a hole <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> and goes toward output MEMS device <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>, passing through lens <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>. In this capacity, lens <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> acts as a field lens. The field lens translates the angle at which the light is incident onto each micro mirror into a position to which the light will be directed. This allows all the input micro mirrors to be homogenized, in that all micro mirrors having the same tilt will direct their light to the same position. Furthermore, the field lens refocuses each of the beams that pass through it, thus reducing loss. </paragraph>

Advantageously, output MEMS device <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> is arranged to be parallel to the plane of light entering output fiber bundle <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>, thus eliminating the focus problem of the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Each beam of light passing from lens <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> passes through a respective micro lens of micro lens array <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>.

In such embodiments the imaging system may be employed only for the input or only for the output. Note also that although in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> the angle of the mirrors with a hole appears to be 45 degrees, such a particular angle is not required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Any mirror with a hole may not have an actual physical hole but may employ in lieu thereof a region at the desired location of the hole that is transparent to the wavelength of light that is being switched by the all optical switch.

<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows another arrangement for the all-optical switching arrangement of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> but in which instead of using mirrors with a hole <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> uses small mirrors <highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>423</bold></highlight> at the focal points of various ones of the imaging system.

<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> After reflecting off of its particular micro mirror, each beam of light passes through an imaging system made up of lens <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> and lens <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. This imaging system produces an image of input MEMS device <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> at the plane which intersects small mirror <highlight><bold>423</bold></highlight> and is parallel to input MEMS device <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. This image of input MEMS device can be considered to be a virtual input MEMS device. Light from the image of input MEMS device <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> continues toward output MEMS device <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>, passing through lens <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>. In this capacity, lens <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> acts as a field lens. The field lens translates the angle at which the light is incident onto each micro mirror into a position to which the light will be directed. This allows all the input micro mirrors to be homogenized, in that all micro mirrors having the same tilt will direct their light to the same position. Furthermore, the field lens refocuses each of the beams that pass through it, thus reducing loss. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The beams of light passing from the field lens each falls upon a respective micro mirror of output MEMS device <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. Each micro mirror of output MEMS device <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> is set to reflect the beam of light incident on it at a respective prescribed angle. Each particular prescribed angle is selected so that each light beam will be directed towards the respective fiber of output fiber bundle <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> which is to be the output fiber for the light beam, had output fiber bundle <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> been along the path between output MEMS device <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> and input MEMS device <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> However, after reflecting off of its particular micro mirror and prior to reaching its respective output fiber, each beam of light passes through an imaging system which is made up of lens <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>, small mirror <highlight><bold>423</bold></highlight>, and lens <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>. The imaging system is arranged so as to cause an image of output MEMS device <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> to be formed at output micro lens array <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> and/or collimators <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>, or vice-versa, due to the reversible nature of optics, which is located at a right angle to the path between output MEMS device <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> and input MEMS device <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. This change in direction is achieved by small mirror <highlight><bold>423</bold></highlight> which is located at the focal point of lens <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>. The imaging system thus changes the direction of the optical path and it also effectively eliminates the distance between output MEMS device <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> and micro lens array and/or collimators <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> over which the light beams had effectively traveled in prior art arrangements. Thus, advantageously, each light beam, even if not traveling in the desired direction parallel to the line formed by the center of its micro lens or collimator and its associated micro mirror does not get the opportunity to travel away from its intended target. </paragraph>

It would also allow the use of a fiber bundle without a micro lens array and/or collimators if the fill factor, i.e., the ratio between the spot size and the distance between the spots, between the fiber bundle and the micro mirrors of the MEMS device is substantially maintained. Furthermore, it is possible to employ optical splitters, e.g., between lenses <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>, to create multiple signal paths through the system, e.g., to implement a multicast, broadcast, monitoring, protection and restoration functions.

The field lens translates the angle at which the light is incident onto each micro mirror into a position to which the light will be directed. This allows all the input micro mirrors to be homogenized, in that all micro mirrors having the same tilt will direct their light to the same position. Furthermore, the field lens refocuses each of the beams that pass through it, thus reducing loss. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> The beams of light passing from the field lens each falls upon a respective micro mirror of output MEMS device with a mirror <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight>. Each micro mirror of output MEMS device with a mirror <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight> is set to reflect the beam of light incident on it at a respective prescribed angle. The particular prescribed angle is selected so that each light beam will be directed towards the respective fiber of output fiber bundle <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> which is to be the output fiber for the light beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> After reflecting off of its particular micro mirror and prior to reaching its respective output fiber, each beam of light passes through lens <highlight><bold>613</bold></highlight> and then lens <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>, which together form an imaging system. The imaging system is arranged so as to cause an image of output MEMS device with a mirror <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight> and/or the collimators to be formed at output micro lens array <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> and/or collimators <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>, or vice-versa, due to the reversible nature of optics, thus effectively eliminating the distance between output MEMS device with a mirror <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight> and micro lens array and/or collimators <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> over which the light beams had effectively traveled in prior art arrangements. Thus, advantageously, each light beam, even if not traveling in the desired direction parallel to the line formed by the center of its micro lens or collimator and its associated micro mirror does not get the opportunity to travel away from its intended target. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> In accordance with an aspect of the invention, input MEMS device with a mirror <highlight><bold>805</bold></highlight> is inserted between lens <highlight><bold>613</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> so that mirror <highlight><bold>835</bold></highlight> of input MEMS device with a mirror <highlight><bold>805</bold></highlight> is at the focal point of the lens <highlight><bold>613</bold></highlight>. By having mirror <highlight><bold>835</bold></highlight> of input MEMS device with a mirror <highlight><bold>835</bold></highlight> at the focal point of the imaging system all of the light entering the imaging system passes through the focal point and hence is reflected by mirror <highlight><bold>835</bold></highlight> of input MEMS device with a mirror <highlight><bold>805</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> As previously indicated in connection with the lens of the input imaging system, although two lenses are shown making up the imaging system, this is for pedagogical and clarity purposes only. Those of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that any imaging system, e.g., a system using one or more lenses, may be employed. In one embodiment of the invention, a telecentric system is employed as the imaging system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Note that the imaging system may also change the size of the image as compared with the original. This would allow the micro mirrors of output MEMS device with a mirror <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight> to have a different size and/or spacing than that of micro lens array and/or collimators <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. It would also allow the use of a fiber bundle without a micro lens array and/or collimators if the fill factor, i.e., the ratio between the spot size and the distance between the spots, between the fiber bundle and the micro mirrors of the MEMS device is substantially maintained. Furthermore, it is possible to employ optical splitters, e.g., between lenses <highlight><bold>613</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>, to create multiple signal paths through the system, e.g., to implement a multicast, broadcast, monitoring, protection and restoration functions. Advantageously, great flexibility in system design is achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Each beam of light passing from lens <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> passes through a respective micro lens of micro lens array <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. The function of each micro lens is to collimate the beam of light supplied to its respective associated input fiber. In alternative embodiments of the invention, in lieu of employing a separate micro lens array, a lens may be integrated onto each output fiber of fiber bundle <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>, thus forming a collimator. The light from each of micro lens of micro lens array <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> then passes into the respective output fiber bundle that is associated with the micro lens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Note that there can be no micro mirrors employed for switching where the mirror of a MEMS device with a mirror is located. Further note that although the mirror is shown and described as being in the &ldquo;center&rdquo; of the MEMS devices, it need not be in the center. Those of ordinary skill in the art will be able to place the mirror at different locations and develop additional operational embodiments. Any changes in the lens arrangements or angles of the components to compensate for the different locations of the holes will be readily developed by those of ordinary skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> In the foregoing, designations of input and output fiber bundles, MEMS devices, and the like are primarily for pedagogical purposes, because each cross connected fiber pair may actually have between them a bi-directional connection. However, an input fiber may not receive light to output from any output fiber other than the one to which the input fiber&apos;s light is being directed as an output. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows folded embodiment of the all-optical switching arrangement shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. Shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> are a) fiber bundle <highlight><bold>901</bold></highlight>, b) micro lens array <highlight><bold>903</bold></highlight>, c) MEMS device with a mirror <highlight><bold>905</bold></highlight>, d) lens <highlight><bold>907</bold></highlight>, and e) curved mirror <highlight><bold>913</bold></highlight>. Unlike the previously described embodiments, fiber bundle <highlight><bold>901</bold></highlight> contains both input fibers, which supply light, and output fibers, which receive light, so that fiber bundle <highlight><bold>901</bold></highlight> acts as both input and output ports. However, such designations of input and output fibers are primarily for pedagogical purposes, because each cross connected fiber pairs may actually have between them a bi-directional connection. Any particular fiber which the user designates as an input fiber can be paired with any other fiber which the user may choose to designate as an output fiber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Light supplied from input fibers of fiber bundle <highlight><bold>901</bold></highlight> passes through a respective associated micro lens of first micro lens array <highlight><bold>903</bold></highlight>. The function of each micro lens is to collimate the beam of light supplied from its respective associated input fiber. In alternative embodiments of the invention, in lieu of employing a separate micro lens array, a lens may be integrated with each fiber of fiber bundle <highlight><bold>901</bold></highlight> in an arrangement that forms a collimator, so that the light comes out as a parallel beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the principles of the invention, the beams of light passing from micro lens array <highlight><bold>903</bold></highlight> each falls upon the imaging system made up of lens <highlight><bold>907</bold></highlight>, mirror <highlight><bold>935</bold></highlight> of MEMS device with a mirror <highlight><bold>905</bold></highlight>, and curved mirror <highlight><bold>913</bold></highlight>. The light enters at lens <highlight><bold>907</bold></highlight> and exits at curved mirror <highlight><bold>913</bold></highlight> after having been redirected at mirror <highlight><bold>925</bold></highlight>, which is substantially at the focal point of lens <highlight><bold>907</bold></highlight>. Mirror <highlight><bold>935</bold></highlight> is also located substantially at the focal point of curved mirror <highlight><bold>935</bold></highlight>. The imaging system is arranged so as to cause an image of the micro lens array and/or the collimators to be formed at MEMS device with a mirror <highlight><bold>905</bold></highlight>, or vice-versa, due to the reversible nature of optics, thus effectively eliminating the distance between micro lens array and/or collimators <highlight><bold>903</bold></highlight> and MEMS device with a mirror <highlight><bold>905</bold></highlight> over which the light beams had effectively traveled in prior art arrangements. Thus, advantageously, each light beam, even if not traveling in the desired direction parallel to the line formed by the center of its micro lens or collimator and its associated micro mirror does not get the opportunity to travel away from its intended target. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> MEMS device with a mirror <highlight><bold>905</bold></highlight> has the same structure as MEMS device with a mirror <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight> which is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> By having the mirror of MEMS device with a mirror <highlight><bold>905</bold></highlight> at the focal point of lens <highlight><bold>907</bold></highlight> all of the light entering the imaging system passes through the focal point, and hence is reflected by mirror <highlight><bold>935</bold></highlight> of MEMS device with a mirror <highlight><bold>905</bold></highlight>. Light exiting the imaging system proceeds to MEMS device with a mirror <highlight><bold>905</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the invention, a telecentric system, also known as a 4 f system is employed as the imaging system. By using a telecentric system, such systems being well known in the art, the angle of each beam as it exits from each of micro lens <highlight><bold>903</bold></highlight> is reproduced when that light reaches the MEMS device with a mirror <highlight><bold>905</bold></highlight>. However, advantageously, this angle is reproduced directly at the plane of MEMS device with a mirror <highlight><bold>905</bold></highlight>. As a result, the light beams do not have the ability to travel along the line of that angle and thus do not have the opportunity afforded to them of missing the micro mirror which is supposed to reflect them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Note that since the telecentric system may be inverting the respective corresponding micro mirrors of input MEMS device with a mirror <highlight><bold>905</bold></highlight> may not be in the exact same location, e.g., on a direct line from input fiber bundle <highlight><bold>901</bold></highlight> as they would have been had the imaging system not been employed. Note that the imaging system may also change the size of the image as compared with the original. This would allow the micro mirrors of MEMS device with a mirror <highlight><bold>905</bold></highlight> to have a different size and/or spacing than that of micro lens array and/or collimators <highlight><bold>903</bold></highlight>. It would also allow the use of a fiber bundle without a micro lens array and/or collimators if the fill factor, i.e., the ratio between the spot size and the distance between the spots, between the fiber bundle and the micro mirrors of the MEMS device is substantially maintained. Furthermore, it is possible to employ optical splitters, e.g., between lens <highlight><bold>907</bold></highlight> and curved mirror <highlight><bold>913</bold></highlight>, to create multiple signal paths through the system, e.g., to implement a multicast, broadcast, monitoring, protection and restoration functions. Advantageously, great flexibility in system design is achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Each micro mirror of MEMS device <highlight><bold>905</bold></highlight> is set to reflect the beam of light incident on it at a respective prescribed angle. Each particular prescribed angle is selected so that the beam will be directed to a prescribed micro mirror on MEMS device with a mirror <highlight><bold>905</bold></highlight> that corresponds to the particular output fiber of fiber bundle <highlight><bold>901</bold></highlight> to which the light is being directed as an output after the light is reflected by curved mirror <highlight><bold>913</bold></highlight>, which also performs the function of a field lens. The field lens function translates the angle at which the light is incident onto each micro mirror into a position to which the light will be directed. This allows all the input micro mirrors to be homogenized, in that all micro mirrors having the same tilt will direct their light to the same position. Furthermore, the field lens refocuses each of the beams that pass through it, thus reducing loss. Any error that results from the light having entered the imaging system traveling along a direction that is not parallel to the line formed by the center of its lens or collimator and its associated micro mirror is compensated for by the training of the all-optical system so long as deviation angle of the light from the parallel is small compared to the maximum angle at which the mirror can be tilted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> The beams of light passing back from the curved mirror <highlight><bold>913</bold></highlight> each falls upon a respective micro mirror of MEMS device with a mirror <highlight><bold>905</bold></highlight> which is an output micro mirror in that it is used to direct the light to a particular fiber of fiber bundle <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> via which the light will be supplied as an output. Each output micro mirror of MEMS device with a mirror <highlight><bold>905</bold></highlight> is set to reflect the beam of light incident on it at a respective prescribed angle selected so that each light beam will be directed towards its respective output fiber of fiber bundle <highlight><bold>901</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> After reflecting off of its particular output micro mirror and prior to reaching its respective output fiber, each beam of light passes through the imaging system formed by curved mirror <highlight><bold>913</bold></highlight>, mirror <highlight><bold>935</bold></highlight>, and lens <highlight><bold>907</bold></highlight>. This imaging system is the same imaging system through which the input light beams initially passed. As previously explained, the imaging system is arranged so as to cause an image of MEMS device with a mirror <highlight><bold>905</bold></highlight> to be formed at micro lens array <highlight><bold>903</bold></highlight> and/or collimators <highlight><bold>903</bold></highlight>, or vice-versa, due to the reversible nature of optics, thus effectively eliminating the distance between output MEMS device with a mirror <highlight><bold>905</bold></highlight> and micro lens array and/or collimators <highlight><bold>903</bold></highlight> over which the light beams had effectively traveled in prior art arrangements. Thus, advantageously, each light beam, even if not traveling in the desired direction parallel to the line formed by the center of its micro lens or collimator and its associated micro mirror does not get the opportunity to travel away from its intended target. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> Each output beam of light passing from lens <highlight><bold>907</bold></highlight> passes through a respective micro lens of micro lens array <highlight><bold>903</bold></highlight>. The light from each of micro lens of micro lens array <highlight><bold>903</bold></highlight> then passes into the respective output fiber of fiber bundle <highlight><bold>901</bold></highlight> that is associated with the micro lens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Note that there can be no micro mirrors employed for switching where the mirror of a MEMS device with a mirror is located. Further note that although the mirror is shown and described as being in the &ldquo;center&rdquo; of the MEMS devices, it need not be in the center. Those of ordinary skill in the art will be able to place the mirror at different locations and develop additional operational embodiments. Any changes in the lens arrangements or angles of the components to compensate for the different locations of the holes will be readily developed by those of ordinary skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> As noted, the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a folded version of the invention. Those of ordinary skill in the art will readily be able to develop folded versions of other embodiments of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Note that instead of optical fibers supplying the light beams as inputs, they may be supplied by an optical source, e.g., a laser or light emitting diode, planar wave guides, or the like. Likewise, instead of having optical fibers receiving the light beams as outputs the light beams could be received by other receivers such as photo detectors, planar wave guides, or the like. </paragraph>
