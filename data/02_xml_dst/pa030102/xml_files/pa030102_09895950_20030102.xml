<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to an umbrella tilt mechanism. More particularly, this invention relates to a tilt mechanism for an outdoor umbrella. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> As is known, outdoor umbrellas have frequently been provided with mechanisms which permit an upper end of an umbrella pole to tilt relative to a lower end of the umbrella pole. One conventional tilt mechanism includes a bifurcated piece mounted in a fixed lower pole portion and a stem mounted on the lower end of the upper tiltable portion. This stem is pivotally mounted via a pivot pin in the bifurcated piece and a manually operated slide lock is provided to lock the stem in one of three positions relative to the bifurcated piece. Such a tilt mechanism is described and illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 5,871,024. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> It is an object of this invention to provide a tilt mechanism for an umbrella which is of relatively simple robust construction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the invention to provide a tilt mechanism for an outdoor umbrella which can be readily manipulated by a user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Briefly, the invention provides a tilt mechanism for an umbrella which is comprised of a pair of tubular members that are to be secured to and between two sections of an umbrella pole. In addition, the tilt mechanism includes a catch that is fixedly mounted in one of the members and that projects into the other of the members to receive a locking pin mounted in the other member. The pin and the catch are moveable relative to each other in order to release the pin from the catch to allow the umbrella pole sections to be tilted relative to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The tilt mechanism further comprises a spring means for biasing the pin toward the catch and into one of several recesses in the end face of the catch to lock the tubular members relative to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The pin projects through elongated slots in the tubular member within which the pin is mounted and each end is provided with a rounded head or the like to facilitate manual contact. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Typically, the catch of the tilt mechanism is mounted in the tubular member which is secured to the upper section of an umbrella pole while the pin is mounted in the tubular member which is secured to the lower section of an umbrella pole. In this embodiment, in order to tilt the upper section of the umbrella pole relative to the lower section, the projecting ends of the pin are digitally grasped and pulled downwardly against the force of the spring means. The pin is thus released from the catch so that the upper section of the umbrella pole is free to tilt relative to the lower section. The extent of the tilt is determined by the end of the catch abutting against the inside of the lower tubular member. At this point, the pin is released so that the spring means biases the pin into the recess in the catch which is now aligned with the pin so that the pin locks the catch in place and, thus, the upper umbrella section relative to the lower umbrella section. Subsequent tilting of the upper section of the umbrella into an upright or oppositely tilted position may be carried out in a similar fashion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The tilt mechanism may be employed with a wood umbrella pole or a metal umbrella pole. </paragraph>

<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the umbrella <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is constructed and sized for use with outdoor furniture, particularly a table <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> having an aperture <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in a center region to receive the umbrella <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. As indicated, the umbrella <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is formed of a frame <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and a cover <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The frame <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> includes a pole <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, e.g., of solid wood construction, a yoke <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which is fixedly mounted on the pole <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and a second yoke <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> which is moveably mounted on the pole <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> above the fixed yoke <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A plurality of radially disposed ribs <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are pivotally connected to the moveable yoke <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> while struts <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are pivotally connected to the fixed yoke <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and to the ribs <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The ribs <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are provided with slots <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and pivots <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> for articulation purposes. Likewise, each strut <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is secured within a slot <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the yoke <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> by a screw <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> A lever means <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> which includes an elongated lever <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> secured by a rivet <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> to one of the ribs <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is employed for raising and lowering of the ribs <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The construction of the umbrella of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is well-known and employs a tilt mechanism of known construction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, the tilt mechanism <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the invention is incorporated between an upper section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and a lower section <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of an umbrella pole. The tilt mechanism <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> includes a pair of tubular members <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, which have contoured interfitting end-surfaces <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to define a smooth, cylindrical contour therebetween when the tubular members <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are in coaxial alignment with each other as viewed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The upper tubular member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> has a cylindrical bore <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> at an upper end to receive the upper wood section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of the umbrella pole, while the lower tubular member <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> has a bore <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> at the lower end to receive the lower wood section <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the pole. As indicated, a spring pin <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> passes through each respective tubular member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> into the wood pole section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in order to secure the tubular members <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> in place. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> A catch <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is fixedly mounted in the upper tubular member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> via a rivet or pin <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. In addition, the catch <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> has a stem <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> which projects into the lower tubular member <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and which is fixed therein by a rivet or pin <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. This rivet or pin <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> allows the members <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to pivot relative to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the stem <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the catch <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> has a plurality of recesses <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> at the lower end which projects into the lower tubular member <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. For example, the stem <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> has three recesses <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, one of which is centrally disposed, with the others disposed symmetrically of the centrally disposed recess <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>, the catch <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> has a cylindrical base <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> with a through-bore <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to receive the rivet or pin <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>). The stem <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> has a reduced portion extending from the base <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and a reduced upper portion, as viewed. In addition, the stem <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> has a through-bore <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> for passage of the rivet or pin <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, the tilt mechanism <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> also has a pin <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, which is mounted in the lower tubular member <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> transversely of and in the centrally disposed recess <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the catch <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in order to lock the tubular members <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> relative to each other. The pin <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> has ends which extend through elongated slots <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> in the lower tubular section <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The pin <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is thus moveable relative to the catch <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in order to release the pin <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> from the recess <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the catch <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> A spring means <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is also disposed within the tubular member <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> for biasing the pin <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> towards the catch <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. As illustrated, the spring means <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is in the form of a coil spring that abuts the pin <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and which has an outside diameter slightly smaller than the inside diameter of the tubular member <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The opposite end of the spring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> seats on the wood pole section <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the upper tubular member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is provided with a small bore <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> to accommodate the pin <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>), as well as a pair of diametrically disposed bores <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) to receive a pin <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> or counter-bores <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>&prime; (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) to accommodate a rivet <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. As shown, the end surface <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of the tubular member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> has a circular radius. As indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the tubular member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> has a cylindrical bore <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to receive the wood pole section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, the lower tubular member <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> has a bore <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> to accommodate the pin <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>) and a pair of diametrically disposed bores <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) to receive a pin <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> or counter-bores <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>&prime; (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) to receive a rivet <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. Also, the upper end of the tubular member <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> has a rounded contour on a radius substantially equal to the radius of the surface of the upper tubular member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the pin <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is provided with a rounded head <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> on each end which projects through slots <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> in the tubular member <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to facilitate manual contact. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> When one desires to change the orientation of the upper section <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of an umbrella relative to the lower section <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, for example, from the aligned position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, to a tilted position, the exposed heads <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> of the pin <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are grasped by the thumb and index finger of the user and pushed downwardly. This retracts the pin <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> from within the centrally disposed recess <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the catch <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The upper section of the umbrella may then be manually tilted in one direction or the other until the stem <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the catch <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> abuts the inside of the lower section <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> preventing further movement. At this time, the pin <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is released so that the coil spring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> biases the pin <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> into the now-aligned offset recess <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> in the stem <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. This locks the tubular sections <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> relative to each other and the upper and lower sections of the umbrella relative to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> When one desires to change the tilt position of the umbrella, the rounded heads <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> of the pin <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are again pulled downwardly to release the pin <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> from the catch <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> so that the umbrella may be brought into an upright position with the tubular members <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> coaxially aligned, as indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> During tilting of the tubular members <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> relative to each other, the interfitting surfaces of the two members <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> minimize the risk of the fingers of the user being pinched therebetween. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, wherein like reference characters indicate like parts as above, the lower tubular member <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>&prime; may be modified for use with a hollow aluminum or other metal umbrella sections. To this end, the lower tubular section <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>&prime; has a reduced diameter portion <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> to receive a lower metal section of a pole thereon. Likewise, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the upper tubular member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>&prime; of the tilt mechanism may be provided with a reduced diameter portion <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> to receive an upper metal section of a pole thereon, for example, in a friction-fit manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In addition, the spring means <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> has a plate (not shown), e.g. in the form of a Bellville washer secured within the lower tubular member <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>&prime; in abutment with the bottom of the coil spring (not shown). In this respect, the plate is frictionally secured within and transversely of the tubular member <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>&prime;. The degree of the friction fit is such as to resist any tendency of the coil spring to force the plate from the fixed position within the tubular member <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The invention thus provides a tilt mechanism for an outdoor umbrella construction which is of relatively simple construction. Further, the invention provides a tilt mechanism which has substantially smooth interfitting surfaces between tilting sections thereof to avoid pinching a user&apos;s fingers or a hand. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The invention further provides a tilt mechanism of robust construction which can be easily manipulated to allow tilting of an upper section of an umbrella relative to a lower section. </paragraph>
