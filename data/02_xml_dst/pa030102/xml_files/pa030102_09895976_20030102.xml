<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A system and method for improved performance reviews is provided. Each employee has an employee profile data area that is used to store planning data and actual data corresponding to the employee. Planning data includes risk analysis data, compensation data, and development planning data. Actual data includes current compensation data and performance evaluation data. Tools are available to compare a selected employee with other employees based on the evaluations and planning data. Discrepancies between employees are rectified by adjusting evaluations or planning factors corresponding to one or more employees. Employee performance is also analyzed based on the contribution level of the employee and the planned rewards for the employee. Performance reviews can also be simultaneously reviewed by a group of managers that manage a group of employees. Data pertaining to employees can be changed by the employee&apos;s manager and the effect of the changes are displayed on each manager&apos;s display. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a system and method for managing human resources for an organization. More particularly, the present invention relates to a system and method for improving personnel performance reviews using multi-tiered management system overview. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Managers in modern business organizations have increasingly complex roles to perform in managing the various facets of the business organization. While managers differ greatly in the objectives and goals of their respective departments or areas, a key element that most managers deal with are the employees in their department or area and their efforts to retain a highly talented pool of employees while staying within given resource requirements, such as salary and stock budgets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Today managers and human resource leaders have limited information available for fairly reviewing employee performance, assessing the risk of individuals leaving the organization and identifying those individuals most likely to leave, fairly awarding salary increases and stock incentives based upon employee performance and the desire to retain more talented employees, and accurately comparing compensation received by the manager&apos;s employees with meaningful benchmarks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Many managers today react to problems, such as key talent leaving the organization, rather than engaging in pre-planning activities to identify situations that eventually lead to such problems. The reason for reacting, rather than planning, for employee issues is the difficulty of organizing and tracking many disparate pieces of data about employees. Managers are often provided with different reports regarding employees&apos; salaries, stock options, and other rewards. In separate paper or computer files the manager may keep records of employee performance reviews and the general trend of employees in terms of performance ratings. Managers are challenged, however, when comparing employees to benchmark averages or simply other employees in the same organization. Mid-level managers are often left to rely on immediate managers to fairly and accurately rate employee performances and reward the performances accordingly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> On an annual, or other periodic, basis managers review the employees performance and award salary increases, awards, and stock incentives to those individual employees deemed more critical to the organization. In large organizations, managers, especially mid-level managers, are challenged by the fact that employees are not rewarded similarly based in large part on the employees&apos; immediate manager. While some managers are able to obtain many awards and salary increases for many members of their department, other managers struggle to obtain marginal rewards for their better employees. This dichotomy in management treatment has almost as many reasons as there are managers. Some managers may feel that their employees are handsomely paid when, in actuality, the employees&apos; compensation is far below that of their peers. Other managers may try and keep costs in an area or department low in order to impress the manager&apos;s superiors. On the other side of the coin, managers may overly reward lower contribution to the organization in order to build a loyal team of employees or because the manager does not realize that the performance of his employees is generally less than that of other employees in the organization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> To address fairness issues, many organizations have management meetings to discuss the relative merit of employees being managed by a group of managers. These meetings often involve discussing many employees individually without clear comparisons between an employee and his or her peers. A mid-level, or project manager, often has difficulty in determining whether compensation and other awards are doled out fairly. Once again, the mid-level manager has little objective information at hand to determine whether inequities exist between employees. When a talented employee leaves the organization for a better opportunity elsewhere, it often is only discovered through discussions with the parting employee that the employee was being under compensated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Some awards, such as stock option awards, can be used as an incentive to retain an organization&apos;s most talented employees, especially those employees whose talents are highly marketable to other organizations. The stock options granted usually vest over some number of years making it financially advantageous to the employee to remain with the organization until the options vest. While stock options are often used to retain employees, the award of options is often not coupled with a risk assessment system that identifies those employees that are highly talented and, based on talents or individual employee factors, are at a high risk of leaving the organization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> If risk assessment concerning employee retention is even performed at most organizations, it is usually based solely on the manager&apos;s intuition or feeling regarding whether an employee will leave the organization. A list of employees that might choose to leave the company might be provided to upper management for consideration. However, once again it is difficult for mid-management to understand which of the employees identified as a &ldquo;flight risk&rdquo; is truly a high contributor, and which are marginal or poor contributors that simply complain to management that they might seek employment at another organization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Another challenge with traditional organizations is that human resources (HR) programs and assistance is not integrated with the particular functions, such as compensation planning, that are performed by managers. As such, these programs and guidelines are reviewed separately by managers and then applied later when the manager performs the various functions. Lack of understanding or attention to human resources programs leads to additional challenges when managers attempt to implement or use the HR programs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> What is needed, therefore, is a system and method to collect, manage, and analyze information regarding an organization&apos;s personnel in a complete and systematic way. It is desired that each level of management is integrated with the system along with human resources personnel in order to provide the various levels of management and human resources with the information needed by the particular individuals. A system and method for reviewing employee contributions is needed to adequately assess each employee&apos;s contribution in light of contributions made by his or her peers. A system and method is also needed for performing risk assessment and identifying those individuals making high contributions and with a higher risk of leaving the organization for another opportunity. A system and method is further needed to use the contribution and risk assessment data in planning employees&apos; compensation and other awards. A system and method is needed to facilitate management meetings in order to discuss employee contributions without revealing sensitive, or confidential, information pertaining to the individual members of the management team. Finally, a system and method is needed to provide for flexibility in management structure as well as addressing unplanned organizational events or data that needs to be tracked for individual employees. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> It has been discovered that a system and method, referred to as the People Planner System, addresses the aforementioned challenges with the prior art. In particular, the People Planner system collects, manages, and analyzes information regarding an organization&apos;s personnel in a complete and systematic way. A data store of employee data is managed and organized to provide various levels of data to various levels of management. Executive management receive strategic level data that apply to an entire organization. They also determine enterprise level salary data that is applied to lower levels of the organization. Lower levels of management view increasingly detailed information based on the particular level of management. In addition, human resources personnel are integrated with the People Planner in order to implement HR programs and provide various levels of management with guidance regarding employment issues. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Managers use People Planner to assess, or evaluate, employee contributions to the organization. The People Planner database retains the data so that it is accessible by the manager as well as upper levels of management. The manager is therefore able to refine or re-evaluate an employee while higher levels of management are able to determine whether the manager is fairly and adequately assessing employees. People Planner provides for various functions to be performed at various times with the data collected from those functions accumulating into a more complete planning picture regarding the employee. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> For example, a manager may enter evaluation data regarding the performance of employees. In addition, the manager may perform a risk analysis function for an employee using a risk analysis tool. The risk analysis tool uses actual (i.e., current) data about the employee to assist the manager in the risk assessment. The risk assessment data is stored by People Planner along with the current data. Compensation planning uses a tool that uses the actual data and the risk analysis data to assist the manager in planning the employee&apos;s compensation. Likewise, the stock planning tool uses the actual data, the risk planning data, and the compensation planning data to assist the manager in planning stock awards. The manager can also use development planning tools along with retention planning tools using the data available about the employee maintained by People Planner. Furthermore, additional programs or organizational events may be added to People Planner and the manager may select employees for the programs or events based upon considerations provided by HR or upper management. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In hybrid or matrix management organizations, an individual employee sometimes works for more than one manager. For example, an employee with a particular critical skill might be needed to work on three projects. Upper management may decide that the employee will spend 50% in the first department, 20% in the second department, and 30% in the third department. People Planner allows the three immediate managers to collaborate yet provide their own individual evaluations and compensation/stock planning data. An overall evaluation and compensation/stock award is then computed based on the inputs of the three managers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> People Planner facilitates management communication by providing managers with real-time snapshots of an organization without compromising the confidentiality of information of the managers involved in the discussions. For example, a project manager with three department managers reporting to her may want to meet with the three managers to discuss all the employees in the project manager&apos;s project. Normally the three department managers are able to view and alter the information for the employees that report to the respective managers. The project manager, however, is able to view the People Planner data for all the employees reporting to the three managers as well as salary and employment data for the three department managers. To analyze all the employees in the project collectively, the project manager can grant other employees, in this case the department managers, the ability to view the People Planner data available to the project manager. In addition, the project manager can select employee data to exclude from the project manager&apos;s view, in this case the data pertaining to the three department managers would be excluded so that the department managers do not see confidential salary and planning data that applies to their management peers. The management team can now look at the People Planner data maintained for the employees either in an online meeting with each manager viewing the same information or in a meeting room with a screen projection of the project manager&apos;s People Planner view. Changes made to employee data is seen by all managers in the team as well as analyses and information pertaining to the overall project. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> When planning data if finalized and approved it is used as the basis for employees&apos; actual data. In this way planning data becomes actual data at any time deemed appropriate, such as a date in the organization when compensation changes are instituted or when stock options are granted. Some prior planning data, such as compensation and stock options, is then cleared out in order to prepare for the next set of planning data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The foregoing is a summary and thus contains, by necessity, simplifications, generalizations, and omissions of detail; consequently, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the summary is illustrative only and is not intended to be in any way limiting. Other aspects, inventive features, and advantages of the present invention, as defined solely by the claims, will become apparent in the non-limiting detailed description set forth below. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The following is intended to provide a detailed description of an example of the invention and should not be taken to be limiting of the invention itself. Rather, any number of variations may fall within the scope of the invention which is defined in the claims following the description. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a high level diagram showing various layers of management using information managed and maintained by the People Planner System. Executive management <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> use People Planner System <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> to enter and view strategic employee data <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. For example, executive management <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may use People Planner System <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> to analyze potential skill deficits or receive rollup information regarding risk assessments. This information can be used by executive management <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to allocate additional resources to problem areas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Division management <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> use People Planner System <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> to enter and view division level employee data <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. Division management <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> use People Planner System <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> similarly to executive management <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> except with a focus on the particular division within the organization. Again, problem areas reported by managers in employee evaluations and risk assessments can be used to provide additional resources to projects and to alert executive management to potential problems. In addition, employee analyses can be performed at high levels such as division management <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and executive management <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to determine whether employees with similar talents and experience levels are compensated and awarded similarly. Anomalies, such as poor performing employees receiving large salary increases and high performing employees receiving little or no salary increases can be identified, analyzed, and likely corrected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Project managers <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> use People Planner System <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> to provide and view project level employee data <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>. Project managers, like division and executive managers, can view information about any employee (including managers) reporting to the project manager. While executive management and division management may focus more on spotting anomalies and analyzing summary data to identify potential problems, project managers may often view individual employee information, especially to determine whether employees are being compensated and rewarded consistently and fairly by the department managers. Project managers <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> may also hold management meetings where People Planner System data pertaining to the department managers is excluded so that the management team can focus on the employees within the project and determine whether the employees are being treated fairly or whether poorer performing employees in one department are being evaluated as higher contributors to higher performing employees in another department. Discrepancies such as these can be resolved dynamically by the project manager or one of the department manager changing employee data. The revised employee data can thereafter be viewed and discussed. The process of refining the People Planner System data continues until the management team is satisfied with the information pertaining to all employees in the project. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Department managers <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> (i.e., immediate managers, foremen, direct supervisors) use People Planner System <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> to enter and view department level employee data <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>. Department managers <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> use People Planner System <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> to evaluate employee performance, perform risk assessment, perform compensation and stock planning, complete or revise development plans for employees, perform retention plans for key employees identified as having executive potential or key technical potential, and provide additional data pertaining to employees that the manager wishes to attend HR programs or company events, such as special meetings, classes, or projects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Human resources personnel <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> use People Planner System to assist various levels of management with personnel related questions and use People Planner System to view and enter human resources data <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>. While assisting various levels of management, human resources <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> uses their skill and experience with analyzing employee data to aid management in making employee decisions and to assist managers in using People Planner System <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> to appropriately analyze the People Planner System information pertaining to the managers&apos; employees. Human resources <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> also uses People Planner System to include new programs and events that can be used by managers with their employees. In addition, human resources <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> may determine when certain People Planner System functions take place. For example human resources <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> may determine when planning data is finalized and used as a basis for current, or actual, data to reflect employees&apos; compensation changes, stock awards, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Computer network <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is used to connect the various managers to People Planner System <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. Computer network <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> may be a local area network (LAN), a Wide Area Network (WAN), a mainframe computer with connected terminals, or a virtual private network (VPN) implemented over a public network such as the Internet. Computer network <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> receives People Planner requests <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and passes the received requests to People Planner System <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. People Planner System <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> processes the request and maintains employee database <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> to store the data. In one embodiment, employee database <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> is a Lotus Notes&trade; database. In large organizations, employee data may be divided among several databases for performance and utilization reasons. In a distributed model, employee data for a particular area, such as a project or company location, may be located on the same database for improved maintenance of related employee records and improved lower level analyses. Higher level analyses use information summarized from the distributed databases in order to provide executive management <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and perhaps division management <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> strategic employee data <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and division level employee data <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. The People Planner System process request <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and prepares and returns responses <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> which is viewed on the manager&apos;s display screen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a hierarchy diagram showing resources, such as money used for salaries, being distributed and spread from high levels of the organization to lower levels of the organization. A limited amount of compensatory resources <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> are available to distribute to employees. The amount of compensatory resources <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> depends on the size and economic health of the organization. If fewer resources are available than in previous years, executive management <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> may be forced to lower salaries or reduce the number of employees through voluntary or involuntary measures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Executive management <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> determines how the available compensatory resources will be spread among the various high level divisions of the organization. In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, three division salary data are determined by executive management <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> (division salary data <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, division salary data <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, and division salary data <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>). The division salary data is written to budget files available to the division managers in the People Planner System. The People Planner System is used by executive management <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> to aid in the division salary determination by providing executive management <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> with current salary needs of the various divisions, summaries of the employees and locations of the various divisions, and risk analysis information pertaining to the various divisions. The risk analysis information may alert executive management <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> to a potential situation where key types of employees, such as those with sought after technical skills, are at risk of leaving the organization. This type of information may prompt executive management to allot more to divisions at risk so that such skilled employees can be better compensated to avoid potential attrition problems. In addition, the People Planner System includes projected or planning data that aids in determining appropriate percentages of increases that should be allocated to the various divisions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The division management, in turn, use the provided division salary data to determine how to spread the division compensatory amounts to areas, such as projects, within the division. In the example shown, division management <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> receives division salary data <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> from executive management. Division management <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> uses the People Planner System to allocate division salary data <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> to the various projects included in the division. Once again, the People Planner System is used to provide division management <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> with current salary needs of the various projects, summaries of the employees and locations of the various projects, and risk analysis information pertaining to the various projects. Division managers also use projected, or planning, data included in the People Planner System that was provided by lower levels of management. The People Planner System is used to distribute budget amounts to the various project managers. In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, division management <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> provides salary budgeting data to three projects. The budgeting data is provided to the projects through the People Planner System (project salary data <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Project management uses the allocated project salary data to provide budget data to the various departments that are included in the project. The project manager&apos;s determinations are made at a more micro- rather than macro-level with individual employees&apos; needs often used as a basis for the project manager&apos;s decisions. Again, the People Planner System is used to provide management, in this case project manager <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, with current salary needs of the employees, summaries of the employees and of the various departments, and risk analysis information pertaining to the various employees and projects. Project managers also use projected, or planning, data included in the People Planner System that was provided by immediate, or department, managers during prior planning cycles. The People Planner System is used to distribute budget amounts to the various department managers. In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, project manager <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> provides salary budgeting data to three departments using the People Planner System (department salary data <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Department managers receive budget data from their project managers and use the budget data to plan compensatory changes for individual employees in the department manager&apos;s department. In the example shown, department manager <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> receives department salary budget data <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>. The People Planner System is used to provide management, in this case department manager <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, with current salary needs of the employees in the department, summaries of the employees, and risk analysis information pertaining to the employees. Department manager <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> uses the People Planner System to plan compensatory changes and to record the planned changes in order for the department manager and higher levels of management to analyze the planned changes in light of the budget restraints. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The People Planner System is also used to move budget amounts between divisions, projects, and departments. For example, if a given department was initially allocated more money than deemed needed (for example, based on employee contributions and comparison of the employees&apos; current salaries with those of employees in other departments), money that was initially allocated to the department may be reallocated by the project manager to a department that was initially under-funded. This same &ldquo;give-and-take&rdquo; can be applied to higher levels of the organization with the People Planner System used to identify possible areas for re-allocation and facilitate the transfer of budget amounts from one area to another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a data layer diagram showing various layer components being created to form an employee profile and how planning data is used to generate actual employment data. Employee profile <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> includes actual and planning data corresponding to an employee. Actual data <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> includes information such as the employee&apos;s current salary and stock options that have been granted to the employee, the employee&apos;s current job title, level, and performance rating and any other information that the organization uses to track and assess employees. Actual data <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> may also include historical data, such as the employee&apos;s past salary levels, prior stock awards, and prior job titles, levels, and performance ratings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The manager performs risk analysis <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> using the employee&apos;s actual data do determine the employee&apos;s value to the organization and the risk of the employee leaving the organization for other opportunities (see FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for detailed descriptions of risk analysis using the People Planner System). The manager&apos;s risk analysis is provided to the People Planner System as risk planning data <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>. Employee profile <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> now has a richer set of data <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> for making further decisions regarding the employee&apos;s compensation and development. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Employee profile data <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> includes actual (or current) data as well as the risk planning data. This data is used by the manager in using the People Planner System&apos;s compensation planner <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. Based on the employee&apos;s actual data and the risk analysis data the manager is better equipped to plan changes to the employee&apos;s compensation. At this stage, compensation planning data <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> may simply identify the employee for a certain level of salary increase (i.e., significant increase, increase, cost of living increase, and no increase) it may actually plan a certain dollar-amount salary change for the employee. Compensation planning data <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> is used by the People Planner System to create an even richer set of data (<highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>) that now includes actual data, risk planning data, and compensation planning data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Employee profile data <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> is used by the People Planner System for the manager&apos;s stock planning <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>. Actual data, risk planning data, and compensation planning data aids in the determination of whether to plan to give the employee stock options and, if so, how many options to plan on giving to the employee. Risk planning data is usually important during stock option considerations because the options typically vest over a period years providing an incentive for employees that may be at risk for leaving to stay in the organization until their options vest. In addition, the value of prior stock option awards is also useful in making the determination because prior options that are &ldquo;under water&rdquo; (i.e., the price of the option is now greater than the current price of the stock) have less influence on employees who are considering leaving the organization. In these situations, it may be prudent to grant additional options at the new (lower) current stock price to provide additional incentives to retain the employee. Stock planning data <highlight><bold>355</bold></highlight> is added to employee profile <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> creating an even richer set of employee profile data (<highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Compensatory considerations often include both compensatory planning considerations (step <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>) as well as stock planning considerations (step <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>). The manager may go back and forth between various stages in order to refine the data and better assess the employee&apos;s risk of leaving and the right mix of salary increases and stock option awards. For example, for a contributing employee that is at risk of leaving the organization, the manager may first decide to give the employee a significant increase in salary. However the employee&apos;s risk of leaving may be viewed as more important that the employee&apos;s current contribution. As such, the manager may decide to plan on giving the employee a sizable number of options that vest over a number of years and lower the salary increase to a standard increase, perhaps in light of salary budget constraints. The manager may go back and forth several times between compensation planning <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> and stock option planning <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> for a given employee until the manager feel she has the right mix. For additional assistance, the manager can use the People Planner System to engage the advice and experience of human resources personnel who are trained to help managers evaluate and analyze employee situations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Employee profile <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> now includes employee data <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> which includes actual (current) employee data, risk planning data, compensation planning data, and stock planning data. Employee data <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> provides a picture for the manager to use in performing other activities such as development planning <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight>, retention planning <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight>, and identifying the employee for additional HR programs or organization events (<highlight><bold>382</bold></highlight>). Development planning <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> results in development planning data <highlight><bold>368</bold></highlight> which is added to the employee&apos;s profile data. Likewise, retention planning <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight> results in retention planning data <highlight><bold>378</bold></highlight> and additional planning <highlight><bold>382</bold></highlight> results in additional employee data <highlight><bold>386</bold></highlight> which are each added to the employee&apos;s profile data. Retention planning <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight> involves identifying employees with high potential early in the employee&apos;s career and establishing and tracking employee goals or milestones so that the full potential of such employees is realized by the organization (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> for more details regarding retention planning). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Employee profile data <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> now includes actual (current) data, risk planning data, compensation planning data, stock planning data, development planning data, retention planning data, and additional planning data providing a large snapshot of the employee, the employee&apos;s current contributions, opportunities and challenges associated with the employee, and near- and far-term plans for the employee&apos;s career with the organization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The data captured in employee profile <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is analyzed in management meetings and often refined in light of the employee&apos;s contribution and expected value in comparison with that of other employees. The salary and stock option planning may have only indicated that the organization planned to give the employee a &ldquo;significant increase&rdquo; or &ldquo;significant stock option award&rdquo; without specifying the actual dollar amount of the increase or the actual number of shares and vesting period for stock. In this case, the planned salary increase and stock option award are converted to actual dollar and stock figures in light of the salary and stock option budgets. The planned amounts are then made effective at a certain point in time during roll-over process <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> During roll-over process <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> certain planning items, such as compensation and stock planning figures are moved to the employee&apos;s actual (current) data. Other items such as the employee&apos;s evaluation rating are also moved from planning areas to the actual data area. Prior actual figures are moved to historical actual data areas in order to keep a record of the employee&apos;s prior salaries, stock options, and evaluations. Short term planning data areas, such as the salary planning area and the stock planning area are cleared in order to prepare for the next planning cycle. The new actual data is used in a production environment to generate paychecks with the employee&apos;s new salary level and to generate stock option data that is provided to employees for acceptance of the newly granted options and eventual exercise of such options. Long term planning data, such as risk analysis data, development planning data, and retention planning data are retained for further refinement in future planning cycles so that the planning efforts of the manager are not lost or forgotten. In addition, when an employee moves from one department to another department (or when a new manager is assigned to a department) the new manager uses the People Planner System to view the planning and actual data established by the manager&apos;s predecessor, thus aiding and smoothing the transition from one manager to the next. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a diagram showing a manager using the People Planner System to perform certain planning and analysis functions. People Planner Data <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> includes employee profiles <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and Human Resources program data <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> as well as other data. Employee profile data <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> includes planning factors <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> (such as risk planning data, salary and stock planning data, development planning data, etc.) corresponding to employees. Employee profile data <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> also includes actual data <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> (such as the current salary, stock option grants, evaluation rating, etc.) corresponding to employees. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Manager <highlight><bold>425</bold></highlight> uses various components of the People Planner System to make pre-planning requests <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> to pre-planning tool <highlight><bold>435</bold></highlight> included with the People Planner System. Pre-planning tool <highlight><bold>435</bold></highlight> reads HR program data <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> and employee profile data <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> alerting the manager of new human resources programs and identifying employees that, based on the HR program criteria, might be considered for various programs. Manager <highlight><bold>425</bold></highlight> may select one or more employees for the HR program and provide planning response <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> which is used by pre-planning tool <highlight><bold>435</bold></highlight> to retain the manager&apos;s selections in selected employee profiles <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> What-If Scenarios tool <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> is used by manager <highlight><bold>425</bold></highlight> to try various planning factors and explore the overall planning results without committing to the planning factors. For example, manager <highlight><bold>425</bold></highlight> may provide what-if request <highlight><bold>445</bold></highlight> to look at the department if everyone that is identified as being a high risk to leave the company was given a significant salary increase and an award of stock options. What-if results <highlight><bold>455</bold></highlight> would be returned to manager <highlight><bold>425</bold></highlight> by the what-if scenario tool and display the effect on the department. The manager may determine that too much of the salary budget would be used for these individuals and not leave enough for high contributing employees that are not at risk of leaving. Scenario tool <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> can be used repeatedly to help the manager gain an understanding of the effects of certain planning decisions. If manager <highlight><bold>425</bold></highlight> is satisfied with the scenario results, the planning factors used to create the results can be applied to employee profiles <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. In addition, HR personnel can share the manager&apos;s online view of such scenario results and provide guidance for refining the planning factors. If the what-if results are not acceptable by manager <highlight><bold>425</bold></highlight> then the planning factors used by the what-if tool can be discarded and not applied to employee profiles <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Employee analysis tool <highlight><bold>465</bold></highlight> is used by manager <highlight><bold>425</bold></highlight> to further analyze an individual employee or a group of employees included in employee profiles <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. Manager <highlight><bold>425</bold></highlight> provides employee requests <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight> to the employee analysis component of the People Planner System. Manager <highlight><bold>425</bold></highlight> uses employee analysis tool <highlight><bold>465</bold></highlight> to evaluate the contributions of the employee and determine whether the employee is a low or high contributor and whether a promotion should be planned for the employee. These determinations are provided in the manager&apos;s employee responses <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> that are used by employee analysis component <highlight><bold>465</bold></highlight> and retained in employee profile <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. The manager&apos;s employee responses <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> may identify employees as low or high contributors and may also assign an evaluation rating (i.e., &ldquo;A,&rdquo; &ldquo;B,&rdquo; &ldquo;C,&rdquo; etc.) to the employee (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> for further detail regarding employee evaluations using the People Planner System). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Risk assessment component <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> of the People Planner System is used by manager <highlight><bold>425</bold></highlight> to identify employees that are at risk of leaving the organization. Manager <highlight><bold>425</bold></highlight> provides risk requests <highlight><bold>475</bold></highlight> to risk assessment component <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> identifying one or more employees from employee profile <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. Risk assessment tool <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> assists the manager in evaluating risks concerning employees. Manager&apos;s risk responses regarding such employees is used by the risk assessment tool to update the employee&apos;s risk planning data maintained in the employee&apos;s employee profile <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> includes additional People Planner System tools used by managers to plan for employee salary changes, stock options, and other awards. People Planner Data <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> includes salary budget data <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>, available option data <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, employee profiles <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> and award budget data <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>. Salary budget data <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> includes available salary data that has been allocated to the manager&apos;s area or department. Likewise, available option data <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> includes stock options available for the manager to grant to one or more employees. Employee profile data <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> includes planning factors data <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight> and actual, or current, data <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight>. Award budget data <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> includes budgets for both monetary awards <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight> and non-monetary awards <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>. Non-monetary awards may include extra vacation days, admission to a special organizational event or program, lunch with an executive or the like. Manager <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> uses salary tool component <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> of the People Planner System to plan salary changes for employees. Salary input <highlight><bold>545</bold></highlight> includes the salary changes requested by the manager. Salary tool <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> updates the appropriate employee profile planning factors <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight> data for the selected employee. Salary tool <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> also provides manager <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> with updated salary planning data <highlight><bold>555</bold></highlight> comparing the manager&apos;s planning data for one or more employees with salary budget <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>. Salary tool <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> can also be used to compare employee&apos;s actual data <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight> and planning factors <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight> with organizational, regional, or national averages for people with similar skills and contribution levels. Salary tool <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> can also be used to analyze whether people are being compensated fairly. For example, salary tool <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> can aid the manager in identifying high contributors that are receiving small or no salary increases. On the other side, salary tool <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> can be used to identify low contributing employees that are planned to receive large or significant salary increases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Stock option tool <highlight><bold>565</bold></highlight> is a People Planner System component to aid manager <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> in identifying employees that should receive stock options. Stock option tool <highlight><bold>565</bold></highlight> reads the available stock option budget data <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> which includes the amount of options that are available for the manager&apos;s employees. Stock option tool <highlight><bold>565</bold></highlight> also reads employee profile data <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>, particularly planning factors data <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight> which includes risk planning data and contribution data corresponding to the employees. This information is used by manager <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> to determine whether the employee is a high contributor to the organization with critical skills and the flight risk the employee presents to the organization. Based on this analysis, manager <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> decides whether to plan to award the employee stock options and, if so, how many options to provide and the vesting period for the options (stock input <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight>). Updated stock data <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight> is provided from stock option tool <highlight><bold>565</bold></highlight> to manager <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> in response to stock option input <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight> provided by the manager.

<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a flowchart showing the People Planner System being used to evaluate the performance of employees. Processing commences at <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> whereupon the first employee is selected (step <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>) from department data <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight> stored in the People Planner System. The manager analyzes the employee on a variety of planning factors. A determination is made as to whether the employee is a top contributor for the organization (decision <highlight><bold>615</bold></highlight>). If the employee is a top contributor, decision <highlight><bold>615</bold></highlight> branches to &ldquo;yes&rdquo; branch <highlight><bold>618</bold></highlight> whereupon a flag is set in the employee&apos;s People Planner Data indicating that the employee is a top contributor (step <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight>). On the other hand, if the employee is not a top contributor, decision <highlight><bold>615</bold></highlight> branches to &ldquo;no&rdquo; branch <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight> whereupon another determination is made as to whether the employee is a low contributor (decision <highlight><bold>625</bold></highlight>). If the employee is a low contributor, decision <highlight><bold>625</bold></highlight> branches to &ldquo;yes&rdquo; branch <highlight><bold>628</bold></highlight> whereupon a flag is set in the employee&apos;s People Planner Data indicating that the employee is a low contributor (step <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight>). If neither flag is set (i.e. the low or high contributor flags) then the employee is deemed an average contributor to the organization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The next decisions deals with the amount of pay increase to plan on giving the employee. A determination is made as to whether the employee should receive a significant, or high, increase in salary (decision <highlight><bold>635</bold></highlight>). If the employee should receive a significant salary increase, decision <highlight><bold>635</bold></highlight> branches to &ldquo;yes&rdquo; branch <highlight><bold>638</bold></highlight> whereupon a flag is set in the employee&apos;s People Planner Data indicating that the employee should receive a significant salary increase (step <highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight>). On the other hand, if the employee should not receive a significant salary increase, decision <highlight><bold>635</bold></highlight> branches to &ldquo;no&rdquo; branch <highlight><bold>642</bold></highlight> whereupon another determination is made as to whether the employee should receive no increase, or perhaps a salary reduction (decision <highlight><bold>645</bold></highlight>). If the employee should receive no increase, or perhaps a salary reduction, decision <highlight><bold>645</bold></highlight> branches to &ldquo;yes&rdquo; branch <highlight><bold>648</bold></highlight> whereupon a flag is set in the employee&apos;s People Planner Data indicating that the employee should receive no increase, or perhaps a salary reduction (step <highlight><bold>650</bold></highlight>). If neither flag is set (i.e. the significant increase or no increase flags) then the employee is planned to receive a normal salary increase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> A determination is made, based factors such as the employee&apos;s contribution to the organization, current level, and time spent at the current level, as to whether the employee should be promoted during the next cycle of promotions (decision <highlight><bold>660</bold></highlight>). A higher level position often means greater potential salary and stock option awards. If the manager determines that the employee should be promoted based on various factors, decision <highlight><bold>660</bold></highlight> branches to &ldquo;yes&rdquo; branch <highlight><bold>662</bold></highlight> whereupon a flag is set in the employee&apos;s People Planner Data indicating that the employee should be promoted (step <highlight><bold>685</bold></highlight>). On the other hand, if the manager does not decide that the employee should be promoted, decision <highlight><bold>660</bold></highlight> branches to &ldquo;no&rdquo; branch <highlight><bold>668</bold></highlight> bypassing the promotion setting step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> A determination is made, based factors such as the employee&apos;s skills, experience, contribution, and risk of the employee leaving the organization, as to whether the employee should receive stock options (decision <highlight><bold>670</bold></highlight>). An employee with critical skills which are marketable to other competing organizations often receive stock options to provide an incentive for such employees to remain with the organization for the amount of time it takes for the options to vest. If the manager determines that the employee should receive stock options, decision <highlight><bold>660</bold></highlight> branches to &ldquo;yes&rdquo; branch <highlight><bold>662</bold></highlight> whereupon a flag is set in the employee&apos;s People Planner Data indicating that the employee should receive stock options (step <highlight><bold>675</bold></highlight>).

This looping continues until all employees have been evaluated, at which time decision <highlight><bold>680</bold></highlight> branches to &ldquo;no&rdquo; branch <highlight><bold>688</bold></highlight> whereupon processing ends at <highlight><bold>695</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a flowchart showing a manager identifying employees&apos; motivators and inhibitors and the People Planner System used to determine flight risks of individual employees. Processing commences at <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> whereupon the first employee is selected (step <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight>) from department data <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> stored in the People Planner System. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The manager selects the first motivator for the selected employee (step <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>). As the name implies, motivators are factors that motivate the selected employee in his or her job. Examples of motivators include autonomy, base salary, communication, decision making authority, degree of challenge, geographic location, immediate management, monetary recognition, and opportunity for advancement. By the manager&apos;s understanding of the employee&apos;s likes and dislikes and from discussions or feedback received from the employee, the manager determines what motivates the employee and what inhibits, or hinders, the employee. If the selected employee is motivated by autonomy, the manager selects autonomy as a motivator and then applies a weight, or level of importance, to the motivator (step <highlight><bold>715</bold></highlight>). If an employee is greatly motivated by autonomy, a greater weight is applied to the motivator. The motivator and corresponding weight are saved in the employee&apos;s People Planner Data for future use in calculating the employee&apos;s flight risk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> A determination is made as to whether there are other motivators corresponding to the employee (decision <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight>).

This looping continues until there are no more motivators to apply to the employee at which time decision <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight> branches to &ldquo;no&rdquo; branch <highlight><bold>728</bold></highlight> whereupon the process repeats for identifying inhibitors that apply to the employee. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The manager selects the first inhibitor for the selected employee (step <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight>)). As the name implies, inhibitors are factors that inhibit the selected employee in his or her job. Examples of inhibitors include autonomy, base salary, communication, decision making authority, degree of challenge, geographic location, immediate management, monetary recognition, and opportunity for advancement. By the manager&apos;s understanding of the employee&apos;s likes and dislikes and from discussions or feedback received from the employee, the manager determines what inhibits, or hinders, the employee. If the selected employee is inhibited by opportunity for advancement, the manager selects opportunity for advancement as a inhibitor and then applies a weight, or level of importance, to the inhibitor (step <highlight><bold>735</bold></highlight>). If an employee is greatly inhibited by opportunity for advancement, a greater weight is applied to the inhibitor. The inhibitor and corresponding weight are saved in the employee&apos;s People Planner Data for future use in calculating the employee&apos;s flight risk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> A determination is made as to whether there are other inhibitors corresponding to the employee (decision <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight>). If there are more inhibitors, decision <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight> branches to &ldquo;yes&rdquo; branch <highlight><bold>742</bold></highlight> whereupon the next inhibitor is selected (step <highlight><bold>745</bold></highlight>) and a weight is applied (step <highlight><bold>735</bold></highlight>). This looping continues until there are no more inhibitors to apply to the employee at which time decision <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight> branches to &ldquo;no&rdquo; branch <highlight><bold>748</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The employee&apos;s flight risk is calculated (step <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight>) after the employee&apos;s motivators and inhibitors have been identified and weighed. The calculation may be performed by the manager by displaying the list of the employee motivators and inhibitors arranged by weighted value and providing the manager with employee data, such as salary data and job descriptions, to aid the manager in determining a flight risk value by comparing and contrasting the employee&apos;s motivators and inhibitors with the employees current circumstances. The flight risk calculation can also be computed using historical modeling data to compare the employee&apos;s motivators, inhibitors, and current job situation with other that have left the company. A strong similarity between the employee&apos;s profile and employees that left the organization results in a higher flight risk, while a weaker similarity results in a correspondingly lower flight risk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> A determination is made as to whether there are more employees for which the manager needs to assess risk (decision <highlight><bold>760</bold></highlight>).

<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The employee&apos;s contribution level is assigned (step <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight>). In one embodiment, the employee&apos;s contribution level is assigned by performing an employee evaluation process integrated with the People Planner System, such as the process described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. The employee&apos;s flight risk is also assigned (step <highlight><bold>825</bold></highlight>).

<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Determinations are made based on the employee&apos;s contribution level and flight risk in order to assign a &ldquo;risk quadrant&rdquo; to the employee. Risk quadrants therefore include: employees with low contribution to the organization and high risk to leave the organization (quadrant &ldquo;A&rdquo;), employees with high contribution to the organization and high risk to leave the organization (quadrant &ldquo;B&rdquo;), employees with high contribution to the organization and low risk to leave the organization (quadrant &ldquo;C&rdquo;), and employees with low contribution to the organization and low risk to leave the organization (quadrant &ldquo;D&rdquo;). Grouping employees into risk quadrants aids management, especially upper management, in analyzing large groups of employees, such as a site location, and determining whether future attrition problems are likely based on the percentage of employees in quadrant &ldquo;A&rdquo; and especially quadrant &ldquo;B.&rdquo; If problem areas exist, management can analyze employees in a given quadrant to determine if common inhibitors or motivators exist that can be used to encourage employees to remain with the organization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> A determination is made as to whether the selected employee&apos;s contribution to the organization is &ldquo;high&rdquo; (decision <highlight><bold>830</bold></highlight>). If the manager indicates that the selected employee&apos;s contribution is high, decision <highlight><bold>830</bold></highlight> branches to &ldquo;yes&rdquo; branch <highlight><bold>832</bold></highlight> whereupon a decision is made as to whether, based on the employee&apos;s inhibitors and motivators, the employee presents a flight risk to the organization (decision <highlight><bold>835</bold></highlight>). If the employee presents a flight risk, decision <highlight><bold>835</bold></highlight> branches to &ldquo;yes&rdquo; branch <highlight><bold>838</bold></highlight> whereupon the employee is assigned (step <highlight><bold>840</bold></highlight>) to quadrant &ldquo;B&rdquo; indicating a high contributor presenting a high flight risk to the organization. On the other hand, if the employee does not present a flight risk, decision <highlight><bold>835</bold></highlight> branches to &ldquo;no&rdquo; branch <highlight><bold>842</bold></highlight> whereupon the employee is assigned (step <highlight><bold>845</bold></highlight>) to quadrant &ldquo;C&rdquo; indicating a high contributor presenting a low flight risk to the organization. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is a flowchart used to analyze risk quadrants and act upon identified employees. Processing commences at <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> whereupon the first risk quadrant (i.e. Quadrant &ldquo;A&rdquo;) is selected (step <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight>). The selected quadrant is displayed to the manager (step <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight>, see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, screen <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> for an example quadrant view). The manager analyzes the risk quadrant data to determine whether changes are needed (step <highlight><bold>1025</bold></highlight>, see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, screen <highlight><bold>990</bold></highlight> for an example of analyzing risk quadrants). Risk quadrants can be analyzed down to viewing the group of employees that are included in a particular risk quadrant. A determination is made by the manager is changes are needed to any employees within the currently viewed risk quadrant (decision <highlight><bold>1025</bold></highlight>). If changes are needed, decision <highlight><bold>1025</bold></highlight> branches to &ldquo;yes&rdquo; branch <highlight><bold>1028</bold></highlight> whereupon an employee in the risk quadrant is selected (step <highlight><bold>1030</bold></highlight>). A determination is made as to whether changes are needed to the employee&apos;s incentives (decision <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight>). If changes are needed to the selected employee&apos;s incentives, decision <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> branches to &ldquo;yes&rdquo; branch <highlight><bold>1048</bold></highlight> whereupon the manager makes changes to the employee&apos;s planned nomination for stock options or other non-monetary award incentives designed to retain employees (step <highlight><bold>1048</bold></highlight>). If changes are not needed to the selected employee&apos;s incentives, decision <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> branches to &ldquo;no&rdquo; branch <highlight><bold>1058</bold></highlight> bypassing changes to the employee&apos;s stock options and non-monetary awards. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Another determination is made as to whether to edit the employee data, such as risk planning data (decision <highlight><bold>1060</bold></highlight>). This determination may be in light of seeing the employee in a quadrant that does not match manager&apos;s knowledge of the employee or in light of new information learned about the employee&apos;s inhibitors or motivators. In addition, this decision might be made because of a recent or dramatic change in the employee&apos;s contribution or value to the organization based on newly acquired skills or experiences. If changes are needed to the employee&apos;s People Planner Data, decision <highlight><bold>1060</bold></highlight> branches to &ldquo;yes&rdquo; branch <highlight><bold>1068</bold></highlight> whereupon the manager edits one or more employee planning factors (step <highlight><bold>1070</bold></highlight>). On the other hand, if the manager does not need to edit the employee&apos;s planning factors, decision <highlight><bold>1060</bold></highlight> branches to &ldquo;no&rdquo; branch <highlight><bold>1072</bold></highlight> bypassing the edit employee planning factors step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> After changes are made to the selected employee the quadrant data view is updated to reflect the changed information (step <highlight><bold>1075</bold></highlight>) and processing returns (loop <highlight><bold>1078</bold></highlight>) to view the quadrant information.

Top contributing employees often have critical skills that make them valuable, and therefore high contributors, to the organization. This selection helps management analyze why an employee has been identified as a top contributor without critical skills. It may be that the employee&apos;s critical skills were not noted or that the employee was incorrectly identified as a top contributor. In some cases, it may simply be that an employee without critical skills is a top contributor because of the employee&apos;s work ethic and ability to handle more tasks in a high quality manner. The selected employees are displayed to the manager (step <highlight><bold>1110</bold></highlight>). The manager views the selected employees and can view detailed data regarding the employees. A determination is made as to whether an employee&apos;s data in the People Planner System needs to be changed in light of the displayed data (decision <highlight><bold>1115</bold></highlight>). If an employee&apos;s data needs to be changed, decision <highlight><bold>1115</bold></highlight> branches to &ldquo;yes&rdquo; branch <highlight><bold>1118</bold></highlight> whereupon an employee is selected and data pertaining to the employee is changed (step <highlight><bold>1120</bold></highlight>) and processing loops back to re-analyze the group in light of the changed data.

Top contributing employees need to be rewarded for their efforts. In some cases, analysis of an employee in this group may reveal an employee that, for some reason, is currently overpaid in light of the employee&apos;s position, job title, and level and therefore does not require a significant salary increase. In other cases, an oversight may have occurred in not planning significant salary increases for top contributing employees. The selected employees are displayed to the manager (step <highlight><bold>1150</bold></highlight>). The manager views the selected employees and can view detailed data regarding the employees. A determination is made as to whether an employee&apos;s data in the People Planner System needs to be changed in light of the displayed data (decision <highlight><bold>1155</bold></highlight>).

Top contributing employees need to be rewarded for their efforts and stock options present an incentive for such top contributing employees to remain at the company. In some cases, analysis of an employee in this group may reveal an employee that does not warrant a stock option grant. For example, an high contributing employee with little flight risk may prefer awards and greater salary increases instead of stock options. In other cases, an oversight may have occurred in not planning stock option awards for top contributing employees. The selected employees are displayed to the manager (step <highlight><bold>1170</bold></highlight>). The manager views the selected employees and can view detailed data regarding the employees.

Low contributing employees often do not have critical skills. This selection helps management analyze why an employee has been identified as a low contributor with critical skills. It may be that the employee&apos;s critical skills were incorrectly noted or that the employee was incorrectly identified as a low contributor. In some cases, it may simply be that an employee with critical skills is a low contributor because of the employee&apos;s work ethic or attitude and inability to handle tasks in a quality manner.

<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Another selection identifies employees identified as low contributing employees that are receiving a significant pay increase (step <highlight><bold>1225</bold></highlight>). Low contributing employees typically are not rewarded as handsomely as higher contributing employees. In some cases, analysis of an employee in this group may reveal a low contributing employee that, for some reason, is currently underpaid in light of the employee&apos;s position, job title, and level and therefore requires a significant salary increase. In other cases, an oversight may have occurred in planning significant salary increases for low contributing employees. The selected employees are displayed to the manager (step <highlight><bold>1230</bold></highlight>). The manager views the selected employees and can view detailed data regarding the employees.

From prior People Planner System processes, the employee should already have a job level and job title, however if the employee is new or otherwise does not have a level and job title this data is supplied to the People Planner System and stored in the employee&apos;s People Planner Data area (step <highlight><bold>1320</bold></highlight>). In addition, compensation levels should already be set for the employee&apos;s current compensation and salary planning data for the employee&apos;s next pay increase may already be stored in the People Planner System.

People Planner Data for all employees within a particular group, such as a project or department, are selected from the People Planner Data (step <highlight><bold>1420</bold></highlight>). The first employee from the selected group is selected (step <highlight><bold>1425</bold></highlight>). The counters for planned pay increases, stock options, promotions and awards are accumulated by adding the current value of such counters to the planned pay increase, planned stock option grant, planned promotion, and planned awards for the currently selected employee (step <highlight><bold>1430</bold></highlight>). A determination is made as to whether more employees exist in the group to be processed (decision <highlight><bold>1440</bold></highlight>).

A determination is made as to whether the selected employee is a technical employee or identified as a potential executive candidate (decision <highlight><bold>1520</bold></highlight>). If the employee is identified as a possible key technical employee, decision <highlight><bold>1520</bold></highlight> branches to &ldquo;yes&rdquo; branch <highlight><bold>1528</bold></highlight> whereupon the employee&apos;s technical experience is identified and stored in the People Planner System (step <highlight><bold>1530</bold></highlight>). On the other hand, if the employee is identified as a potential executive candidate, decision <highlight><bold>1520</bold></highlight> branches to &ldquo;no&rdquo; branch <highlight><bold>1522</bold></highlight> whereupon the employee&apos;s skill and areas of expertise are identified (step <highlight><bold>1525</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> The next career goal for the selected employee is identified (step <highlight><bold>1540</bold></highlight>) along with the expected amount of time planned for the employee to achieve the next goal (step <highlight><bold>1545</bold></highlight>). The employee&apos;s ultimate goal (i.e., &ldquo;Chief Technical Architect,&rdquo; &ldquo;Division Vice President,&rdquo; etc.) is identified (step <highlight><bold>1550</bold></highlight>) along with the expected amount of time planned for the employee to achieve the ultimate goal (step <highlight><bold>1555</bold></highlight>). A mentor, such as an experienced employee in the organization, is identified for the employee (step <highlight><bold>1560</bold></highlight>). In addition, special certification or training planned for the employee to reach the goals is identified (step <highlight><bold>1570</bold></highlight>) along with any additional comments regarding the employee&apos;s potential.

<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> is a flowchart showing tracking of additional keywords by the People Planner System to track organizational events and reporting on employees based on the additional keywords. Keywords can be added to the People Planner System to track data such as employees attending an important conference, employees selected for a special organizational retreat, employees nominated for special awards, or any other number of items that the organization wishes to track for employees. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Processing commences at <highlight><bold>1600</bold></highlight> whereupon an administrator defines one or more keywords in the People Planner System (step <highlight><bold>1610</bold></highlight>). The People Planner System includes a notice area where notices about new keywords and other People Planner System changes are disseminated to management. An email message or the People Planner System notice area is used to inform management of the new keywords (step <highlight><bold>1620</bold></highlight>). Management selects an employee for one of the newly defined keywords (step <highlight><bold>1625</bold></highlight>). The keyword is set, or flagged, in the People Planner Data corresponding to the selected employee (step <highlight><bold>1630</bold></highlight>). A determination is made as to whether more employees should be selected for the newly added keyword (decision <highlight><bold>1640</bold></highlight>). This determination can be made over an amount of time and may be made by several different managers when analyzing their employees. If more employees should be selected for the keyword, decision <highlight><bold>1640</bold></highlight> branches to &ldquo;yes&rdquo; branch <highlight><bold>1645</bold></highlight> whereupon the next employee is selected for the keyword (step <highlight><bold>1650</bold></highlight>) and processing loops back to set the keyword in the People Planner Data corresponding to the selected employee. This looping continues until no more employees are selected for the keyword whereupon decision <highlight><bold>1640</bold></highlight> branches to &ldquo;no&rdquo; branch <highlight><bold>1655</bold></highlight>. Depending on the keyword a deadline may be established for a keyword so that employees are identified for the keyword before the deadline. For example, to prepare for a conference, a deadline typically exists for registering for the conference. At some point, a People Planner System administrator selects all employees that were selected for a particular keyword and reports or special processing takes place with the selected employees (step <highlight><bold>1660</bold></highlight>). For example, if the keyword corresponds to a conference, the People Planner System would process the selected employees and send registrations for each employee to the conference coordinators. A determination is made as to whether the keyword corresponds to a one time event or an ongoing activity or event (decision <highlight><bold>1670</bold></highlight>). If the keyword does not correspond to a one time event, decision <highlight><bold>1670</bold></highlight> branches to &ldquo;no&rdquo; branch <highlight><bold>1672</bold></highlight> bypassing the release of keyword space from the People Planner System. On the other hand, if the keyword corresponds to a one time event, decision <highlight><bold>1670</bold></highlight> branches to &ldquo;yes&rdquo; branch <highlight><bold>1678</bold></highlight> whereupon a People Planner System administrator retains a copy of a report or data file with the employees selected for the keyword (step <highlight><bold>1680</bold></highlight>) and the administrator releases the data space used to store the keyword data so that it can be used for other keywords (step <highlight><bold>1690</bold></highlight>). Keyword processing thereafter ends at <highlight><bold>1695</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

Processing commences at <highlight><bold>1750</bold></highlight> whereupon the first manager evaluates the employee and provides salary increase, stock award, award, and evaluation ratings for the employee. The manager&apos;s evaluation is multiplied (step <highlight><bold>1760</bold></highlight>) by a multiplier corresponding to the amount of work the employee performs for the manager (i.e. the work percentage discussed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). Likewise, the manager&apos;s planning of the employee&apos;s pay increase is computed (step <highlight><bold>1765</bold></highlight>), along with a stock award computation (step <highlight><bold>1770</bold></highlight>), and an awards computation (step <highlight><bold>1775</bold></highlight>). A determination is made as to whether additional managers need to evaluate the employee (decision <highlight><bold>1780</bold></highlight>). If additional managers need to evaluate the employee, decision <highlight><bold>1780</bold></highlight> branches to &ldquo;yes&rdquo; branch <highlight><bold>1782</bold></highlight> whereupon the next manager evaluates the employee (step <highlight><bold>1785</bold></highlight>) and processing loops back to multiply the next manager&apos;s evaluations and preplanning data with the multiplier corresponding to the manager. When all managers that manage the employee have performed evaluations, decision <highlight><bold>1780</bold></highlight> branches to &ldquo;no&rdquo; branch <highlight><bold>1788</bold></highlight> whereupon the employees total evaluation, salary increase, stock award, and other awards is computed by adding the various factors computed for each manager (step <highlight><bold>1790</bold></highlight>). The People Planner System can also facilitate communication between managers that each manage a given employee so that a fair assessment of the employee&apos;s contributions can be made in light of the employee&apos;s efforts and complexity involved in working in multiple areas. </paragraph>

Instead, project manager <highlight><bold>1800</bold></highlight> can &ldquo;exclude&rdquo; the department managers from her view of people planner data to allow the management team to analyze the employee planning factors and evaluations without showing information regarding the department managers. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>shows high level exclusion processing and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> shows detailed processing involved with setting up shared views and excluding certain employees from the viewed information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is a diagram showing managers being excluded from a higher-level People Planner View. The project manager&apos;s normal view (<highlight><bold>1850</bold></highlight>) lists employees reporting to the project manager from the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>including three department managers and nine employees reporting to the department managers. Exclude managers process <highlight><bold>1855</bold></highlight> is performed to create a new project managers view (<highlight><bold>1860</bold></highlight>) which lists the employees without listing the department managers. A granting process (<highlight><bold>1865</bold></highlight>) allows the project manager to share the new project manager&apos;s view (<highlight><bold>1860</bold></highlight>) with the department managers. The result is a shared project manager&apos;s view (<highlight><bold>1870</bold></highlight>) viewable by the project manager (<highlight><bold>1875</bold></highlight>), department manager A (<highlight><bold>1880</bold></highlight>), department manager B (<highlight><bold>1885</bold></highlight>), and department manager C (<highlight><bold>1890</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> is a flowchart showing employees being selected and removed from a particular People Planner System view. Processing commences at <highlight><bold>1900</bold></highlight> whereupon a list of all reporting employees is displayed on the manager&apos;s display device (step <highlight><bold>1905</bold></highlight>). The project (or higher level) manager selects the first employee (such as a reporting manager) to excluded from a new view (step <highlight><bold>1910</bold></highlight>). The People Planner Data associated with the selected employee is excluded from the new view (step <highlight><bold>1915</bold></highlight>). A determination is made as to whether the manager wants to exclude more employees (such as the department managers) from the new view (decision <highlight><bold>1920</bold></highlight>). If the manager wishes to exclude more employees, decision <highlight><bold>1920</bold></highlight> branches to &ldquo;yes&rdquo; branch <highlight><bold>1925</bold></highlight> whereupon the next employee (i.e., the next department manager) is selected (step <highlight><bold>1930</bold></highlight>) and processing loops back to excluded the selected employee from the new view. This looping continues until there are no more exclusion to process, at which time decision <highlight><bold>1920</bold></highlight> branches to &ldquo;no&rdquo; branch <highlight><bold>1935</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> A determination is made as to whether the manager wishes to save the new view or revise the manager&apos;s current view (decision <highlight><bold>1940</bold></highlight>). If the manager wishes to create a new view, decision <highlight><bold>1940</bold></highlight> branches to &ldquo;yes&rdquo; branch <highlight><bold>1945</bold></highlight> whereupon the manager provides a new view name to identify the view (step <highlight><bold>1950</bold></highlight>) and the new view is saved using the new view name (step <highlight><bold>1955</bold></highlight>). On the other hand, if the manager simply wants to revise her current view, decision <highlight><bold>1940</bold></highlight> branches to &ldquo;no&rdquo; branch <highlight><bold>1960</bold></highlight> whereupon the revised view is saved (step <highlight><bold>1965</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> The employees granted access to the view will often be the employees whose People Planner Data has been excluded from the view. The excluded employees can automatically be granted access to the new view or the project manager can select employees individually. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> The manager selects a first employee (i.e., a department manager) to grant access to the new or revised view (step <highlight><bold>1970</bold></highlight>). The selected employee is granted access to the new or revised view (step <highlight><bold>1975</bold></highlight>). A determination is made as to whether additional grants need to be given for the new or revised view (decision <highlight><bold>1980</bold></highlight>). If more grants need to be given, decision <highlight><bold>1980</bold></highlight> branches to &ldquo;yes&rdquo; branch <highlight><bold>1985</bold></highlight> whereupon the next employee is selected for granting access to the new or revised view (step <highlight><bold>1990</bold></highlight>) and processing loops back to grant the selected employee access to the view. This looping continues until there are no more employees that need access to the view, at which time decision <highlight><bold>1980</bold></highlight> branches to &ldquo;no&rdquo; branch <highlight><bold>1992</bold></highlight> and processing ends at <highlight><bold>1995</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
