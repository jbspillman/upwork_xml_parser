<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to the art of optical micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) devices, and more particularly, to all-optical switching using MEMS devices. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> One solution for all-optical switching employs two MEMS devices each containing an array of tiltable micro mirrors, e.g., small mirrors, which can reflect light, which herein refers to any radiation in the wavelength of interest, whether or not in the visible spectrum. An optical path is established for light supplied from an input source, e.g., an optical fiber, to an output, e.g., an output fiber, by steering the light using a first micro mirror on the first optical MEMS device, the first micro mirror being associated with the input fiber, onto a second micro mirror on the second optical MEMS device which is associated with the output fiber. The second micro mirror then steers the light into the output fiber. Each fiber connected to the system is considered a port of the system, the input fibers being the input ports and the output fibers being the output ports. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A problem in the art of all-optical switching using MEMS devices is that in order to increase number of ports in the system, i.e., the number of fibers, it has been necessary to increase the number of micro mirrors employed to perform the switching function. In the prior art, as noted above, the first optical MEMS device contained all of the first micro mirrors integrated thereon and the second optical MEMS device contained all of the second micro mirrors integrated thereon. Since the size of the optical MEMS device is a direct function of the number of micro mirrors on the optical MEMS device, and the number of micro mirrors required is directly proportional to the maximum number of ports available in the all-optical switch, to increase the maximum number of ports available in the all-optical switch requires one to employ a larger optical MEMS device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Unfortunately, limitations on manufacturing capability and the large package size have effectively limited the optical MEMS device at the present time to 1296 micro mirrors. Furthermore, even if the size of the micro mirrors could be effectively shrunk, there is still a problem in that control signals need to be brought to each micro mirror. The routing of these control signals consumes large amounts of space on the optical MEMS device, which would thus result in the optical MEMS device being very large. Additionally, there are control signals for each micro mirror that must be brought to the optical MEMS device from off of its substrate. In order to make these connections, additional large amounts of space is required on the optical MEMS device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> As a result of all these space requirements, the optical MEMS chip is quite large, and so, due to the manufacturing capability limits, the number of micro mirrors that can be placed on a single optical MEMS device is limited. The limitation on the number of micro mirrors, in turn, limits the number of ports of an all-optical switch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the micro mirrors presently available have a limited effective range through which they can be tilted. The limitation on the effective range further limits the number of ports that can be implemented in an all-optical switch employing such optical MEMS devices because each micro mirror on the first optical MEMS device must be able to direct the light incident on it to each of the micro mirrors on the second optical MEMS device. The ability to so direct the light is a function of the effective tilt range of the micro mirrors. In other words, greater effective tilt angle allows each micro mirror to direct its light over a greater area. For optical MEMS devices arranged as an optical switch, the greatest tilt angle required is for connections between micro mirrors in the opposing corners of the optical MEMS devices. For example, the most tilt is required by a micro mirror at the top right of the first MEMS device which must direct its light to a micro mirror at the bottom left of the second MEMS device. Thus, the size of the micro mirror array that can be employed in an optical switch is limited by the effective tilt range of its optical MEMS devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Increasing the separation distance between the two optical MEMS devices decreases the required tilt angle, which would allow the use of larger micro mirror arrays without changing the effective tilt range of the micro mirrors. Doing so, however, increases the beam diffraction, which, disadvantageously, requires the use of a micro mirror with a larger diameter or results in a loss of some of the light. Since using a larger micro mirror requires additional space, doing so increases the distance between the micro mirrors on the optical MEMS device, which further increases the size of the optical MEMS device for the same number of micro mirrors. As a result of increasing the size of the optical MEMS device, a greater tilt angle is required to couple the opposing corners of the opposing optical MEMS devices. Thus, essentially, additional separation of the opposing optical MEMS devices does not help to increase the number of ports due to the limited available tilt angle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Additionally, because the package of the MEMS device is considerably larger than the area thereof that contains the micro mirrors, it is not possible with current designs to place the micro mirror areas of multiple MEMS devices directly adjacent to one another to form a single, composite, larger MEMS device. Nor does it seem likely that future designs will facilitate doing so due to the need for a large edge area on the MEMS device to make the multitude of connections that are required. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> We have recognized that the limitations on the number of ports in an all-optical switch due to the constraints on the size and/or effective tilt range of the optical MEMS devices can be overcome, in accordance with the principles of the invention, by imaging one or more optical MEMS devices using an imaging system in combination with an actual other optical MEMS device, or an image thereof, to form a single virtual optical MEMS device that has the size of each of the optical MEMS devices combined. The physical size of the arrangement may be reduced by compacting the optical path, e.g., using appropriate conventional mirrors, and/or employing folded arrangements, i.e., arrangements in which there is only one MEMS device stage that does double duty for both input and output through the use of at least one conventional mirror. In one embodiment of the invention, the imaging system reproduces the angle of reflection of the light from the micro mirror. This may be achieved using a telecentric system, also known as a 4 f system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In various embodiments of the invention, in order to combine the images and/or actual devices of multiple optical MEMS devices, the imaging systems may be at different angles to each other, and it may also be required that the lenses of the imaging system that are optically furthest from the micro mirror overlap each other. To compensate for such different angles and overlapping, in one embodiment of the invention, a prism may be inserted for each image of an optical MEMS device at the plane in which its image is formed. The prism is designed to tilt all the angles of the light for an optical MEMS device opposite to the angle between the lens of the imaging system for that optical MEMS device that is furthest from that optical MEMS device and at least the lens of the imaging system of one other optical MEMS device that is furthest from that other optical MEMS device. In another embodiment of the invention, a lens may be employed in lieu of a prism to perform the same function. In yet another embodiment of the invention, folding mirrors may be similarly employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The overall system is arranged to account for inversion of any images of the MEMS devices by the imaging systems employed.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The following merely illustrates the principles of the invention. It will thus be appreciated that those skilled in the art will be able to devise various arrangements which, although not explicitly described or shown herein, embody the principles of the invention and are included within its spirit and scope. Furthermore, all examples and conditional language recited herein are principally intended expressly to be only for pedagogical purposes to aid the reader in understanding the principles of the invention and the concepts contributed by the inventor(s) to furthering the art, and are to be construed as being without limitation to such specifically recited examples and conditions. Moreover, all statements herein reciting principles, aspects, and embodiments of the invention, as well as specific examples thereof, are intended to encompass both structural and functional equivalents thereof. Additionally, it is intended that such equivalents include both currently known equivalents as well as equivalents developed in the future, i.e., any elements developed that perform the same function, regardless of structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Thus, for example, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that any block diagrams herein represent conceptual views of illustrative circuitry embodying the principles of the invention. Similarly, it will be appreciated that any flow charts, flow diagrams, state transition diagrams, pseudocode, and the like represent various processes which may be substantially represented in computer readable medium and so executed by a computer or processor, whether or not such computer or processor is explicitly shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The functions of the various elements shown in the FIGS., including any functional blocks labeled as &ldquo;processors&rdquo;, may be provided through the use of dedicated hardware as well as hardware capable of executing software in association with appropriate software. When provided by a processor, the functions may be provided by a single dedicated processor, by a single shared processor, or by a plurality of individual processors, some of which may be shared. Moreover, explicit use of the term &ldquo;processor&rdquo; or &ldquo;controller&rdquo; should not be construed to refer exclusively to hardware capable of executing software, and may implicitly include, without limitation, digital signal processor (DSP) hardware, network processor, application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), field programmable gate array (FPGA), read-only memory (ROM) for storing software, random access memory (RAM), and non-volatile storage. Other hardware, conventional and/or custom, may also be included. Similarly, any switches shown in the FIGS. are conceptual only. Their function may be carried out through the operation of program logic, through dedicated logic, through the interaction of program control and dedicated logic, or even manually, the particular technique being selectable by the implementer as more specifically understood from the context. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In the claims hereof any element expressed as a means for performing a specified function is intended to encompass any way of performing that function including, for example, a) a combination of circuit elements which performs that function or b) software in any form, including, therefore, firmware, microcode or the like, combined with appropriate circuitry for executing that software to perform the function. The invention as defined by such claims resides in the fact that the functionalities provided by the various recited means are combined and brought together in the manner which the claims call for. Applicant thus regards any means which can provide those functionalities as equivalent as those shown herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Software modules, or simply modules which are implied to be software, may be represented herein as any combination of flowchart elements or other elements indicating performance of process steps and/or textual description. Such modules may be executed by hardware which is expressly or implicitly shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Unless otherwise explicitly specified herein, the drawings are not drawn to scale. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Additionally, unless otherwise explicitly specified herein, any lens shown and/or described herein is actually an optical system having the particular specified properties of that lens. Such an optical system may be implemented by a single lens element but is not necessarily limited thereto. Similarly, where a mirror is shown and/or described what is actually being shown and/or described is an optical system with the specified properties of such a mirror, which may be implemented by a single mirror element but is not necessarily limited to a single mirror element. This is because, as is well known in the art, various optical systems may provide the same functionality of a single lens element or mirror but in a superior way, e.g., with less distortion. Furthermore, as is well known in the art, the functionality of a curved mirror may be realized via a combination of lenses and mirrors and vice versa. Moreover, any arrangement of optical components that are performing a specified function, e.g., an imaging system, gratings, coated elements, and prisms, may be replaced by any other arrangement of optical components that perform the same specified function. Thus, unless otherwise explicitly specified here, all optical elements or systems that are capable of providing specific function within an overall embodiment disclosed herein are equivalent to one another. for purposes of the present disclosure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The term micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) device as used herein is intended to mean an entire MEMS device or any portion thereof. Thus, if a portion of a MEMS device is inoperative, or if a portion of a MEMS device is occluded, such a MEMS device is nonetheless considered to be a MEMS device for purposes of the present disclosure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> We have recognized that the limitations on the number of ports in an all-optical switch due to the constraints on the size and/or effective tilt range of the optical MEMS devices can be overcome, in accordance with the principles of the invention, by imaging one or more optical MEMS devices using an imaging system in combination with an actual other optical MEMS device, or an image thereof, to form a single virtual optical MEMS device that has the size of each of the optical MEMS devices combined. This can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, which shows one embodiment of an all-optical switching arrangement in which each of two optical MEMS devices are imaged using respective imaging systems to form a virtual optical MEMS device that has the size of each of the optical MEMS devices combined. Shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> are a) first input fiber bundle <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, b) first input micro lens array <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, c) first input MEMS device <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, d) lens <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, e) lens <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>, f) second input fiber bundle <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, g) second input micro lens array <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, h) second input MEMS device <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, i) lens <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>, j) lens <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>, k) first output fiber bundle <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, l) first output micro lens array <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, m) first output MEMS device <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>, n) prism <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>, and o) field lens <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> First input fiber bundle <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> supplies optical signals to be switched. More specifically, each fiber of first input fiber bundle <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is an input port to the switching system of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The light supplied by each fiber of first input fiber bundle <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> passes through a respective corresponding micro lens that is part of first input micro lens array <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The function of each micro lens is to collimate the beam of light supplied from its respective associated input fiber. In alternative embodiments of the invention, in lieu of employing a separate micro lens array, a lens may be integrated with each fiber of input fiber bundle <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> in an arrangement that forms a collimator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The beams of light passing from first input micro lens array <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> each falls upon a respective micro mirror of first input MEMS device <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. Each micro mirror of first input MEMS device <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is set to reflect the beam of light incident on it at a respective prescribed angle. The particular prescribed angle is selected so that in combination with the angle of a corresponding respective micro mirror of first output MEMS device <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> the light is directed to a preselected fiber in first output fiber bundle <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> After reflecting off of its particular micro mirror, each beam of light passes to prism <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> via lens <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and lens <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. Lens <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and lens <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> form an imaging system. The imaging system is arranged so that the angles of incidence of each beam produced at prism <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> is a function of the angle of each micro mirror of first input MEMS device <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. In simpler embodiments of the invention, the imaging system is arranged so that it reproduces the angle of reflection of the light from each micro mirror of first input MEMS device <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> at prism <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>. Thus, there is a direct imaging of each micro mirror of first input MEMS device <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> to the location of prism <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>. Note that although two lenses are shown making up the imaging system, this is for pedagogical and clarity purposes only. Those of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that any imaging system, e.g., a system using one or more lenses, may be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the invention, a telecentric system, also known as a 4 f system is employed as the imaging system. By using a telecentric system, such systems being well known in the art, the angle of reflection of the light of each beam from first input MEMS device <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is reproduced when that light reaches prism <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>. Note that, since the telecentric system may be inverting, the respective corresponding micro mirrors of first output MEMS device <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> may not be in the same location as they would be had an imaging system not been employed. However, since the one-to-one nature of the mapping of micro mirrors is preserved by the imaging system, the inversion can easily be accounted for in the control software of the system to properly tilt the micro mirrors of first output MEMS device <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> to direct the light from the image to the prescribed output fiber of first output fiber bundle <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Note that the imaging system may also change the size of the image as compared with the original. This would allow the micro mirrors of first output MEMS device <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> to be a different size that those of first input MEMS device <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, as well as allowing the micro mirror spacing of first output MEMS device <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> to be a different than that of first input MEMS device <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. Doing so, however, will scale the angle of tilt of each of the micro mirrors of first input MEMS device <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> as it appears in the image, which will necessitate complementary compensation of the actual tilt in order to properly address the image to the micro mirrors of first output MEMS device <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

Advantageously, great flexibility in system design is achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Second input fiber bundle <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> also supplies optical signals to be switched. More specifically, each fiber of second input fiber bundle <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is also an input port to the switching system of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The light supplied by each fiber of second input fiber bundle <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> passes through a respective corresponding micro lens that is part of second input micro lens array <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The function of each micro lens is to collimate the beam of light supplied from its respective associated input fiber. In alternative embodiments of the invention, in lieu of employing a separate micro lens array, a lens may be integrated with each fiber of second input fiber bundle <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> in an arrangement that forms a collimator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The beams of light passing from second input micro lens array <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> each falls upon a respective micro mirror of second input MEMS device <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. Each micro mirror of second input MEMS device <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> is set to reflect the beam of light incident on it at a respective prescribed angle. The particular prescribed angle is selected so that in combination with the angle of a corresponding respective micro mirror of first output MEMS device <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> the light is directed to a preselected fiber in first output fiber bundle <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> After reflecting off of its particular micro mirror, each beam of light passes to prism <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> via lens <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> and lens <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>. Lens <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> and lens <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> form an imaging system. The imaging system is arranged so that the angles of each micro mirror of second input MEMS device <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> is reproduced at prism <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>. Thus, there is a direct imaging of each micro mirror of second input MEMS device <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> to the location of prism <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>. Note that although two lenses are shown making up the imaging system, this is for pedagogical and clarity purposes only. Those of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that any imaging system, e.g., a system using one or more lenses, may be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the invention, a telecentric system, also known as a 4 f system is employed as the imaging system. By using a telecentric system, such systems being well known in the art, the angle of reflection of the light of each beam from second input MEMS device <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> is reproduced when that light reaches prism <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>. Note that, since the telecentric system may be inverting, the respective corresponding micro mirrors of first output MEMS device <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> may not be in the same location as they would be had an imaging system not been employed. However, since the one-to-one nature of the mapping of micro mirrors is preserved by the imaging system, the inversion can easily be accounted for in the control software of the system to properly tilt the micro mirrors of first output MEMS device <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> to direct the light from the image to the prescribed output fiber of first output fiber bundle <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. Note that although two lenses are shown making up the telecentric system, this is for pedagogical and clarity purposes only. Those of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that any telecentric system, e.g., system using more lenses, may be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Note that the imaging system may also change the size of the image as compared with the original. This would allow the micro mirrors of first output MEMS device <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> to be a different size that those of second input MEMS device <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, as well as allowing the micro mirror spacing of first output MEMS device <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> to be a different than that of second input MEMS device <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. Doing so, however, will scale the angle of tilt of each of the micro mirrors of second input MEMS device <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> as it appears in the image, which will necessitate complementary compensation of the actual tilt in order to properly address the image to the micro mirrors of first output MEMS device <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, it is possible to employ optical splitters, e.g., between lenses <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>, to create multiple signal paths through the system, e.g., to implement a multicast, broadcast, monitoring, protection and restoration functions.

<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The function of prism <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> is to bend the paths of the image of first input MEMS device <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and the image of second input MEMS device <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment of the invention shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the bending is performed so that after passing through prism <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> the resulting image appears as if first input MEMS device <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and second input MEMS device <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> are adjacent to each other with the point at which they meet being along the line that passes from the center of field lens <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> through the center of prism <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>. Thus, in accordance with the principles of the invention, an image is produced of a single input MEMS device having the combined size of first input MEMS device <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and second input MEMS device <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. This image acts as a virtual MEMS input device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment of the invention shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, prism <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> has at least two sections, one for bending the image of first input MEMS device <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and the other for bending the image of second input MEMS device <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. In practice, the two sections may be separate prisms, or a single integrated device may be employed. Preferably, all the beams of light of the image of first input MEMS device <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> are bent the same amount and similarly the beams of light of the image of second input MEMS device <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> are all bent the same amount. However, the amounts by which all the beams of light of the image of first input MEMS device <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> are bent need not be the same as the amount that all the beams of light of the image of second input MEMS device <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> are bent. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the function of prism <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> may be carried out with various other lens arrangements as well. The particular arrangement for carrying out the function of prism <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> will be selected based on design considerations such as cost and overall-optical system architecture, i.e., the overall lensing system employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The light of the image of the combined optical MEMS device passes through optional field lens <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> on its way to first output MEMS device <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. Optional field lens translates the angle at which the light is incident onto each micro mirror into a position to which the light will be directed. This allows all the micro mirrors of first input MEMS device <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and second input MEMS device <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> to be homogenized, in that all micro mirrors having the same tilt will direct their light to the same position. Furthermore, the field lens refocuses each of the beams that pass through it, thus reducing loss. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The beams of light passing from field lens <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> each falls upon a respective micro mirror of first output MEMS device <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>.

The particular angle is selected so that the light incident on the micro mirror is reflected to particular fiber of first output fiber bundle <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> that is to receive the light and act as output port for that light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The beams of light passing from each micro mirror of first output MEMS device <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> pass through a respective micro lens of micro lens array <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. The function of each micro lens is to couple the light beam into its respective associated output fiber. In alternative embodiments of the invention, in lieu of employing a separate micro lens array, a lens may be integrated with each fiber of output fiber of fiber bundle <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> in an arrangement that forms a collimator. The light from each of micro lens of micro lens array <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> then passes into the respective output fiber bundle that is associated with the micro lens. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The beams of light are reflected back by mirror <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> toward prism <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> as return beams. Prism <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> changes the direction of the return beams in the same manner as prism <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight> described hereinabove. More specifically, for light coming from mirror <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> on its way to one of the imaging systems, prism <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> performs the inverse of the function that it performed for light coming from the imaging systems going toward mirror <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>. To this end, prism <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> directs the light incident on it in two directions, the first being through the imaging system made up of lens <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and lens <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> with the second being through the imaging system made up of lens <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>. Those beams which are incident on prism <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> at a point which corresponds to an image of first MEMS device <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> are directed by prism <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> to the imaging system made up of lenses <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. Likewise, those beams which are incident on prism <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> at a point which corresponds to an image of second output MEMS device <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> are directed by prism <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> to the imaging system made up of lenses <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Typically the return beams are incident upon a different micro mirror than the micro mirror that initially reflected them towards mirror <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>, but this is not a requirement, and for any input beam of light the return beam may indeed be incident the same micro mirror from which it was reflected towards mirror <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>. Doing so enables any fiber in the fiber bundle to be connected to any other fiber in the fiber bundle. including itself. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Each return beam then passes through the respective imaging system to which it is directed and is then reflected by the micro mirror of the corresponding one of first and second MEMS device <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> toward a respective fiber of the associated one of fiber bundles <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> that is to act as the output port for the beam. After being reflected from the micro mirror, but prior to entering the fiber, the beam passes through a micro lens of the one of micro lens arrays <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> that is associated with the fiber that is acting as the output port for the beam. </paragraph>

However, mirrors are employed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> in lieu of prisms <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight> which results in the optical paths following different spatial paths. This results in a more compact system arrangement. Shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> are the same elements as is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> except that prism <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight> have been removed and instead the additional elements of mirrors <highlight><bold>541</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>551</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>561</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>571</bold></highlight> have been added. The operation of all elements of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is the same as described for the like numbered components of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The function of mirror <highlight><bold>541</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>561</bold></highlight> is similar to the function of prism <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> in that they bend the paths of the image of first input MEMS device <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and the image of second input MEMS device <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment of the invention shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the bending is performed so that after passing through mirrors <highlight><bold>541</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>561</bold></highlight> the resulting image appears as if first input MEMS device <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and second input MEMS device <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> are adjacent to each other with the point at which they meet being along the line that passes from the center of field lens <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> through the point at which mirrors <highlight><bold>541</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>561</bold></highlight> meet. Note, however, that the use of mirrors in lieu of a prism changes the direction of the light beams, thereby providing a more compact structure. Thus, in accordance with the principles of the invention, an image is produced of a single input MEMS device having the combined size of first input MEMS device <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and second input MEMS device <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. This image acts as a virtual MEMS input device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment of the invention shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, there are at least two distinct mirrors, one for bending the image of first input MEMS device <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and the other for bending the image of second input MEMS device <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. In practice, the two sections may be joined to form a single integrated mirror.

Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the function of mirrors <highlight><bold>541</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>561</bold></highlight> may be carried out with various mirror arrangements, e.g., curved mirrors, which may be supplemented by additional mirror or lens functions. The particular arrangement for carrying out the function of mirrors <highlight><bold>541</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>561</bold></highlight> will be selected based on design considerations such as cost and overall optical system architecture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The function of mirror <highlight><bold>551</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>571</bold></highlight> is similar to the function of prism <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight> in that they bend the paths of the image of first output MEMS device <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> and the image of second output MEMS device <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> First input fiber bundle <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> supplies optical signals to be switched. More specifically, each fiber of first input fiber bundle <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is an input port to the switching system of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The light supplied by each fiber of first input fiber bundle <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> passes through a respective corresponding micro lens that is part of first input micro lens array <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The function of each micro lens is to collimate the beam of light supplied from its respective associated input fiber. In alternative embodiments of the invention, in lieu of employing a separate micro lens array, a lens may be integrated with each fiber of input fiber bundle <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> in an arrangement that forms a collimator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The beams of light passing from first input micro lens array <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> each falls upon a respective micro mirror of first input MEMS device <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. Each micro mirror of first input MEMS device <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is set to reflect the beam of light incident on it at a respective prescribed angle. The particular angle is prescribed so that, in combination with the angle of a corresponding respective micro mirror of one of first output MEMS device <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> and second output MEMS device <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight>, the light is directed to a preselected fiber in either first output fiber bundle <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> or second output fiber bundle <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> After reflecting off of its particular micro mirror, each beam of light passes through lens <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, then lens <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>, to mirror <highlight><bold>541</bold></highlight>. Lens <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and lens <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> form an imaging system. The imaging system is arranged so that the angles of each micro mirror of first input MEMS device <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is reproduced at mirror <highlight><bold>541</bold></highlight>. Thus, there is a direct imaging of each micro mirror of first input MEMS device <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> to the location of mirror <highlight><bold>541</bold></highlight>. Note that although two lenses are shown making up the imaging system, this is for pedagogical and clarity purposes only. Those of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that any imaging system, e.g., a system using one or more lenses, may be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the invention, a telecentric system, also known as a 4 f system is employed as the imaging system. By using a telecentric system, such systems being well known in the art, the angle of reflection of the light of each beam from first input MEMS device <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is reproduced when that light reaches mirror <highlight><bold>541</bold></highlight>. Note that, since the telecentric system may be inverting, the respective corresponding micro mirrors of first output MEMS device <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> may not be in the same location as they would be had an imaging system not been employed. However, since the one-to-one nature of the mapping of micro mirrors is preserved by the imaging system, the inversion can easily be accounted for in the control software of the system to properly tilt the micro mirrors of first output MEMS device <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> to direct the light from the image to the prescribed output fiber of first output fiber bundle <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Note that the imaging system may also change the size of the image as compared with the original. This would allow the micro mirrors of first output MEMS device <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> and second output MEMS device <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight> to be a different size that those of first input MEMS device <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, as well as allowing the micro mirror spacing of first output MEMS device <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> and second output MEMS device <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight> to be different than that of first input MEMS device <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. Doing so, however, will scale the angle of tilt of each of the micro mirrors of first input MEMS device <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> as it appears in the image, which will necessitate complementary compensation of the actual tilt in order to properly address the image to the micro mirrors of first output MEMS device <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> and second output MEMS device <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, it is possible to employ optical splitters, e.g., between lenses <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>, to create multiple signal paths through the system, e.g., to implement a multicast, broadcast, monitoring, protection and restoration functions. Advantageously, great flexibility in system design is achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Second input fiber bundle <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> also supplies optical signals to be switched. More specifically, each fiber of second input fiber bundle <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is also an input port to the switching system of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The light supplied by each fiber of second input fiber bundle <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> passes through a respective corresponding micro lens that is part of second input micro lens array <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The function of each micro lens is to collimate the beam of light supplied from its respective associated input fiber. In alternative embodiments of the invention, in lieu of employing a separate micro lens a lens may be integrated with each fiber of fiber bundle second input <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> in an arrangement that forms a collimator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The beams of light passing from second input micro lens array <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> each falls upon a respective micro mirror of second input MEMS device <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. Each micro mirror of second input MEMS device <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> is set to reflect the beam of light incident on it at a respective prescribed angle. The particular angle is prescribed so that in combination with the angle of a corresponding respective micro mirror of first output MEMS device <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> or second output MEMS device <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight> the light is directed to a preselected fiber in first output fiber bundle <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> or second output fiber bundle <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> After reflecting off of its particular micro mirror, each beam of light passes to field lens <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The function of mirror <highlight><bold>541</bold></highlight> is to bend the path of the image of first input MEMS device <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> so that the resulting image appears as if first input MEMS device <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is adjacent to second input MEMS device <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> with the point at which the image and actual MEMS device meet being along the line that passes from the center of field lens <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> through the center of prism <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight>. Thus, in accordance with the principles of the invention, it appears that there is a single input MEMS device having the combined size of first input MEMS device <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and second input MEMS device <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. This combination acts as the total input MEMS device, which is a virtual MEMS device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> After passing through field lens <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>, the light enters the output section of the switching system, i.e., all elements in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> to the right of field lens <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>. The operation field lens <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> and the output section of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is the same as described for the like numbered components of the output section of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Note that for pedagogical and clarity purposes, the embodiments shown have only combined for the input section or the output section at most two MEMS devices, either images thereof or a real portion and an image portion. However, it is possible to have embodiments of the invention in which there are stacked more than two MEMS device, e.g., by arranging any of the preceding embodiments three dimensionally, e.g., out of the plane of the paper on which the embodiments are shown. Such arrangements allow the MEMS devices, or images thereof, to be &ldquo;tiled&rdquo; to create even larger virtual MEMS devices for input, output, or both. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows tiling arrangements <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight> for MEMS devices, or images thereof, <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight> which are some of the various tiling arrangements that are possible. Those of ordinary skill in the art will be readily able to develop other such arrangements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows an end-on view of one such arrangement in which the image of four output MEMS devices are joined to from one large output MEMS device. Although not visible in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, because they are directly behind the elements shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, four input MEMS devices are similarly joined to from one large input MEMS device. Alternatively, one may consider <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> to be an end-on view of the output section but looking from the opposite end. The numbers of the elements shown in FIG. l correspond functionally to the like numbered elements of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, but with a suffix of 1 added for those elements that were shown originally in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and a suffix of 2 added for those elements introduced in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> to form the even larger array. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Those of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate how to orient the various components and mirrors of the system in order to achieve their desired size and configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Note that instead of optical fibers supplying the light beams as inputs. they may be supplied by an optical source, e.g., a laser or light emitting diode, planar wave guides, or the like. Likewise, instead of having optical fibers receiving the light beams as outputs the light beams could be received by other receivers such as photo detectors, planar wave guides, or the like. </paragraph>
