<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to a method for a web portal providing personalized/customized electronic stamp advertisements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Obtaining postage has often entailed such time consuming processes of purchasing stamps from a post office, transporting packages to the post office for metering or the leasing of expensive dedicated postage meters. This has often accounted for a considerable loss in productivity, as staff would have to travel to the post office to acquire postage by having the postal authorities directly meter mail, by purchasing of stamps, tokens or replenishing the postage meter. Although, there have been developments in this area which have permitted the replenishment of postage meters via telecommunication (see for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,157,919 and 4,831,554), these remedies still require that the user be in the possession of a postage meter capable of receiving uploaded postage via telecommunication means. These means offer only a very limited capability to provide the customer the opportunity to feature customized or personalized postal indicia. Beyond this point, the customer is required to maintain a postal account for postage. It would be a significant advantage to have a means whereby postage could be made available to the customer anytime of day without traveling to the post office. Additional advantage would be realized by a system that could offer postage without requiring a postal account, postal meters or specialized systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Subsequent developments have sought to remedy some of these concerns by offering the customer computer readable programs that could reside on a personal computer, (see for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,319,562, 5,819,240, 5,717,597, 5,801,944 and 6,208,980). These methods provide for the use of replenishment of postage tokens either, in the form of hardware or firmware via modem or other telecommunication means. Again in each case the customer must incur the cost of software and establish a postal account. These methods are further restricted to platforms that are compatible with user&apos;s personal computer. Furthermore, these systems possess limited portability, insofar as the software must be resident upon a customer&apos;s computer subject to inherent licensing restrictions imposed by the software manufacturer. Although, there are provisions for the incorporation of customized/personalized postal indicia these are limited principally to those elements provided with the software license. Moreover, these particular systems do not allow low volume postal customers to enjoy postal subsidies for permitting third party advertisers to utilize the postal indicia as ad space. It would be desirable to have a portable system that would be overcome the requirements to establish postal accounts and would allow unrestricted access to third party advertiser postage subsidies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The aspect of third party advertising postal subsidies has traditionally been limited to high volume postal patrons and often requires the use of highly specialized apparatus and systems as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,178,411B1, 6,141,654 and 6,173,274B1. As the prospect of reaching a target market via postal advertising is extremely low, the incentive to offer subsidies has been reserved to large bulk mail patrons. Although, the aforementioned systems serve to provide an improved target market through the integration of demographics and advertising requirements, they lack the accuracy of direct customer response. Further, these systems require that both advertisers and bulk mailers maintain postage accounts on the mail system. These accounts are not necessarily real-time financial data and may result in either patrons missing an advertising opportunity due to inaccurate accounting data or a subsidy being offered when an account may be overdrawn. These systems frequently employ various commercial softwares to verify the address data provided by the bulk mailer to construct a demographic database that is presumed to be directed to the advertiser&apos;s target market in return for a subsidy. These methods lack the direct customer input that would yield a higher quality target market wholly independent of demographic models. It would be desirable to have a system that would provide third party advertising subsidies directly to individual and volume customers. It would also be desirable to have a system that would produce a more accurate target market listing to third party advertisers thereby allowing higher postal subsidies to be affected due to improved market targeting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It would also be desirable to have a system that would allow the consumer to accurately post mail whereby the consumer could benefit from reduced cost from excess postage and avoid untimely mail delays due to insufficient postage. Such a system would also aid in reducing postal costs, as the handling of metered mail is a fraction of the cost of hand sorted mail. As the trend toward increased automation in mail handling continues the need to enhance efficiency and productivity are paramount to maintain postage costs and services. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It would be desirable to have a system, which overcomes the aforementioned disadvantages. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates one embodiment of a system for a web portal providing personalized/customized electronic stamp advertisements in accordance with the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> one embodiment of a web portal system providing personalized/customized electronic stamp advertisements is generally shown at number <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The electronic stamp web portal system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may include a customer node <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, financial node <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, postal node <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, advertiser node <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and Internet <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may receive a customer request to purchase postage via Internet <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> herein referred to as an electronic stamp <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> from the customer node <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The customer node <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may utilize any personal computer, personal digital assistant, digital telephone or any device capable of transmitting and receiving data over the Internet <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> known in the art and any means for printing the electronic transmission of postage, (electronic stamps) onto a medium acceptable to postal authorities. The customer node <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be operably connected to the Internet <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The Internet <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> may route any number of digital signals to any of a plurality of server site addresses via various telecommunication means over the World Wide Web. Any commercially available Internet Service Provider (ISP), known in the art providing access to the World Wide Web, may access the Internet <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> for receiving and directing the customer request to buy postage to the postal node <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The postal node <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be any commercially available computer server capable of providing secure transactions over the Internet <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> via any hardware and/or software methods known in the art. The postal node <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may receive a customer request for postage from the Internet <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the postal node <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may convert the request for postage into a Postal Transaction Code (PTC) that may contain the customer identification data and total postage cost in addition to data packets that detail and facilitate the purchase of postage via the Internet <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The postal node <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be operably connected to the Internet <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The postal node <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> transmits a subsidized postage inquiry to the customer node <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> via the Internet <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, which asks the customer if they would accept third party advertisements on their electronic stamp <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to offset the postage cost. The customer node <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> receives the subsidized postage inquiry from the postal node <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> via the Internet <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The customer node <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may either accept or decline the subsidized postage inquiry and may send a subsidized postage inquiry response to the postal node <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> via the Internet <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The postal node <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> upon receiving a subsidized postage inquiry response from the customer node <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> via the Internet <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> evaluates the response. In reply to a positive response from the customer node <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> the postal node transmits the customer identification and PTC to the advertiser node <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> via the Internet <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment if the response is negative the postal node <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> transmits a total postage cost and PTC to the customer via the Internet <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The advertiser node <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may be any commercially available computer server capable of providing secure transactions over the Internet <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> via any hardware and/or software methods known in the art. The advertiser node <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may receive a customer subsidy inquiry reply for subsidized postage from the postal node <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> via the Internet <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The advertiser node may be operably connected to the Internet <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The advertiser node <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> the evaluates the reply using any commercially available demographic models or marketing tools known in the art to select from a bank of third party advertisers offering a subsidy to patrons in return for updated marketing data. In one embodiment the advertiser node <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may convert non-secured portions of the PTC into market survey listings and statistics. The advertiser node <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> subsequent to surveying the reply generates a list of a plurality of advertisers to subsidize postage, which are transmitted to the customer node <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> via the Internet <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The customer node <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> receives the list of advertisers willing to subsidize postage from the advertiser node <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> via the Internet <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The customer node <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may select one or more advertisers, based upon postal restrictions and transmits the selection to the advertiser node <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> via the Internet <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment the customer node <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> declines to participate with a third party advertiser and is redirected to the postal node <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> for payment of the total postage. In another embodiment the customer node <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may select the option to produce customized or personalized postage using customer-supplied graphics facilitated through a third party for a fee. The customer node <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> subsequent to selecting an advertisement will then transmit payment of the subsidized postage and the PTC to the financial node <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> via the Internet <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The advertiser node receives the selection from the customer node <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> via the Internet <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The advertiser node <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> then transmits the PTC and a release for payment against the selected advertiser to the financial node <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> via the Internet <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The financial node <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be any commercially available computer server capable of providing secure financial transactions over the Internet <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> via any hardware and/or software methods known in the art. The financial node <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may receive an electronic payment request from any of the advertiser node <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> or the customer node <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The financial node <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be operably connected to the Internet <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The financial node <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may assemble the payment data using the PTC and other unique identifiers and methods known in the banking and the art of electronic financial transactions. The financial node <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> verifies the availability of funds from the advertiser node <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and the customer node <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Should the customer node <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> have insufficient funds to cover the cost of postage the financial node <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> will terminate the transaction and will not permit the transfer of funds from the advertiser node <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> accounts. Should the financial node <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> determine that the advertiser node <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to have insufficient funds to subsidize the postage the decline is forwarded to the postal node <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> via the Internet <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. Subsequent to performing payment verification the financial node <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> transmits the verification data to the customer node <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the advertiser node <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and to the postal node <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> over the Internet <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The advertiser node <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> subsequent to receipt of the payment verification from the financial node <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> via the Internet <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> transmits the advertisement for inclusion in the postal indicia to the postal node <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> via Internet <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment the advertiser node <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may insure that the advertisement satisfies postal hygiene requirements that mandate that no defamatory or offensive graphics or statements may be incorporated in the postal indicia, before releasing the advertisement to the postal node <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The advertiser node <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may assemble a database of customer preferences and utilize cookies or other similar software applications to collect and secure marketing data. The advertising node <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may also create a unique customer identifier that would contain the customer&apos;s preferences that may be attached or embedded in the PTC during future transactions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The postal node <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may receive the advertisement from the advertiser node <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> via the Internet <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The postal node <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> subsequent to receipt of the advertisement may verify its hygiene and may incorporate it into the postal indicia and may transmit the postage <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to the customer node via the Internet <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The customer node <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may receive payment verification from the financial node <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> via the Internet <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. This information may be processed separately or in conjunction with the postal indicia received from the postal node <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The customer node <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> upon receipt of the postal indicia may transmit the postal indicia to any printer known in the art to print the postage, electronic stamp <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> either directly onto an envelope, package, label or any medium designated for such use by postal authorities. Subsequent to printing, the transaction may be terminated. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference> one embodiment of a method of a web portal for purchasing customizable/personalized electronic stamps is generally shown at <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. A customer requests to purchase an electronic stamp <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> where the customer node <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> transmits the request over the Internet <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to the postal node <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (Block <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>). The postal node <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> upon receipt of the customer request may generate a Postal Transaction Code (PTC), which may include the customer identification, total postage cost and unique information to facilitate secure postal transactions (Block <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>). The postal node <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> subsequent to the generation of the PTC will send the customer an inquiry for third party advertiser postage subsidy in addition to the PTC where the postal node <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> transmits the inquiry over the Internet <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to the customer node <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (Block <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>). The customer may decide to accept or decline third party advertising to subsidize postal costs. Subsequently. the decision to accept or decline third party advertising to subsidize postal costs is communicated where the customer node <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> transmits the reply via the Internet <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to the postal node <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (Block <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Should the customer decline third party advertising subsidies the postal node <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> provides the total postage cost to the customer with the PTC, where the postal node <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> transmits the data to the customer node <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> via the Internet <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> (Block <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>). The customer upon receiving the postage cost may decide to facilitate payment or cancel the transaction (Block <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>). The customer may decide to facilitate payment by using any means of electronic payment as a financial institution designated to handle such transactions would accept where the customer node <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> transmits the payment data over the Internet <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to the financial node <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (Block <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>).
