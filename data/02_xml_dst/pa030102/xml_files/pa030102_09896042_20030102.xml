<heading lvl="1">FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present application relates to an information processing system, and more particularly to a method and system for registering product purchases with a manufacturer, manufacturer representative, vendor or other entity using information obtained at the point of purchase. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The registration of a purchased product is often necessary to take advantage of services offered by or on behalf of the manufacturer or vendor of the product. For instance, products often must be registered to take advantage of a manufacturer&apos;rebate and to activate a manufacturer&apos;s warranty. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In addition, product registration can present the manufacturer or third party with additional sales opportunities and demographic data on the customer. For instance, if a manufacturer has information about the purchasers of its products it can direct its advertisements for related products and services specifically to the purchaser. Thus, manufacturers and vendors can use customer information to advertise and to offer discounts, coupons for accessory products or product upgrades. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Ordinarily, the purchaser manually registers the product by filling out a card with the required information and mailing it to the manufacturer or other designated entity. This process takes time and purchasers do not always go to the trouble to fill out the cards. It is not uncommon with regard to warranty cards, for example, that by the time the purchaser gets around to filling out the card, the purchaser has misplaced the sales receipt or has forgotten purchase information that the manufacturer has requested on the warranty card. In addition, the use of a warranty card requires that the manufacturer employ personnel to receive the warranty cards and to key in the information contained on them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Some manufacturers have offered on-line warranty registration over the Internet. However, even on-line registration requires that the purchaser take the trouble to visit the manufacturer&apos;s web site, to find the appropriate web page and to enter the required information on the web page. Some purchasers never go to the trouble of registering their purchases, sometimes forfeiting the opportunity to activate the manufacturer&apos;s warranty. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The process of obtaining a manufacturer&apos;s rebate on a purchase similarly requires that the purchaser fill out and mail in an information form. In addition, in order to receive a rebate manufacturers commonly require that the purchaser provide proof of purchase information, such as a UPC code and a sales receipt. However, purchasers often lose or misplace their sales receipts, fail to take the time to fill out the forms or simply forget to apply for the rebate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> There is a need for an improved method and system for registering product purchases for purposes of product warranty, rebate, upgrades, recalls, cross-selling and the like. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> An aspect of the present application provides a computer-implemented method of registering a product on behalf of a purchaser who purchases the product using a financial instrument, such as a credit card, debit card or smart card. The method comprises receiving from a vendor purchase information for the product purchased by the purchaser, the purchase information including a purchase date and a product identifier, receiving from the vendor an identifier of the financial instrument, for instance, a credit card account number, that the purchaser used to purchase the product, retrieving information of the purchaser from a financial institution that issued the financial instrument and transmitting the purchase information and the purchaser information to a manufacturer of the product for registration of the product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the present application provides a method for registering a product for warranty service. The method includes obtaining product information, purchase information and customer information electronically from the vendor, using the information to obtain additional information about the product purchased, the purchaser, and the manufacturer or other entity to which the information is to be provided, formatting the information if it is not received in a pre-formatted state pursuant to the requirements of the manufacturer or other entity that is to receive the warranty information, providing the warranty information to the manufacturer or other entities, receiving a confirmation that the product has been registered for warranty purposes and sending a warranty registration confirmation to the purchaser. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A further aspect of the present application provides a method for obtaining a rebate on a product on behalf of a purchaser of the product. The method includes obtaining product information, purchase information and customer information electronically from the vendor, using the information to obtain additional information about the product purchased, the purchaser, the vendor, the manufacturer or other entity to which the information is to be provided, formatting the information if it is not received in a pre-formatted state pursuant to the requirements of the manufacturer or other entity that is to receive the rebate information, providing the rebate information to the vendor, manufacturer or other entity, receiving a confirmation that the rebate information has been received by the manufacturer or other entity and sending a rebate registration confirmation to the purchaser. An extension of this aspect of the present application provides a method by which a purchaser may obtain a rebate at the point of sale. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A further aspect of the invention extends to a scenario in which a vendor serves as a controller, or a manufacturer serves as a vendor and/or controller.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The present invention is a method by which an entity, such as a credit card issuer, can provide purchase and purchaser information to a manufacturer for various purposes, including to facilitate upgrades, recalls, cross-selling of related products, activation of manufacturer warranties, and rebates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In the ordinary retail transaction made with a credit card, the purchaser chooses a product to purchase and presents the product to the vendor at the point of sale. Generally, the vendor scans the product&apos;s UPC code and swipes the purchaser&apos;s credit card. The vendor then transmits to a transaction authorizing party information concerning the product and manufacturer, such as the product&apos;s UPC code, information concerning the transaction, such as the vendor&apos;s identification and location, the date of purchase and the transaction amount and information concerning the purchaser, such as the purchaser&apos;s name, credit card number and the credit card expiration date. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>illustrates a method <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> for providing product purchase information to a manufacturer where one or more items of the information provided to the manufacturer comes from the point of sale, either directly, or indirectly through an authorizing agent or other entity. Although the embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>refers to a &ldquo;manufacturer&rdquo; as the ultimate recipient of the information, the information collected and can be provided to entities other than the manufacturer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The steps involved in providing product purchase information to a manufacturer in the present invention are illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>In step <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, the controller, which may be the credit card issuer or another entity, receives manufacturer information, product information, purchase information and purchaser information from the vendor, the authorizing agent or from another entity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The vendor may collect product information by various means including scanning the product&apos;s universal product code. The term &ldquo;universal product code&rdquo; is used to indicate standardized industry codes used to designate goods made or sold in commerce and includes the Universal Product Codes (&ldquo;UPC&rdquo; code) used by manufacturers, wholesalers and vendors in the United States and Canada, the EAN codes used by manufacturers, wholesalers and vendors outside the United States and Canada, and any other codes used by groups of manufacturers, wholesalers and vendors to identify products. The present invention is not limited to use with products manufactured or packaged with UPC codes, but may be used with any system of marking a product with an identifier, by way of example, a radio frequency identification (&ldquo;RFID&rdquo;) tag. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The purchase information includes the date of purchase, which the vendor may obtain by keying in the date of purchase, by obtaining the date of purchase from an electronic source or by any other means of obtaining the purchase date. The purchase information may include the price of the product, which may be keyed into a cash register, obtained from a database using the UPC code obtained from the product, or any other means of obtaining the product&apos;s price. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Purchaser information is obtained by swiping the customer&apos;s credit card through a card reader that reads information from the magnetic strip on the card and processes the information from the magnetic strip through techniques well known in the art. Although the exemplary embodiment refers to a &ldquo;credit card&rdquo;, the present invention is not limited to a credit card. Rather, the vendor may swipe a debit card or other card containing a purchaser identifier in machine readable form, read a smart card or key in, or have the purchaser key in, an account number assigned to the purchaser as opposed to swiping a credit card. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The manufacturer information includes a manufacturer identifier such as a UPC code. However, the manufacturer information may also include other information including information as to whether the manufacturer accepts information on transactions involving the product, the items of information the manufacturer accepts, the format the information should be in and an electronic or geographic address to which the information should be transmitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, the controller processes the information obtained in step <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>contains a more detailed illustration of step <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. In step <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>, the controller determines whether it has received information in step <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> as to whether the manufacturer accepts transaction information such as product, purchase and purchaser information. Some manufacturers may not gather information on sales of their products. Moreover, some manufacturers may gather information on only a subset of products that they manufacture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> If the manufacturer information received in step <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> does not indicate whether the manufacturer accepts information on transactions involving the product, in step <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> the controller queries a database using the manufacturer identifier and product identifier received in step <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to obtain information as to whether the manufacturer accepts information concerning the transaction. In step <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, the controller determines whether the manufacturer accepts purchase information for the purchased product. If the manufacturer does not accept such information, no further action would be performed with regard to that purchased product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> If the manufacturer accepts information concerning the transaction, in step <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> the controller determines whether it has sufficient manufacturer information to complete the process, such as the types of information the manufacturer accepts, the format the information should be in and the address to which the information should be sent. If the controller does not have all of the manufacturer information, the controller queries a database for the missing information in step <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. In the preferred embodiment a single manufacturer database contains all of the information needed from the manufacturer. However, the present invention includes a method and system in which the controller must query more than one database to obtain the manufacturer information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Once the controller has the information as to the types of information the manufacturer accepts, in step <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> the controller determines whether it obtained all of that information in step <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. If it does not have any particular item of information requested by the manufacturer, in step <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> the controller queries one or more appropriate databases for the missing information. For example, if the manufacturer requests that the information transmitted include the product model number, the controller would obtain the model number from a database containing product model numbers using the UPC code. Thus, in step <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, the controller obtains all of the additional information that the manufacturer requests and that the controller has ready access to. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Referring back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>in step <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, the controller then formats the product, purchase and purchaser information in the manner desired by the manufacturer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>, the controller transmits the information that the controller has obtained and that the manufacturer has requested to the address specified by the manufacturer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> As is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>the present invention can be used to register a product purchase to activate a product warranty. In step <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, the controller receives manufacturer information, product information, purchase information and purchaser information from the vendor, the authorizing agent or from another party. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, the controller processes the information obtained in step <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and gathers additional warranty information if it does not have all of the information that the manufacturer requests for warranty activation. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>contains a more detailed illustration of step <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. In step <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight>, the controller determines whether the information received in step <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> includes information as to whether the manufacturer offers a warranty on the purchased product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> If the manufacturer information received in step <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> does not include information as to whether the manufacturer offers a product warranty on the purchased product, in step <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> the controller queries a database using the manufacturer identifier and product identifier received in step <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> to obtain information as to whether the manufacturer offers a warranty on the purchased product. The controller then assesses in step <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> the information that it has to determine whether the manufacturer offers a warranty on the product. If the manufacturer does not offer a warranty on the product, no further action would be performed with regard to that product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> If the manufacturer offers a warranty on the product, in step <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> the controller determines whether it has sufficient manufacturer information, such as the types of information the manufacturer requires for warranty activation, the format the information should be in and the address to which the information should be sent. If the controller does not have all of the manufacturer information, in step <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> the controller queries one or more appropriate databases for the missing information. Once the controller has the information as to the types of information the manufacturer requires for warranty activation, in step <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> the controller determines whether it has that information. If it does not have any particular item of information, in step <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> the controller queries one or more appropriate databases for the information. Thus, in step <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> the controller obtains all of the additional warranty information that it has ready access to. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Referring back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>in step <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight>, the controller then formats the product, purchase and purchaser information that the manufacturer requires in the manner desired by the manufacturer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight>, the controller transmits the warranty information to the address specified by the manufacturer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>292</bold></highlight>, the controller stores the warranty information with the purchaser information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>294</bold></highlight>, the controller sends the purchaser confirmation that the warranty information has been forwarded to the manufacturer, and information as to the length of the warranty and the warranty terms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> As is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>the present invention can be used to apply for a manufacturer rebate on a purchased product. In step <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, the controller, which may be the credit card issuer or another party, receives manufacturer information, product information, purchase information and purchaser information from the vendor, the authorizing agent or from another party. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, the controller processes the information received in step <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and gathers additional rebate information if necessary. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>contains a more detailed illustration of step <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. In step <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight>, the controller determines whether the information received in step <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> includes information as to whether the manufacturer offers a rebate on the purchased product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> If the manufacturer information received in step <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> does not include information as to whether the manufacturer offers a rebate on the purchased product, in step <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> the controller queries a database using the manufacturer identifier and product identifier received in step <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> to obtain information as to whether the manufacturer offers a rebate on the purchased product. In step <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> the controller assesses the information that it has to determine whether the manufacturer offers a rebate on the product. If the manufacturer does not offer a rebate on the product, no further action would be performed with regard to that product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> If the manufacturer offers a rebate on the product, in step <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> the controller determines whether it has sufficient manufacturer information, such as the types of information the manufacturer requires for the rebate, the format the information should be in and the address to which the information should be sent. If the controller does not have all of the manufacturer information, in step <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> the controller queries one or more databases for the missing information. Once the controller has the information as to the types of information the manufacturer requires for the rebate, in step <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> the controller determines whether it has that information.
