<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Conventional methods of extracting selected organic from mixtures are energy intensive. Therefore, there is a great need to find methods of extracting liquid hydrocarbons requiring little or no energy. The closest known prior art is Burger, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,630,474 for a process of extracting crude oil. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> I have discovered an unusual effect which can be utilized for the extraction of hydrocarbons from (1) liquid-liquid organic mixtures, (2) liquid solid organic mixtures, (3) liquid solid organic/inorganic mixtures, (4) hydrocarbon-polymer gel mixtures, and (5) when said (1)-(4) mixtures are in a vapor-liquid, a vapor-solid, or a vapor-liquid-gel state; said hydrocarbon extractions of mixtures (1) through (5) can be performed using very little or no energy. The method of extraction involves differences in density, differences in surface and interfacial tensions, cohesive forces two or more liquids, and adhesive forces of liquid-solid surfaces under gravitational, buoyancy, or under other physical forces including acceleration and angular forces. Gel articles and gel composite articles with selected amount of oil extracted from its exterior surfaces can provide a higher rigidity gel exterior region or skin while maintain a lower rigidity interior. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> I have discover that the liquid hydrocarbons and certain additives contained in highly extended thermoplastic elastomer gels plasticized with oils can be extracted, separated, or removed from such gels by the use of a semi porous membrane utilizing little or no energy. The most suitable semi porous membrane is found to be a liquid coating of silicone fluid, other suitable membrane materials include silicone greases, silicone gels, silicone elastomers, and their combinations which are herein described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> With respect to thermoplastic elastomer gels, some are described in my U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,161,555, 6,148,830, 6,117,176, 6,050,871, 6,033,283, 5,962,572, 5,938,499, 5,884,639, 5,868,597, 5,760,117, 5,655,947, 5,633,286, 5,624,294, 5,508,334, 5,475,890, 5,336,708, 5,334,646, 5,324,222, 5,239,723, 5,153,254, 5,262,468, 4,618,213, and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>369</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>284</bold></highlight> including references cited in the above patents.

The above cited patents are incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Polymers plasticized with oil are many including SIS, SBS, SEBS, SEP, SI, SB, SEPSEP, high vinyl SEBS, (SEB)2-X-(I)2, (SB)2-X-(B)2, star diblock SEPS, SEEPS, SEB/EPS, SIBS, ESE, Dow E/S interpolymers, EPDM terpolymers (Nordel IP made from INSITE constrained geometry catalyst), and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Oil plasticizers forming gels of the above cited polymers include rubber processing oils such as paraffinic and naphthenic petroleum oils, highly refined aromatic-free paraffinic and naphthenic food and technical grade white petroleum mineral oils, and synthetic liquid oligomers of polybutene, polypropene, polyterpene, etc. The synthetic series process oils are high viscosity oligomers which are permanently fluid liquid nonolefins, isoparaffins or paraffins of low, moderate to high molecular weights. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The amount of plasticizing oils contained in the gels can vary depending on the gel rigidity of the gel which rigidity can range from less than 1 gram Bloom to about 3,000 gram Bloom and higher. As used herein, the term &ldquo;gel rigidity&rdquo; in gram Bloom is determined by the gram weight required to depress a gel a distance of 4 mm with a piston having a cross-sectional area of 1 square centimeter at 23&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The amount of plasticizer incorporated into the polymer gels (based on 100 parts by weight of polymer) cited above can range from about 1.0 part by weight to about 3,000 parts by weight and higher including about 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1,000, 1,500, 2,000 and the amount of plasticizer may also range in values between such values of parts by weights. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Examples of representative commercially available plasticizing oils include Amoco&reg; polybutenes, hydrogenated polybutenes, polybutenes with epoxide functionality at one end of the polybutene polymer, liquid poly(ethylene/butylene), liquid hetero-telechelic polymers of poly(ethylene/butylene/styrene) with epoxidized polyisoprene and poly(ethylene/butylene) with epoxidized polyisoprene: Example of such polybutenes include: L-14 (320 Mn), L-50 (420 Mn), L-100 (460 Mn), H-15 (560 Mn), H-25 (610 Mn), H-35 (660 Mn), H-50 (750 Mn), H-100 (920 Mn), H-300 (1290 Mn), L-14E (27-37 cst&commat;100&deg; F. Viscosity), H-300E (635-690 cst&commat;210&deg; F. Viscosity), Actipol E6 (365 Mn), E16 (973 Mn), E23 (1433 Mn), Kraton L-1203, EKP-206, EKP-207, HPVM-2203 and the like. Example of various commercially oils include: Duraprime and Tufflo oils (6006, 6016, 6016M, 6026, 6036, 6056, 6206, etc), other white mineral oils include: Bayol, Bernol, American, Blandol, Drakeol, Ervol, Gloria, Kaydol, Litetek, Lyondell (Duraprime 55,70, 90, 200, 350, 400), Witco white oils including 40 oil, Marcol, Parol, Peneteck, Primol, Protol, Sontex, Petrolia oil, hydrobrite 200 PO, 380 PO, 550 PO, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Generally, plasticizing oils with average molecular weights less than about 50 and to greater than about 2,000 may also be used (e.g. H-300 (1290 Mn)). It is well know that minor and sufficient amounts of Vitamin E is added to the described commercially available oils during bulk processing which is useful as a oil stabilizer, antioxidant, and preservative. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Of all the factors, for example is a gel floss, the amount of plasticizing oils can be controlled and adjusted advantageously to obtain substantially higher tear and tensile strength gels. The improvements in tensile strength of the gels are accompanied by corresponding increase in gel rigidity as the amount of plasticizing oils are lowered until the rigidity of the gels becomes much higher than that of the gums which surround the teeth. Although higher tensile strengths can be obtained as the amount of plasticizing oils in the gel approaches zero, the tensile strength of the floss, however, must be maintained at an acceptable gel rigidity (at sufficient high plasticizing oil levels) in order to be as soft as the gums required for flossing. For example, the rigidities of a gel containing 100, 200, or 300 parts by weight of oil is much higher than a gel containing 300, 400, 500, 600, 800, or 900 parts of oil. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> These gels can exhibit a larger unit lateral contraction at the same elongation per unit of length as their counterpart parent gels from which the new gels are derived or formed. This property would allow a same unit volume of gel when elongated as its parent to easily wedge between the teeth when flossing. It would seem that a gel having the 1.0 cm<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>volume made from a ratio of 100 parts by weight of copolymer and 400 parts plasticizer would have a unique macro volume configurations that is at equilibrium with the plasticizer which is much like a 3-D fingerprint which is uniquely different from any other gel of a different copolymer to plasticizer ratio. Reducing the plasticizer content of a ratio 100:400 gel to a 100:300 ratio of copolymer to plasticizer will decrease the amount of plasticizer, but the original macro volume configurations will remain the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Speculative theories not withstanding, configurations may take the form of (1) swiss cheese, (2) sponge, (3) the insides of a loaf of bread, (4) structures liken to ocean brain corals, (5) large structures and small structures forming the 3-D gel volume landscape, (6) the outer heated surface which cools faster than the inner volumes of the gel during its cooling histories may have a patterned crust (rich in A micro-phases) like that of a loaf of bread and the inner volume may have much like 1-5, and (7) the many different possible structures are unlimited and volume landscapes may be interconnected at the macro-level by threads or micro-strands of Z micro-phases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The ability to make gels with a continuous gradual varying rigidity index without any physical discontinuity boundary is advantageous. For example, it would be desirable to form a gel ball with a higher rigidity on the outer surface to increase wear resistance without first forming a low rigidity gel center and dipping or coating the low rigidity gel ball center with a higher rigidity gel outer layer. In any event, the coating of a higher rigidity outer gel layer onto a lower rigidity softer ball core require additional steps and energy and the outer higher rigidity gel coat can peel off like an outer layer of an onion with a physical discontinuity or physical boundary at which line the two separate gel regions can be peeled apart. The center gel core does not form an integral continuous, boundary less composition with the outer higher rigidity layer no matter how high the bath temperature of higher rigidity gel is heated prior to dipping or coating onto the center gel core. The outer core will always peel off when peeling force is applied at the interface between the outer layer and the gel core. There is no way around this problem. This is also the case for a ball coated with the same rigidity gel. There is no difference if the gel center core is coated on the outside with a lower rigidity, higher rigidity, or even the same rigidity gel, the outer coating will always peel off the ball when a sufficient peeling force is applied at the interface. This is also the case for any gel article of any shape coated with one or more layer of another gel including strands for flossing. The outer layer will always peel off when sufficient peeling force is applied at the gel-gel interface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Therefore it is of great advantage to be able to extract oil from the outer volume or areas of a gel article to improve to increase the volume or area rigidity and its outer surface wear properties and at the same time not creating any internal or external gel-gel peelable interface. It is also of great advantage to be able to reduce, reduce substantially, or extract substantially all the oil from the entire volume of the gel article to reduce or remove the oil volume of any gel article without creating any internal or external gel peelable interfaces thereby creating an entirely new gel article of reduced oil volume or content and article of greater rigidity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In my U.S. Pat. No. 6,148,830, at col. 12, lines 28-54, I describe the advantages of extracting plasticizer from gels. The methods of plasticizer extraction from already formed gels all require the input of additional energy. For example, (1) soxhlet extraction involving solvent exchange require additional electrical and heat energy, (2) pressure-heat extraction require additional electrical and heat energy, (3) vacuum-heat-pressure extraction require additional electrical and heat energy, and (4) vacuum-solvent and vacuum-heat-solvent-pressure extractions also require additional electrical and heat energy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Therefore, it is advantageous to perform extractions of oil from oil gels using very little or no additional energy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The invention is also suitable for extracting to all types of oils and hydrocarbons in any form, such as from extremely high, and high viscosity liquid-liquid hydrocarbon mixtures or liquid-solid hydrocarbon mixtures (for example: crude and other fossil containing liquid hydrocarbons such as tar) utilizing little or no energy is of great advantage. The extraction or separation of selected hydrocarbons from raw crude oil or other hydrocarbon mixtures obtained from under the earth&apos;s surface and performing such extraction to obtain useful hydrocarbon values with little or no energy can realized by the method of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The extraction, separation, and removal of hydrocarbons, especially hydrocarbon oils from oil extended polymer gels and the extraction, separation, and removal of useful hydrocarbon fractions (oils) from high viscosity liquid-liquid and liquid-solid crude mixtures can be obtained by the use of one or more of a liquid, liquid-solid, liquid-solid supported, or solid silicone membrane. The useful membrane can be in the form of (1) one or more silicone fluids of low, moderate, high, or extremely high viscosity, (2) one or more silicone fluids in combination with one or more of a porous substrate, (3) one or more silicone fluids in combination with one or more of a solid silicone membrane, and (4) one or more silicone fluids in combination with one or more of a porous substrate and silicone solid membrane. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The present invention should not be held to any speculative theory. From the experiments and current understanding of viscosity, intermolecular forces of cohesion and adhesion, surface and interfacial tension, density, gravity, and buoyancy, a theory can be made to explain the physics involved in the extraction process which reasoning is as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> (1) When water is placed in contact with an oil extended gel, the gel will not over time exhibit weight loss. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> (2) When oil is add to a column of water in a test tube, the oil will separate out and find its level above the column of water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> (3) The surface tension of water at 25&deg; C. is about 72.0 mN/m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> (4) The surface tension of oil (mineral oil) at 25&deg; C. is about 29.7 mN/m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> (5) The surface tension of silicone fluid at 25&deg; C. range from abut 16 to abut 22 mN/m (for example: the surface tension of 100 cSt silicone fluid at STP is 20.9 mN/m). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> (6) The density of oil is less than the density of silicone fluid, silicone grease, silicone gel, and silicone elastomer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> (7) Oil is not a polar liquid and is highly compatible with the rubber phase of the oil gel forming polymer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> (8) Silicone is polar and not compatible with the polymer&apos;s rubber phase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The molecules of a liquid oil drop attract each other. The interactions of an oil molecule in the liquid oil drop are balanced by an equal attractive force in all directions. Oil molecules on the surface of the liquid oil drop experience an imbalance of forces at the interface with air. The effect is the presence of free energy at the surface. This excess energy is called surface free energy and is quantified as a measurement of energy/area. This can be described as tension or surface tension which is quantified as a force/length measurement or m/Nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Clearly gravity is the only force pulling on the extracted oil from the gel in the presence of silicone fluid at the gel-petri dish interface in the examples below. In the case of gel samples in the petri dishes in contact with silicone fluids, the extracted oil are collected on the top surface layer of the silicone fluid while the silicone fluid maintain constant contact and surrounds the gel sample. In the case of gel placed in a test tube of silicone fluid of different viscosity, the oil is extracted and migrates and collect at the top of the silicone fluid surface while the gel reduces in volume with time. The oil extraction process in silicone is accompanied by buoyant forces removing the extracted oil from the surroundings of the gel constantly surrounding the gel with fresh silicone fluid while in the example of alcohol, since the oil is heavier, the oil is maintained and surrounds the gel sample forming a equilibrium condition of oil surround the gel sample while keeping the alcohol from being in contact with the gel sample. Therefore in order to use alcohol to extract oil from a gel sample, the extracted oil must be constantly removed from the oil alcohol mixture as is the case during soxhlet extraction which process requires additional energy to pump the oil-alcohol mixture away from the sample and removing the oil before forcing the alcohol back to the gel sample surface to perform further extraction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Silicone fluid is efficient and useful for extracting oil form oil gel compositions with the assistance of gravity and buoyancy of oil in the silicone fluids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> It is very difficult to extract, separate, or remove oil from an oil gel composition by positive or vacuum pressure or heat while using little or no energy and because of the affinity of the rubber midblock for oil, not even the weight of a two ton truck resting on a four square foot area (placing a layer of gel between four pairs of one foot square parallel steel plates one set under each of the truck tire resting on the gels) can separate the oil from the gel composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The use of silicone fluids of various viscosity acts as a liquid semi porous membrane when placed in constant contact with an oil gel composition will induce oil to migrate out of the gel composition. By the use of gravity or oil buoyancy, no energy is required run the oil extraction process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In the case of an oil extended polymer, say in the shape of an oil gel ball as describe in SEEPS Example 16, the rubber being highly compatible with the oil, holds the oil in place within the boundary of the rubber molecular phase. It is this affinity of the (1) rubber and oil molecules and (2) the attraction of oil molecules for each other that prevents the oil from bleeding out of the surface of the oil extended polymer ball. There exist then, at the surface of the oil extended polymer ball several types of surface tensions of: (1) oil-air surface tension, (2) oil-rubber surface tension, (3) rubber-air surface tension, (4) rubber/oil-air surface tension, and (5) rubber-rubber surface tension. Other forces acting on the oil extended polymer ball are: the elastic force of the polymer network pulling inwards, similar to stretched out rubber bands, which is in equilibrium with the oil molecules&apos; attraction to the rubber molecules of the polymer network. In the case of SBS, the lower compatibility of the midblock butadiene with oil, once the ball is made, the SBS network immediately contracts due to elastic forces to produce oil bleeding which is evidence of the poor compatibility of the rubber block for the oil molecules. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The intermolecular forces that bind similar molecules together are called cohesive forces. Intermolecular forces that bind a substance to a surface are called adhesive forces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> When two liquids are in contact such as oil and silicone fluid, there is interfacial tension. The more dense fluid is referred to herein as the &ldquo;heavy phase&rdquo; and the less dense fluid is referred to as the &ldquo;light phase&rdquo;. The action at the surface of the oil extended polymer gel surface when brought into contact with silicone fluid is as follows: a drop of silicone fluid when placed on the flat surface of a oil extended polymer gel will wet the gel surface and spread over a larger area as compared to a drop of oil placed on the same gel surface. Because the surface free energy of the silicone fluid in contact with the gel surface is lower than the surface free energy of the oil, the silicone fluid has the ability to displaces the oil from the surface of the gel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> A thermoplastic oil gel composite article comprising a gel with at two or more rigidity regions can be made by the method of the invention, said gel rigidity regions having no physically separable boundaries, wherein said gel is being denoted by G, is physically interlocked with a selected material M or in combination with one or more of a different gel forming a composite of the combination GnGn, GnGnGn, GnMn, GnMnGn, MnGnMn, MnGnGn, MnMnMnGnMn, MnGnGnMn, GnMnGnGn, GnGnMnMn, GnMnMnGn, GnGnMnGnMnGnGn, GnMnGnMnMn, MnGnMnGnMnGn, GnGnMnMnGn, GnGnMnGnMn, GnGnMnGnMnGn, GnMnGnMnGn, MnMnMnGn or a permutation of one or more of said Gn with Mn; wherein when n is a subscript of M, n is the same or different selected from the group consisting of paper, foam, plastic, fabric, metal, metal foil, concrete, wood, glass, glass fibers, ceramics, synthetic resin, synthetic fibers or refractory materials; and wherein when n is a subscript of G, n denotes a different gel rigidity. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Buoyancy can be use to Advantage </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Further, because the silicone fluid phase is heavier than the oil phase, the lighter oil phase is remove from the surface of the gel because of buoyancy and is transported away and above the heavier silicone fluid line level. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Gravity can be use to Advantage </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> A highly viscous silicone fluid can be use to advantage. When the bulk amount of the high viscosity silicone fluid is too great to allow the oil molecules to migrate across then, the removal and transport of the oil away from the surface of the gel is slowed so as to form an equilibrium of oil-silicone fluid at the gel surface. A thin coat of a high viscosity silicone fluid appears to work best to provide for removal and transport of the oil away from the surface of the oil extended polymer gel surface by gravity. Such a lightly coated polymer gel surface will drip oil when held vertically above a collecting container or when placed on an inclined position, oil will run downward from the gel-container surface interface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The present invention is useful for making gel articles which are designed to have a soft, lower rigidity interior and a tough or higher rigidity thick exterior volume or a higher rigidity thin exterior skin.

<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The teachings of the invention can also apply to the extraction of selected hydrocarbons from (1) liquid-liquid organic mixtures, (2) liquid solid organic mixtures, (3) liquid solid organic/inorganic mixtures, (4) hydrocarbon-polymer gel mixtures, and (5) when said (1)-(4) mixtures are in a vapor-liquid, a vapor-solid, or a vapor-liquid-gel state; said hydrocarbon extractions of mixtures (1) through (5) can be performed using very little or no energy.

The extracted oil from the gel sample was observed suspended below the alcohol fluid level in the test tube after the gel sample was removed. The gel rigidity of the resultant gel appears to be somewhat uniform apparently because the extracted oil surrounds the sample while the alcohol is displaced by the extracted oil to the top portion of the test tube. The extraction of oil from the gel is slowed and frustrated because the extracted oil is not transported away from the vicinity of the gel body and because the oil is denser than alcohol, the oil comes to equilibrium at both the alcohol-oil interface and the free oil-bounded oil gel interface. </paragraph>

The extracted oil is observed to continually run down the incline at one of the corner of each of the gel cube resting on the petri dish surface unto the vertical wall of the petri dish container where the oil collects. The interface where the cubes rests on the petri dish&apos;s surface appear to be contain a layer of silicone fluid. Observing from the under side of the petri dish, silicone fluid appears to be maintained under the gel cube samples due to capillary action while oil appear to drool from the corner and edge of the bottom surface of the gel cubes. </paragraph>
