<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a system and method for wireless communications and in particular to a system and method for person-to-person messaging with a value-added service. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND INFORMATION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The explosive growth of the cell phone industry over the past several years has forced cell phone manufacturers to continually offer new and improved services with each generation of new cell phones. New services such as call waiting, caller ID, three-way calling, call forwarding, and voice dialing have become standard in the newer generation cell phones. In addition, the popularity of the Internet and the ease with which users can obtain and share information over the Internet have created new areas for growth. Given the pervasiveness of the Internet in our everyday lives, it is understandable why there is a great demand to access the Internet via a wireless device such as a cell phone. Many currently available cell phones and other wireless devices are equipped with browser software (often called &ldquo;microbrowsers&rdquo;) that enables the wireless devices to access hypermedia content on the Internet. However, many earlier generation wireless devices are not equipped with microbrowsers. The lack of a microbrowser restricts the ability of such devices to access hypermedia content on the Internet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Limited Internet access has been provided to such wireless devices using a service known as Short Message Service (&ldquo;SMS&rdquo;), which is available on many such devices. SMS allows users of certain wireless devices to send and receive alphanumeric messages of limited length (e.g., up to 160 characters). SMS is similar to paging, however, SMS does not require that the wireless device be active and within range when a message is sent. If a wireless device is either inactive or out of range, the SMS message generally is held for a period of time until the wireless device either returns to active status or is within range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> SMS-based Internet access is primarily performed by a submission of one or more &ldquo;keyword&rdquo; messages from the wireless device to a predetermined address or telephone number serviced by a server. The server prepares an SMS message that includes the information based on the &ldquo;keyword&rdquo; and delivers the SMS message back to the requesting wireless device. An example of this type of access would be a request for a stock quote. The wireless user would enter the keyword &ldquo;QUOTE&rdquo; followed by the stock symbol. A server would receive the SMS message and the server would have to decode the keyword and attempt to obtain appropriate information requested by the wireless device. Once the quote value was determined, the server would create an SMS message containing the corresponding quote information and forward it to the requesting wireless device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Wireless devices operate on several different standards throughout the world. The United States, for example, uses a digital cellular system based on a IS-95 and CDMA 2000 standard. Code Division Multiple Access (&ldquo;CDMA&rdquo;) allows many users to share a common frequency/time channel for transmission by spreading the individual call signals with different codes. Likewise, the European community utilizes a system known as the Global System for Mobile Communications (&ldquo;GSM&rdquo;). GSM is based upon a Time Division Multiple Access (&ldquo;TDMA&rdquo;) and a Frequency Division Multiple Access (&ldquo;FDMA&rdquo;) standard. Unlike CDMA, each user is given either a temporal or frequency slot to transmit their data. Both CDMA 2000 and the GSM systems utilize separated channels for transmitting data. These channels can be mixed for higher capacity throughput if needed. In addition, the channels can be either traffic channels or control channels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The SMS messaging service is typically carried on a Standalone Dedicated Control Channel (&ldquo;SDCCH&rdquo;) in a GSM operating environment. The SDCCH channel operates independently of traffic channels (&ldquo;TCHs&rdquo;). Therefore, users of the cell phones may receive SMS messages while simultaneously carrying on a conversation with another user or transmitting data over the TCHs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The SMS text messaging service handles almost <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> billion character-based messages per month worldwide. Given this enormous popularity, a new and revolutionary way of sending messages was developed that enhanced the already popular SMS. The Multi Media SMS Message (&ldquo;MMS&rdquo;) service can transmit messages containing text, graphics, photographic images, audio and even video clips between mobile devices using Wireless Application Protocol (&ldquo;WAP&rdquo;) and powered by new high-speed transmission technologies such as Enhanced Data rate for GSM Evolution (&ldquo;EDGE&rdquo;) and General Packet Radio Service (&ldquo;GPRS&rdquo;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Currently, sending either a SMS or MMS message from one wireless device to another requires an originating wireless device to upload the message and attached content to a central location and then have the central location download the message and attached content to a terminating wireless device. This process has several disadvantages. First, video, image and sound files may be quite large in terms of data, and according to this process, large amounts of data are required to be uploaded and downloaded. This reduces the number of cells that can be carried for a given area. In addition, the above process requires that the originating wireless device store the large data files either in main memory of the cell phone or on a Subscriber Identity Module (&ldquo;SIM&rdquo;). Cell phone memory comes at a premium, therefore, storing large amounts of needless data is an inefficient use of memory resources. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The sending of image, sound and video data as well as goods and services (flowers, candy, telephones, etc.) is referred to as value-added services. These value-added services are sent using the SMS and MMS services. Unfortunately, there is no system or method to efficiently handle the transmission of such services. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, there remains a need for a system and method for person-to-person messaging with a value-added service that reduces the amount of data transmitted between wireless devices. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The above-identified problems are solved and a technical advance is achieved in the art by providing a system and method for person-to-person messaging with a value-added service. In a preferred embodiment, the system is comprised of a message server connected to a Short Message Service Center (&ldquo;SMSC&rdquo;) and the Internet. The SMSC is connected to a SMS Gateway Mobile Switching Center (&ldquo;SMS GMSC&rdquo;). The SMSC may also be connected to a database containing Mobile Station ISDN (&ldquo;MSISDN&rdquo;) information and corresponding advertising information. The SMS GMSC is connected to a Mobile Switching Center (&ldquo;MSC&rdquo;) which in turn is connected to a Base Station System (&ldquo;BSS&rdquo;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the method for person-to-person messaging with a value-added service entails the production of a SMS or MMS message having Uniform Resource Locators (&ldquo;URLs&rdquo;) and/or Uniform Resource Identifiers (&ldquo;URIs&rdquo;), which are hereinafter referred to interchangeably as URLs. The message also contains a MSISDN that corresponds to the terminating wireless device. The MSISDN is the mobile station ISDN number of the terminating wireless device. The format of the MSISDN varies depending upon country location, but, in the United States, it is typically the country code and a phone number. The URL data refers to the address of a file (resource) accessible on the Internet. The SMS or MMS is forwarded to the BSS, the MSC, and the SMS GMSC. The SMS GMSC forwards the message to the SMSC for processing. There, a message server extracts the enclosed URL, obtains the information via the Internet, creates an enhanced message and forwards the enhanced message to the MSISDN of the terminating MS. The enhanced message includes the data and/or services located at the particular URL. In addition, since the MSISDN of the terminating MS is known, the server can access a database that contains advertising information based upon individual MSISDN numbers, attach the advertising message to the enhanced message, and broadcast the enhanced message to the terminating MS.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the drawings, in which similar reference characters denote similar or identical elements throughout the several views, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates a network environment in which a wireless device may be used for person-to-person messaging with a value-added service according to one embodiment of the present invention. The system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is comprised of an originating mobile station <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> and a terminating mobile station <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. Originating mobile station <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> generates a short message <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> that is wirelessly transmitted to a Base Station System (&ldquo;BSS&rdquo;) using the Global System for Mobile Communications (&ldquo;GSM&rdquo;) network. The short message <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is received via a Mobile Switching Center (&ldquo;MSC&rdquo;) and is forwarded to a SMS GMSC gateway mobile switching center. The SMSC receives short message <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> from the SMS GMSC and processes it using a message server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The message server in a preferred embodiment of the present invention is connected to the SMSC. However, in an equally functional alternate embodiment, the message server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be run as a software application or separate hardware on the SMSC. In addition, it is understood that the present invention may be incorporated into other standards having SMS-like services. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, short message <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> contains a message header and a message body. The message header may contain address information identifying where the message should be sent. The message body contains a MSISDN number of a terminating MS and URL data in the body of short message <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The header contains the address information directing the short message to the SMSC. The MSISDN refers to the ISDN number of the terminating wireless device. The URL refers to the address of the data (resource) accessible on the Internet. Message server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is connected to the Internet through a high-speed connection. Message server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> extracts the URL from short message <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, accesses the Internet and obtains the Internet content located at the URL. Message server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> then creates an enhanced message <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> that is comprised of a retrieved data field <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> containing the retrieved data and a MSISDN field. In addition, enhanced message <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> may contain a text data field <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> and an advertisement data field <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Short message <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> contains the MSISDN number of the terminating MS <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. It is therefore possible to send an advertisement to terminating MS <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. In addition, since the identity of the terminating MS is known, an advertising database <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, connected to server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, can provide advertisements that are tailored to the personal interests of MS <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. Message server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> can access advertisement database <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, match the MSISDN with one of a plurality of records in the database <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, and attach advertisement data to advertisement data field <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> of the enhanced message <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. The enhanced message <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is then forwarded by SMSC <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> to the terminating MS <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> via SMS GMSC, MSC and BSS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Sending a short message <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> in this manner reduces the amount of air interface traffic and bandwidth requirements because originating MS <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is not required to download the information located at the URL location contained in short message <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Therefore, short message <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> contains a minimal amount of data thereby reducing the amount of air interface traffic and bandwidth resources required to transmit the short message <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Message server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is connected to the Internet using a high speed Internet backbone and therefore efficiently retrieves the information requested. The information retrieved by message server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be any type of data including but not limited to video data, image data, text data, audio data, and/or goods/services. The retrieved data <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> along with optional text data <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> and optional advertisement data <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> is broadcast to the terminating MS <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> and thereby reduces the amount of air interface usage and bandwidth resources required by almost fifty percent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> While this embodiment has been described using an originating MS <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, it is understood that a personal computer <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> may also create and forward a short message <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> either wirelessly through BSS or directly to the SMSC <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. In addition, it is understood that SMSC <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> may also be a MMSC. These two terms may be used interchangeably throughout this application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, there is shown a block diagram of an exemplary wireless device for use with an embodiment of the present invention. The wireless device of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> may be either or both the originating MS <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> and the terminating MS <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. The wireless device is comprised of a display <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, a plurality of keys <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, and a central processing unit <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. In addition, the wireless device may contain a memory <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and a Subscriber Identity Module (&ldquo;SIM&rdquo;). Memory <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and SIM <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> provide temporary storage for CPU <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. A speaker <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, a microphone <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight>, and an antenna <highlight><bold>275</bold></highlight> are also provided in the wireless device. The wireless device of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is equipped with a web browser <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> for viewing hypertext media content from the Internet, a SMS editor <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> for creating short message <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, and a media editor <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> for creating, displaying and editing MMS messages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a block diagram of an exemplary message server of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Message server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is comprised of a processor <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>, a SMSC interface <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>, and an Internet interface <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> interconnected via a system bus <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. The SMSC interface <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> is connected to SMSC <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> via an SMSC link <highlight><bold>385</bold></highlight>. In addition, an input device <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> and an output device <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> provide input and output data capabilities. Internet interface <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> is connected to the Internet via a high-speed backbone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Processor <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> obtains short message <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> from SMSC <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> via SMSC interface <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> and the system bus <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. The URL and MSISDN are extracted from short message <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> by the processor <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>. The URL is utilized by Internet interface <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> to obtain the information designated by the URL from the Internet. This information is then stored in a memory <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> or a mass storage device <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, which is connected to system bus <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. After the information is retrieved, processor <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> creates enhanced message <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and stores the retrieved data in retrieved data field <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. The extracted MSISDN information is stored in MSISDN field <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> of enhanced message <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. This enhanced message <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> may then be forwarded to terminating MS <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> via SMS GMSC, the MSC, and the base station subsystem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Processor <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> may also add advertising data to enhanced message <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> prior to sending enhanced message <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> to the SMS GMSC. The process of attaching advertisement information to the enhanced message <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is accomplished by comparing the MSISDN data from short message <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> with a plurality of records <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> located within advertisement database <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. The plurality of records of advertisement database <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> each include a MSISDN data field <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, and a preference data field <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> that contains advertising relating to an area of interest for the corresponding MSISDN. Records <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> may also contain a shipping address field <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> containing a shipping address relating to the terminating wireless device. Once a successful match is made of the MSISDN, the accompanying advertisements stored in the preference data field of a matching record of advertisement database <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> are stored in the advertisement field <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> of enhanced message <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In this manner, it is possible to provide advertisements that are tailored to the personal preference of the terminating MS <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. For example, if terminating MS <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> indicates that the user&apos;s interests include shopping, camping and sports, the preference data field may contain brief messages directed to these interests. It is understood that the preference data field may contain a plurality of records each containing individual advertisement messages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates a flow diagram of an exemplary method for person-to-person messaging with a value-added service according to an embodiment of the present invention. Step <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> creates SMS message <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> containing a MSISDN and a URL in the body of the message. Originating MS <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> then sends short message <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to SMSC in step <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. Step <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> determines whether or not the format of the short message <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is correct. For example, the URL address should contain certain characters such as &ldquo;www&rdquo; identifying the World Wide Web, and an appropriate suffix such as .com, .org, .edu, .gov, etc. If the address is correct, step <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> creates an enhanced message <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> using the information contained in short message <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and step <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> sends the enhanced message <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> to terminating MS <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. If step <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> determines that the format is not correct, step <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> sends an error message to the originating MS <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> indicating what is wrong with the format and ends the procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates a flow diagram for creating SMS message according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Step <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> opens SMS editor <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> while step <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> prompts the user of originating MS <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> to enter the MSISDN of terminating MS <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> in the body of the short message <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The MSISDN is the ISDN number of the MS. For GSM systems deployed in Europe and Asia, the MSISDN consists of a country code (&ldquo;CC&rdquo;), national designation code (&ldquo;NDC&rdquo;), and subscriber number (&ldquo;SN&rdquo;). The SN is the address to the serving MSC. For systems in the United States, the MSISDN number follows the North American Number Plan (&ldquo;NANP&rdquo;) format. The NANP format consists of the CC, a three-digit number planning area (&ldquo;NPA&rdquo;) code plus a seven-digit SN code. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Step <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> prompts the user to enter a URL pointing to the desired content on the Internet into the body of short message <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Step <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> determines whether the MSISDN and URL information is in an acceptable format. If not, step <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> requests additional information and returns to step <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> to prompt the user to enter a corrected MSISDN or corrected URL. If step <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> determines that the format is correct, the procedure ends. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a flow diagram illustrating an exemplary method for creating an enhanced message by the message server according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Step <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> extracts the MSISDN and URL information from the SMS short message <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Step <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> then creates the enhanced message and addresses it to the MSISDN of the terminating MS <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. Step <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> obtains the Internet content pointed to by the URL contained in the short message <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. This retrieved content may be stored in memory device <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> attached to the message server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> or in mass storage device <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. Step <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight> determines whether or not the addition of advertising is authorized. If not, the procedure ends. If advertising is authorized, step <highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight> obtains the MSISDN of the terminating MS <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> from short message <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Step <highlight><bold>650</bold></highlight> accesses advertisement database <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and obtains an appropriate advertising message from the preference data field corresponding to the MSISDN of the terminating MS <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. Step <highlight><bold>660</bold></highlight> then adds the advertising message to the enhanced message <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> in advertising field <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> and the procedure ends. During the course of the relationship between the cellular service provider and the wireless device user, certain information is requested and or obtained that identifies various likes and dislikes of the wireless user. For example, shopping records of the user may indicate that the user is a frequent purchaser of sports equipment or accesses financial information on a regular basis. Accordingly, the advertisement database <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> stores advertisement massages that are directed to those interests in the preference data field of the corresponding MSISDN. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a flow diagram illustrating an exemplary method for obtaining content from a URL according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. Step <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> determines whether or not the URL is directed to a service or data. If the URL is directed to data, such as voice data, video data, sound data, or text data, step <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> then retrieves the appropriate data. Step <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight> then adds the retrieved data to the retrieved content field <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> of enhanced message <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and the procedure ends. If step <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> determines that the URL is directed to a service, step <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight> determines whether or not the service is authorized. If the service has not been authorized, step <highlight><bold>735</bold></highlight> adds an error message to text field <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> of enhanced message <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> If step <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight> determines that the service is authorized, step <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight> then obtains shipping address information <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> from the MSISDN of the terminating MS <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. This shipping address information <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> may be stored in database <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Once a shipping address information is obtained in step <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight>, step <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight> sends the goods or authorized services to the shipping address of terminating MS <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> and the procedure ends. Where the service request is one that is used by the terminating MS <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, shipping address is not required. For example, if a gift of additional paid airtime or an enhanced wireless feature such as call forwarding is paid for as a gift by the originating MS <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, the service may be broadcast to the terminating MS <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> without the need for a shipping address. In this example, server generates and sends an authorization code that enables the terminating device <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> to perform the paid for additional service. The authorization code may be stored in the SIM of the terminating SM. </paragraph>
