<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates in general to an automated execution system for trading products such as securities, commodities, or derivatives. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Participants typically use markets to facilitate the exchange of products and services. Exchanges or trading facilities assist in developing the organizational structure of the markets to meet the needs of participants, other traders, and the economic society as a whole. For instance, securities or derivatives are exemplary types of products that are traded publicly at many of the trading facilities throughout the world. A type of security or derivative, referred to generally as &ldquo;options,&rdquo; convey certain rights to buy or sell an underlying asset, stock, commodity, or other security at a fixed price for a specific period of time, until expiration for an American-style option or at expiration for a European-style option. Currently, all options that trade on U.S. securities exchanges are issued, guaranteed, and cleared by the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC). OCC is a registered clearing corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). SEC is a government commission created by Congress to regulate the U.S. securities exchanges and protect investors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> According to the above example, participants such as members of the trading facilities can trade options by submitting agency buy and sell orders to a trading facility, referred to as &ldquo;order flow.&rdquo; Opposite to the buy and sell orders are typically market makers, specialists, or designated primary market makers (DPMs). Market makers provide liquidity in securities trading by risking their own capital for proprietary trading. Specialists and DPMs are similar to market makers except that they are allowed to represent orders from the public or participants, and may have other additional obligations and participation rights. Although market makers, specialists, or designated primary market makers (DPMs) can play different roles in the trading process they will be collectively referred to hereinafter as &ldquo;market makers.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Typically, participants and market makers can trade their products at a trading facility by open outcry. However, trading facilities are also utilizing current technology to develop electronic trading systems. In an exemplary electronic trading system a participant submits buy and sell orders for automatic execution at an exchange or trading facility. For example, logged-on market makers can be made eligible to trade the incoming orders. In this example, once the electronic trading begins the market maker quotes are typically recorded in the automated and computer-based trading system, and matched up automatically with orders that enter the execution system electronically. However, unlike manual-style trading, this exemplary trading system and other electronic or automatic trading systems do not allow a participant to participate in trades resulting from their own generated order flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Thus, there is a need for an electronic or automatic execution system that enables participants who submit buy orders or sell orders or both to participate in trades resulting from that order flow. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A method and system for allowing a participant to participate in their generated order flow is provided. The method and system can automatically assign a stated percentage of the contra-side of each customer order to the participant that submitted the order flow without affecting the price of execution to the customer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In an aspect of the present embodiment, a method of trading securities or derivatives over an automated execution system is provided. A participant submits an electronic order on behalf of a customer into the automated execution system. A portion of the electronic order volume is executed against the participant, and the remaining portion of the electronic order volume is executed against participating market makers by the automated execution system. In an exemplary embodiment, the customer preferably receives each execution at the National Best Bid or Offer thereby allowing the customer to receive the best available price at the time of execution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In another aspect of the present embodiment, an order routing system forwards a participant&apos;s electronic order to an automated execution system that includes a firm participation subsystem. The firm participation subsystem automatically executes a portion of the electronic order volume against the participant. The remaining portion of the electronic order volume is sent to the market maker subsystem for execution. In the exemplary embodiment, a book process system is utilized to determine if the incoming electronic order can be executed against an order resting in the book at the prevailing market price, and if so, the order is executed against the resting order. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The present embodiments provide a participant with the ability to participate in their own generated order flow while preferably assuring customer executions at the National Best Bid or Offer. A participant such as a broker or firm may submit buy and sell orders for their customer to an automated execution system. The automated execution system then enables the participant to desirably participate on the contra-side of the trades resulting from that order flow. Therefore, by allowing a participant that generates order flow to participate in their generated order flow, exchanges or trading facilities may meet the needs of the participants, market makers, and other others impacted by the markets. Moreover, exchanges or trading facilities can desirably attract participants to their respective automated execution system. Additionally, the present embodiments would preferably not alter or affect the price at which the customers&apos; orders receives an execution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The foregoing and other objects, features and advantages of the automated execution system having firm participation will be apparent from the following more particular description of preferred embodiments as illustrated in the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The exemplary embodiments disclose a system and method for allowing a participant that submits customer order flow to participate in a stated percentage of the generated order flow, preferably without affecting the price of execution to the customer. The exemplary embodiments have been implemented in an electronic trading system that includes an automatic execution system. More specifically, the exemplary embodiments have been implemented on an automatic execution system that facilitates trading of option contracts. It should be understood, however, that the present embodiments may be utilized in other electronic execution or trading systems that trade commodities, derivatives or securities of any type including, without limitation, any note, equity or index option, exchange traded fund, warrant, stock, treasury stock, bond, future, debenture, certificate of interest or participation in any profit-sharing agreement or in a firm. Therefore, details regarding the electronic trading system, the automatic execution system, and the types of products traded are provided as an example, and are not necessary to the invention unless otherwise specified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a block diagram of an electronic trading system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> that utilizes the automatic execution system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of the exemplary embodiment. The electronic trading system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> generally includes at least one participant&apos;s electronic order <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, order routing system <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, and automatic execution system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The automatic execution system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> facilitates the trading of option contracts and preferably allows a participant that submits an electronic order <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to participate in a stated percentage of the electronic order, described more below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Participants include any person or entity who has access to the electronic trading system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, such as a registered member and their corresponding firm, broker/dealer, etc. Preferably, the participant submits their customers&apos; electronic order <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, in the form of a buy or sell order, electronically to the order routing system <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> via a wired or wireless network (not shown). The customer includes the client of the participant such as, for example, an international bank, farmer, business person, homemaker, and so on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The electronic order <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is preferably submitted through a user device such as a personal computer, laptop, telephone, hand-held terminal, personal digital assistant, and so forth. For example, a participant in communication with the order routing system <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> might submit orders electronically from their branch or office, or order desk to the order routing system <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. Moreover, orders phoned to the securities exchange&apos;s floor, or wired to a participant&apos;s own house printer can be re-entered into the order routing system <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> by the participant&apos;s booth staff. In any event, the electronic order <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is submitted and transmitted over a wired or wireless network to the order routing system <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the order routing system <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> provides the participant a method of efficiently delivering the electronic order <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to a securities exchange, such as at the Chicago Board Options Exchange located in Chicago, Ill. Upon receipt of the electronic order <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> at the order routing system <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, the order <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is preferably logged to a database and evaluated, based on order volume (i.e., the number of option contracts in the electronic order <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>) and price, to determine its appropriate routing destination such as the automated execution system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. However, before the order routing system <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> routes the electronic order <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, it preferably uses pre-defined guidelines to determine if the electronic order <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is eligible for execution at the automated execution system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Exemplary guidelines used to determine the eligibility of the electronic order <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> can include price, volume, and series guidelines. According to the price guideline, the electronic order <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is eligible when the order is either a simple market order, an order that can be executed at the prevailing market price, or a marketable limit order, referred to as an order to buy or sell option contracts at a specified price or better. According to the volume guideline, the electronic order <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is eligible if the contract size of the order is within the limits set for the class and series (e.g., 10 contracts or fewer). Of course, the order routing system <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> can utilize more or fewer guidelines. Also, the guidelines utilized by the order routing system <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> can change from those exemplary guidelines described above depending on the desired eligibility requirements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> An eligible electronic order <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is then forwarded to the automated execution system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> for execution. In the exemplary embodiment, the automated execution system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> generally includes a book process subsystem <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, firm participation subsystem <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, and market maker subsystem <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. Although the automated execution system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> can include more or fewer subsystems, the firm participation subsystem <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is preferably utilized to enable a participant to participate in a stated percentage of each electronic order <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> they submit for execution through the automated execution system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Therefore, each participant that submits order flow <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to the automated execution system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> might be entitled to participate in a stated percentage (e.g., between 0 and 100%) for that electronic order <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, without affecting the price of execution to the customer. If there is a remaining portion of the electronic order <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, then the balance of the order <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> would be allocated pursuant to another subsystem such as the market maker subsystem <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, if so desired, to execute or fill the remaining portion of the electronic order <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Thus, according to the exemplary embodiment, assume a stated percentage or firm participation percentage of 20%. Then, if a participant directs a <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> option contract order to the automated execution system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, the participant would receive an allocation of <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> option contracts (i.e., 20% of 50 option contracts&equals;10 option contracts) while the remaining portion of 40 option contracts would preferably be allocated to the market maker subsystem <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In addition to the firm participation and market maker subsystems <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> respectively, a book process subsystem <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is preferably utilized to determine if the participant&apos;s electronic order <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> can be executed against the book at the prevailing market price. The book process subsystem <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> preferably aids in protecting the priority of electronic orders in the book. Therefore, the electronic order <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is subject to resting orders in the book before it becomes subject to the firm participation and market maker subsystems <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> According to an exemplary embodiment, orders received at the book process subsystem <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> preferably trade before any other subsystems <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> can trade at that price. Thus, to maintain book priority, the automated execution system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> executes an electronic order in the book process subsystem <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> when the book contains a resting order which matches the market quote. For example, if the book has a SELL order matching the market OFFER, a BUY order would be executed at the book process subsystem <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> up to the quantity available in the book. Furthermore, if the book contains a BUY order which matches the market BID, a SELL order would execute at the book process subsystem <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> up to the quantity available in the book. These orders (i.e., BUY or SELL) route to the book process subsystem <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> for automatic execution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> To provide an exemplary illustration, assume that a customer limit order in the book represents the best bid (OFFER) at which a book process subsystem <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> order would be filled. Consequently, any incoming order would be filled up to the quantity available in the book pursuant to book procedures. The remaining order, if any, would then be forwarded to the firm participation subsystem <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Therefore, to provide a numerical example, assume that a customer order to sell 40 contracts is represented in the book and a participant submits a market order to buy 50 contracts, the customer order in the book would receive full execution of the order for 40 contracts. Then 10 to option contracts (50 buy option contracts&minus;40 executed option contracts 10 buy option contracts) would remain and are forwarded to the firm participation subsystem <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The firm participation subsystem <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> receives the electronic order <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and determines if the participant is participating in the order. If not, the order is transferred to the market maker subsystem <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> for further execution. If so, a stated percentage of the remaining order volume is executed against the participant. Therefore, the firm participation subsystem <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> can automatically assign a stated percentage of the contra-side of each order to the participant that sent the order in. If any portion of the order is filled at the firm participation subsystem <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> a filled report is generated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> If there is remaining order volume, it is sent to the market maker subsystem <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> According to the earlier numerical example, 10 option contracts (e.g., 50 buy option contracts&minus;40 executed option contracts&equals;10 buy option contracts) are forwarded from the book process subsystem <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> to the firm participation subsystem <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. With an exemplary firm participation percentage of 20%, the participant would then be entitled to participate in 20% of the remaining order, or 2 option contracts (e.g., 20% of 10 option contracts&equals;2 option contracts). The remaining 8 option contracts would then be forwarded to market maker subsystem <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> for execution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The market maker subsystem <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> receives the remaining order volume, if any, and attempts to execute the trades until the electronic order is filled. The market maker subsystem <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> preferably executes an electronic order against the next available market maker on an automated execution &ldquo;wheel&rdquo;. The wheel is a rotating list of eligible market makers including DPMs that are providing liquidity for marketable orders. If any portion of the order is filled, then a fill report is generated. If there is remaining order volume, it is sent back through the market maker subsystem <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> for further execution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the diagram illustrates in general the overall system and method of the electronic trading system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, however, it should be understood that more or fewer systems or subsystems may be used while remaining within the scope of the present invention. For example, the electronic order <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> could be transmitted directly to the automated execution system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and therefore bypass the order routing system <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, if so desired. Moreover, the book process subsystem <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and market maker subsystem <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, although desirable, are not essential to the automatic execution system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, it would be appreciated by those skilled in the art that other known subsystems, if desirable, may be substituted in place of these described subsystems <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a diagram that illustrates an exemplary implementation of the electronic trading system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The server <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> running the order routing system <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> communicates with a plurality of remote terminals such as device <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, or for example, a personal computer. Other devices can be utilized to submit the electronic order <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> such as a laptop, telephone, hand-held terminal, personal digital assistant, and so forth. The electronic order <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is preferably submitted by a participant through the device <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> over a wired or wireless network <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> to the server <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>. The server <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> is preferably located at the securities exchange and is in communication with a server <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> that runs the automatic execution subsystem <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The order routing system <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> preferably routes the electronic order <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to server <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> to execute the electronic order <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> at automatic execution system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The server <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> that runs the automatic execution system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> preferably runs the application software for the firm participation subsystem <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, book process subsystem <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, and market maker subsystem <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. However, if so desired, the application for each subsystem can be operated on separate servers. Also, the order routing system <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and automatic execution system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> may be hosted on the same server, if so desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</cross-reference>, an example is shown for illustrating the execution process of the electronic execution system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The illustration utilizes a specific example for purposes of demonstrating the process of execution. Therefore, it should be understood that the present embodiment is not limited to this specific example. Accordingly, assume that a book price commitment parameter is set at 10 (i.e., 10 contracts at a minimum are available at the disseminated quote). Also assume that the firm participation percentage is set at 20%. The disseminated quote is at 5.00-5.10. There is a book order to sell 5 contracts at 5.10. This electronic order might then be executed in the electronic trading system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, a participant transmits an electronic order to buy 50 option contracts at the market, presently at 5.00-5.10. The electronic order to buy 50 option contracts is received at the order routing system <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, the order routing system <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> determines if the electronic order is eligible to participate in the automatic execution system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Guidelines may be put in place to prevent ineligible orders from entering the automated execution system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. If the order is found ineligible, the electronic order is forwarded through the order routing system <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> to another subsystem for execution per step <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. If the electronic order is eligible to participate in the automated execution system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, it is forwarded to the book process subsystem <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. For this example, assume that the electronic order to buy 50 option contracts is eligible for execution through the automated execution system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, the book process subsystem <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> determines if a customer order is resting in the book at the prevailing market price. In this example, the market price is currently set at 5.00-5.10. If a customer order is not found in the book at the prevailing market price, the electronic order would be forwarded to the firm participation subsystem <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. However, there is a customer or book order willing to sell 5 option contracts at 5.10. So, yes there is a customer book order at the market value of 5.10. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, the book process subsystem <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> executes the 5 option contracts against the book order at 5.10. Then, the electronic order has an order volume of 45 contracts (50 buy option contracts&minus;5 executed option contracts&equals;45 buy option contracts). The book process subsystem <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> identifies executed and filled order volume. In this example, 5 option contracts have been executed and 45 option contracts remain. The executed volume is transmitted to the report filled order process per step <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> and the remaining order volume is transmitted to the firm participation subsystem <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>, the firm participation subsystem <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> receives the remaining 45 option contracts and determines if the participant is participating in the order. Earlier in this example, it was assumed that participant is participating in the order and that the firm participation percentage is set at 20%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>, the firm participation subsystem <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> executes the firm participation percentage or 20% of the remaining order against the participant. Therefore, the participant will receive 20% of the 45 option contracts or 9 option contracts on the contra-side of the order. Thus, for example, the participant would automatically receive 9 option contracts executed at a price of 5.10 in their firm proprietary account. The remaining portion of the order is 36 option contracts (45 buy option contracts&minus;assigned to participant 9 option contracts&equals;36 buy option contracts). The executed volume is transmitted to the report filled order process per step <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>) and the remaining order volume is transmitted to the market maker subsystem <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. According to this example, the order is not yet filled. In fact, 36 buy option contracts remain. Therefore, the remaining order of 36 option contracts is transmitted to the market maker subsystem <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> to execute the remaining order. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>, the market maker subsystem <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> executes the remaining order against the market makers logged on to the market maker subsystem <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. In this example, the remaining order of 36 buy option contracts is executed at 5.10. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> When the order is filled, then per step <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A, a</cross-reference> fill report is preferably generated. In this example, the order has been filled, so a fill report is generated and distributed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> A participant report can also be generated. The fill report can be distributed to the participant to document the trade for each subsystem <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> if so desired. In addition, the report can be distributed to the market maker to document the transaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> A more detailed example would include an automatic market quote updating system such as given by BestQuote of the Chicago Board Options Exchange of Chicago, Ill. As known in the art, the BestQuote system determines the exchange&apos;s best quote based off electronic inputs. Such electronic inputs could include the current market quote, orders resting in the book, or any manual quotes given by market makers or participants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is used to illustrate another exemplary execution process of the electronic trading system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> using Best Quote in addition to the market value. Similar to the example illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</cross-reference>, the flowchart in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> pertains to a specific example for purposes of demonstrating another example of the process shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Therefore, it should be understood that the present embodiment is not limited to this specific example. It might be helpful to utilize the information from the earlier example (i.e., <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</cross-reference>) with the exception that the current market quote is 5.00-5.25. So again, assume that a book price commitment parameter is 10 (i.e., 10 option contracts at a minimum are available at the disseminated quote). Also assume that the firm participation percentage is 20%. There is a book order to sell 5 contracts at 5.10 so the current market calculated and disseminated through BestQuote is 5.00-5.10. This electronic order might be executed in the electronic trading system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Suppose a participant submits an electronic order, which was forwarded to the automatic execution system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The submitted electronic order is for 50 buy option contracts. Then, according to the exemplary embodiment, the book process subsystem <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> would execute the 5 option contracts against the book order at 5.10. In addition, the firm participation subsystem <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> would execute 1 option contract against the participant at 5.10 (20% of the remaining 5 contracts subject to the book price commitment parameter of 10 option contracts). Furthermore, the market maker subsystem <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> would execute 4 option contracts at 5.10. Consequently, the book price commitment parameter has been satisfied by trading 10 option contracts at 5.10. In the meantime, BestQuote calculates and disseminates a new offer of 5.25. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The remaining order for 40 option contracts might then be executed as follows: the firm participation subsystem <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> would execute 8 option contracts against the participant at 5.25. The market maker subsystem <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> would execute 32 contracts at 5.25. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is another example illustrating the execution process shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Similar to the illustrations in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A, 3B</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the illustration in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> pertains to yet another specific example for purposes of demonstrating the process shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. As before, it should be understood that the present embodiment is not limited to this specific example. Assume the book price commitment parameter is 10 option contracts and the firm participation percentage is 20%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> There are three sell orders in the book; each for 1 contract at 2.55, 2.60, and 2.65. The crowd&apos;s current market quote is 2.50-2.75. The market, disseminated through BestQuote, is 2.50-2.55. A participant submits an electronic order to buy 50 option contracts. The electronic order might be executed as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Assuming the electronic order was forwarded to the automatic execution system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, the order is for 50 buy option contracts. Thus, according to the exemplary embodiment, the book process subsystem <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> would execute the 1 option contract against the book order at 2.55. In addition, the firm participation subsystem <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> would execute 2 option contracts against the participant at 2.55 (20% of the remaining 9 contracts subject to the book price commitment parameter of 10 option contracts is less than 2 but is rounded up to 2). Furthermore, the market maker subsystem <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> would execute 7 option contracts at 2.55. Consequently, the book price commitment parameter has been satisfied by trading 10 option contracts at 2.55. During this time, BestQuote would preferably re-calculate the new quote, 2.50-2.60, and disseminate it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, according to the exemplary embodiment, the book process subsystem <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> would execute the 1 option contract against the book order at 2.60. In addition, the firm participation subsystem <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> would execute 2 option contracts against the participant at 2.60 (20% of the remaining 9 contracts subject to the book price commitment parameter of 10 option contracts is less than 2, but is rounded up to 2). Furthermore, the market maker subsystem <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> would execute 7 option contracts at 2.60. Consequently, the book price commitment parameter has been satisfied by trading 10 option contracts at 2.60. During this time BestQuote would preferably re-calculate the new quote, 2.50-2.65, and disseminate it. Moreover, according to the exemplary embodiment, the book process subsystem <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> would execute the 1 option contract against the book order at 2.65. In addition, the firm participation subsystem <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> would execute 2 option contracts against the participant at 2.65 (20% of the remaining 9 contracts subject to the book price commitment parameter of 10 option contracts is less than 2, but is rounded up to 2). Furthermore, the market maker subsystem <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> would execute 7 option contracts at 2.65. Consequently, the price book commitment parameter has been satisfied by trading 10 option contracts at 2.65. During this time, BestQuote would preferably re-calculate the new quote 2.50-2.75 and disseminate it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> There are no remaining book orders, and there are <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> buy option contracts left. Therefore, four contracts would be filled at 2.75 against the firm participant (20% of 20 option contracts&equals;4 option contracts). The remaining 16 contracts would be executed against the market maker subsystem 124 at 2.75. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The firm participation subsystem <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> preferably utilizes standard rounding methods when calculating the stated percentage. For example, if the percentage is set to 20%, participants would not receive any order volume on trades of two contracts or less and will preferably receive at least one contract when the number of contracts is three or more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> It would be up to the participant to assign its order flow in a given class to the broker acronym of its choice. If the member firm would prefer to assign the order flow in a given class to more than one broker, that firm might have to determine an alternative method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a screen shot of an exemplary parameter screen used in the system of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The parameter screen includes a field (shaded in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) to designate how much of a percent of an electronic order would be assigned to the participant for that class of options. The field following the &lsquo;heading&rsquo; of &ldquo;AFP: PCT&rdquo; would be defined as &lsquo;numeric only&rsquo; with a minimum value of &lsquo;000%&rsquo; (in which case the firm participation subsystem <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is not applicable) and a maximum value of &lsquo;100%&rsquo;. The &ldquo;AFP: PCT&rdquo; field might be globally updateable as one firm/one class, one firm/all classes, one firm/all classes at a station, or one firm/all classes at a post. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> During processing at the firm participation subsystem <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> the designated firm participation percentage would be utilized (if the value is greater than zero) so that a participant can participate in their own customer order flow. The remainder of the trade volume is preferably sent through the market maker subsystem <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates an exemplary LOGIN screen that enables a participant the ability to login into the automated execution system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The screen might display the participant&apos;s classes that have non-zero percentage values in the &lsquo;AFP PCT&rsquo; fields on the FIRM/CLASS Parameters screens. At the top of the new LOGIN screen a field to input a participant acronym will designate the participant to be assigned the firm participation trades for the chosen classes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> illustrates an exemplary LOGOUT screen that enables a participant, market maker or specialist the ability to logout of the automated execution system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The screen might display the firm&apos;s classes that have non-zero percentage values in the &lsquo;AFP PCT&rsquo; fields on the FIRM/CLASS Parameters screens. From this screen, either individual or all classes can be signed out of AFP trade processing for the designated firm/broker acronym. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The firm participation subsystem preferably executes the percentage of the order indicated by the &ldquo;AFP PCT&rdquo; parameter (when the value is greater than zero and based on &lsquo;standard rounding&rsquo; techniques) against the participant acronym signed in by the participant that provided the electronic order. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> However, in the exemplary embodiment, incoming electronic orders are subject to the book process subsystem <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> before they become subject to the firm participation subsystem <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, so as to not trade in front of the book. Although, when the number of contracts in the book is less than the book price commitment parameter, the remainder of the book price commitment parameter are preferably shared between firm participation subsystem <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the market maker subsystem <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The present embodiments, described herein as exemplary embodiments, provide a participant that generates customer order flow the ability to participate in the automatic execution trades without affecting the price of execution to the customer. A participant such as a broker or firm may submit buy and sell orders to an automated execution system. The automated execution system then enables the participant to desirably participate in the trades resulting from that order flow. Therefore, by allowing a participant that generates order flow to participate in the generated order flow, trading facilities can desirably attract participants to their respective automated execution system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> It should be understood that the programs, processes, methods and systems described herein are not related or limited to any particular type of trading system, unless indicated otherwise. Various types of general purpose or specialized trading systems may be used in accordance with the teachings described herein. Furthermore, the screen shots illustrating the various logon screens are exemplary only, and may also be implemented using a Microsoft Windows, Linux, or other operating system based interface, such as is known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In view of the wide variety of embodiments to which the principles of the present embodiments can be applied, it should be understood that the illustrated embodiments are exemplary only, and should not be taken as limiting the scope of the present invention. For example, more or fewer elements may be used in the figures. </paragraph>
