<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention concerns the removal of cutting fluid adhering to chips produced during the large scale machining of metal parts such as occurs in the production of engine components. Such machining uses cutting fluids which contain both oil and water which function to both cool and lubricate the cutting tool as the machining of a part proceeds. In such large scale production, the cutting fluid is collected from a number of stations and directed to filtration apparatus for removing the metal chips and other solids contaminants to allow recirculation of the cleaned cutting fluid back to the machining stations for reuse. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The metal chips are coated with the cutting fluid containing oil which tends to adhere thereto to not quickly drain away, such that the chips present a disposal problem. The metal chips can be salvaged if the quantity of fluid is reduced to a low level, i.e., 5% or less. Transport of the chip is also a problem since excessive drippage will occur unless the normally adhering fluid is removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> So called &ldquo;chip wringers&rdquo; have been developed to remove residual cutting fluid from steel, cast iron, or aluminum chips by a centrifuging apparatus. See U.S. Pat. No. 6,129,851 for an example of such apparatus. Chip wringers operate at high speed and are costly to make and expensive to maintain. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Washing processes have also been proposed to remove the oil containing fluid, see for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,147,554 and 4,565,583, but those processes, typically using magnetic fields or hot pressurized water, are in practice likewise complex and costly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is the object of the present invention to provide a simplified process and system for removing water-oil based cutting fluids from machining chips which is less costly to purchase and operate than the prior systems. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The above recited object and others which will be appreciated upon a reading of the following specification and claims are achieved by a process in which the chips collected in one or more filters are deposited in a sluice and advanced by washing solution flushing jets emanating from nozzles directed down the sluice. The chips are thereby agitated and tumbled while being advanced along the sluice to be thoroughly washed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The chips and washing solution move down the sluice and into a strainer tank where the washed chips are separated from the washing solution and thereafter drained and dried prior to being collected for disposal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The washing solution preferably comprises a citrus oil based cleanser which is a powerful detergent of a low molecular weight which is commercially available in a composition which does not foam appreciably. The solution is preferably heated to speed drying of the chips after leaving the solution. A by pass flow of the washing solution is continually circulated through an ultra filter to remove oil washed from the chips, to allow continuous processing using recirculated washing solution.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In the following detailed description, certain specific terminology will be employed for the sake of clarity and a particular embodiment described in accordance with the requirements of 35 USC 112, but it is to be understood that the same is not intended to be limiting and should not be so construed inasmuch as the invention is capable of taking many forms and variations within the scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Referring to the drawings, the system according to the present invention includes a down sloping sluice <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which can either be an above grade trough or a below grade velocity trench extending beneath the discharge end <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of each of a series of filter units <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). The sluice <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a flow of liquid established therein as described below which is designed to carry away chips deposited in the sluice <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The filter units <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be of a commercially available type, such as the filters described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,087,620; 5,624,579; and 4,396,505. The filters <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> convey machining chips filtered out of the cutting fluid to their discharge end <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the chips falling down through an opening <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) and into the sluice <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The sluice <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> could comprise a down sloping trough or below grade trench as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,980,735 to provide an extended liquid flow path to convey the chips and liquid to a chip separator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> A large volume (500 gal per minute) of washing liquid is pressurized by a pump <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and preheated by a heater <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> to a temperature above ambient but not creating a scolding hazard i.e., 105&deg;-120&deg; F. The liquid is then discharged from a series of nozzles <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> creating flushing liquid jets directing down the length of the sluice <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to convey the chips deposited therein from the filters <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the chip separator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The flushing jets emanating from the nozzles <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> creates a powerful tumbling and scouring action on the coated chips deposited therein, effectively washing the surfaces thereof to remove the cutting fluid adhering thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The chip separator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> separates the washed chips from the washing liquid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The washing liquid is preferably water containing a known powerful detergent/degreaser based on citrus oils and available commercially. This biodegradable washing liquid is available in a composition which advantageously does not have a tendency to foam, allowing the use of high pressure flushing jets without resulting in an excessive volume of suds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Additionally, this substance is of lower molecular weight than the soluble oils used in the cutting fluids, so that the oil can be filtered out while leaving the citrus oil cleanser in solution in the water by use of an ultra filter, as described below. However, other detergents/degreasers could also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> depicts one form of a chip separator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which may be employed to separate the chips from a washing liquid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> This includes an open tank <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> into which the sluice <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> empties. The tank <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has a sloping bottom <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to collect the liquid and chips at the left side as viewed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. A bottom section <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> having openings such as slots or perforations overlies a vacuum box <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in similar fashion to the filters referenced above. The inlet to the pump <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is connected to the vacuum box <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> drawing out liquid to maintain the level of liquid in the tank <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> A recirculated flight chain conveyor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is provided to carry the chips up the sloping bottom wall <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and out of the washing liquid, and over a drain chamber <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, also covered with a perforated or slotted plate <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> to allow liquid to drain off the chips and back down into the tank <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. A bank of radiant heaters <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and a blower <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> drawing air over the chips can aid the drying and draining of the liquid from the chips. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The flight conveyor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> carries the drained and dried chips further up the sloping tank bottom <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to an elevated discharge end of the tank <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, where the drained and dried chips fall through discharge opening <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and into a collection receptacle <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> A minor portion of the strained washing liquid is diverted through an ultra filter <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to continuously remove some of the accumulated oil picked up by the washing liquid during the washing process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Ultra filters are commercially available devices use to separate out heavier molecular weight substances from a liquid, by passage through very fine openings (0.0015 microns) at moderate pressures (40 psi). A purified flow of about 5 gpm would be adequate to keep the washing liquid sufficiently free of oil for use. These devices have been used to remove oil from water. See U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,929,351; 5,795,400; 4,655,927; and 3,984,324. The cleaning agent described will not be filtered out to the same extent, and thus the filtered wash liquid can be returned to the tank <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The separated oil is collected in a separate receptacle <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, for disposal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> A residual fluid on the chips of 5% or lower can thus be achieved. </paragraph>
