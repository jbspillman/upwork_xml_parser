<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Referring to the accompanying drawings, there is illustrated a refrigerator <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which has a main body <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> for storing food and the like and a door <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> on the main body. The main body is rectangular in shape having a first side <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, a second side <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, a front <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a back <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, a top <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and a bottom <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The sides are vertical and parallel and are connected by the back which extends perpendicularly to the sides from a respective end. The front is generally open in that the door is located at the front for closing the interior of the refrigerator. The door is connected to the main body at the second side when a hinged side <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of the door is located. On an opposite side of the door is a handle side <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> which is arranged to opened for access to the interior of the refrigerator. A handle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is coupled to a front side <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the door which faces outwardly. At a bottom end <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> of the door adjacent the bottom of the main body is a bracket <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. The bracket is arranged to allow a person to open the refrigerator door by using their foot such that the door can be opened when the persons hands are occupied by holding food or the like which is to be put into the refrigerator. The bracket can be used for a conventional cabinet door and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The bracket, as best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, is coupled to the bottom end of the door at a first portion <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of the bracket. The bracket is a flat rectangular plate which has a two portions which are described below. The first portion has a generally flat portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> which faces upwardly and engages the bottom end of the door and has an inner end <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> which ends flush with the inner side of the door such that when the door is closed the bracket does not interfere with the seal of the door. The first portion extends forwardly to a curved portion <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> which curves outwardly and downwardly from the front side of the door. The curved portion has a rounded end <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> which is arranged at a downward angle so that the end can be engaged by a top of a persons foot so that the door can be opened. The bracket is located at the first side of the door at a bottom corner. The bracket also has a front side <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> which is ridged so that the bracket can be engaged thereon for closing the door. The bracket can be used for a conventional cabinet door and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In operating the bracket a person, whose hands are full, used their foot to engage the rounded end of the bracket. The person then pulls rearwards on the bracket which opens the door. The bracket can then be engaged on the front side wherein the person uses their foot to push on the bracket closing the door. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the bracket is located slightly up along the front side of the door. An arm <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> extends upwardly along the front side of the door from the first portion at a right angle therefrom such that the curved portion is located at the top end of the arm, the curved portion extends forwardly and downwardly therefrom such that the rounded end of the curved portion is located adjacent to the bottom end of the door. The alternative embodiment is used in applications where the bracket is mounted on a door which is close to the ground and space is needed in order for a person to get their foot to the rounded end for opening. The bracket can be used for a conventional cabinet door and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> While one embodiment of the present invention has been described in the foregoing, it is to be understood that other embodiments are possible within the scope of the invention. The invention is to be considered limited solely by the scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
