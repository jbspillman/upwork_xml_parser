<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to optical deflection units. More particularly this invention relates to the use of optical polarization diversity to increase the capacity of a free-space steering unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Many free-space optical switching modules are based on N steering units, each of them aiming at M surfaces or apertures. The receiving aperture, i.e., an optical fiber, lens, detector, has a finite numerical aperture (NA), meaning that radiation coming from outside the NA angular cone is not transmitted through the system. This is a basic limitation of the capacity of all free-space switches. The limitation applies to switches using micro-mechanical tilting mechanisms, as well as to steering units employing phased arrays of emitters and antennas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In some conventional systems, steering is limited to one dimension. Accordingly, the rays traveling generally in the propagation direction of the optical or electromagnetic system are deflected at different angles by the steering mechanism, but lie in the same plane. As an example, one-dimensional optical arrays may be based on planar waveguides that are typically fabricated by modifying the surface of a silicon or another semiconductor slab. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Optical switching systems are limited by a fundamental &ldquo;phase-space&rdquo; limitation. The number of information channels at a given wavelength that can be handled by a given aperture is proportional to the product of the area of the aperture, multiplied by its numerical aperture. Given the numerical aperture (NA) of the receiving aperture, which can be a lens, detector, or an optical fiber, the aperture accepts light at a solid angle of acceptance, &Ugrave;, given by </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The use of two orthogonal polarizations increases the number of channels by a factor of two. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> If the incoming light having a wavelength &euml;, is described by a Gaussian mode having a waist-size w, that is identical to the radius of the receiving aperture, it will diverge at a half-angle &egrave;, given by </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The diverging light forms a solid angle given by </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>&Ugrave;</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>G</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&equals;&euml;</italic></highlight><highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/(<custom-character file="US20030002777A1-20030102-P00900.TIF" wi="20" he="20" id="custom-character-00003"/><highlight><italic>w</italic></highlight><highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>)&emsp;&emsp;(3) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The total number of channels is obtained by dividing the solid angle of acceptance by the solid angle of divergence to give </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> For example, using standard multi-mode optical fibers, and replacing the variables in Equation 4, if NA&equals;0.2, w&equals;31.2 &igrave;m, and &euml;&equals;1.3 &igrave;m, 228 channels are obtained using one polarization, and 456 are obtained if two orthogonal polarizations are employed. It should be noted that in this example part of the incoming beam is cut by the edge of the aperture, which implies a power loss of about 13 percent in this example. Furthermore, the Gaussians overlap partially in their solid angles, since they are not sharply defined. In an outgoing system, this feature would lead to cross talk. In a practical system, the total number of allowable channels is determined by allowable loss and cross talk, which are overall system considerations. One can always increase the capacity of a switch at the expense of loss and cross talk. It is to be noted that the method of increasing the switch capacity described in this example implies neither an increase in loss nor a deterioration in cross-talk. One should also note that the method disclosed in the example is useful only if there is control of the polarization state of the incoming optical channels. In particular, the method described in this example is not suitable for spatial switches in which the light is unpolarized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Polarization effects, including polarization rotation, have been used extensively in switching mechanisms. Some arrangements, in order to achieve polarization independent switching, split light into two channels having different polarizations, switch the two components independently, and eventually combine the outputs. In these arrangements, the two polarization channels carry the same information. Such arrangements are suitable for cases in which the light is unpolarized or the polarization state is unknown. From these basic considerations, one can conclude that the effect of the phase-space limitation described above can be multiplied by a factor of two when dealing with polarized light as compared to the case of unpolarized light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> There are advantages of scanning in two dimensions. However, in micro-mechanical systems that employ micro-mirrors, adding an additional axis of rotation invariably complicates the mechanism and its control, and increases production costs. In any case, the use of polarization diversity can improve the capacity of two-dimensional space switches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> There are existing switching arrangements in which the polarization properties of light are relevant. U.S. Pat. No. 5,162,944 reveals a 1&times;2 switching device where an active polarization controller is used in order to direct polarized light through different optical paths into different output ports. U.S. Pat. No. 5,381,250 describes a more complex 2&times;2 space switch based on the same principle. This system is able to handle also unpolarized light by suitably splitting polarizations into orthogonal components and actively transforming the polarization state for each component. U.S. Pat. No. 6,134,031 discloses generalization of the principle of switching using active rotation of polarization. A plurality of units is stacked, thus increasing the size of the switch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> It would be desirable to provide a free-space optical steering arrangement, which is mechanically simple, economical to produce, and which has a substantially higher channel capacity when compared with conventional arrangements. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances well-known circuits, and control logic, have not been shown in detail in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Turning now to the drawings, reference is made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, which schematically depicts an optical switching arrangement, which is constructed and operative in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention. A switching arrangement <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a first deflector module <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having N individual and independently addressed deflector elements, and a second deflector module <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> also having N deflector elements. The deflector modules <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are capable of varying the directions of the rays that are emitted by individual deflector elements, so that any ray can be directed to address a desired receiving element of an array of receivers. For example, the deflector modules <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be the selectably directable optical beam deflectors which are disclosed in copending application Ser. No. 09/470,642 of common assignee herewith, and hereby incorporated by reference. The switching arrangement <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has an output array <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> comprising 2N optical receivers or detectors. A particular feature of the switching arrangement <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is a conventional polarizing beam splitter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, which functions as a beam combiner, and is capable of unifying two beams having orthogonal polarization into a single beam without loss of power. A first polarized collection of beams <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is emitted as a plurality of rays from the deflector elements of the first deflector module <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and a second polarized collection of beams <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is emitted as a plurality of rays from the deflector elements of the second deflector module <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. In some embodiments, the polarization of the collection of beams <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is linear and identical to the polarization of the collection of beams <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. A half-wave polarizing plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is interposed between the second deflector module <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the polarizing beam splitter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. When the collections of beams <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> arrive at the polarizing beam splitter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the collection of beams <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has a polarization orthogonal to that of the collection of beams <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In other embodiments, as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, the deflector modules <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> can include intrinsic polarization optics such that their output beams have mutually orthogonal polarizations. In these embodiments, the polarizing plate can be omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The polarizing beam splitter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> combines the collections of beams <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> into a single combined beam <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The beam <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is suitably focused on the output array <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> by scanning optics <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The collections of beams <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> each carry N optical channels, all of which are in general directed in different directions and may have unique information. The combined collection of beams <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> carries 2N optical channels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In complex assemblies which are constructed in layers, the first deflector module <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the second deflector module <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and the polarizing beam splitter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> form a switching subassembly and are disposed on the same layer or plane, for example on a silicon slab. The directions of the collections of beams <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be mutually perpendicular. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> This embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is particularly useful when the size and complexity of an optical assembly are such that the production, packaging or location of two separated deflector modules having N deflectors is more convenient than a single deflector module having 2N deflectors. When compared to a design in which a deflector module consists of two stacked 1-dimensional arrays, replacement of the stack by two separate deflector modules provides reduces the profile depth of the deflector module assembly by 50 percent. As the deflector modules <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and their corresponding collections of beams <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> share the same plane, the need to construct extra layers is eliminated, thus reducing manufacturing cost. Furthermore, the maximum diagonal dimension of the deflector modules <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and the image of deflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> reflected by the mirror action of the polarizing beam splitter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, is reduced, alleviating field size requirements of the scanning optics, and reducing spot size enlargement in the plane of the output array <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Undesirable spot size enlargement results from uncorrected lens aberrations, principally affecting light originating from off-axis deflectors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> A further advantage of the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> can be appreciated in that the polarizing beam splitter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> functions as a common output polarizer. An exit polarizer is often required in conventional designs in which the deflector action is polarization dependent. The exit polarizer is necessitated when polarization is not preserved along the light path due to imperfections and misalignments of the components. The need for such an exit polarizer has been eliminated in the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> First Alternate Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Reference is now made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, which schematically illustrates a switching arrangement <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> that is constructed and operative in accordance with a first alternate embodiment of the invention. In this embodiment, stacking is allowed. The switching arrangement <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> includes a first N-element deflector module <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and a second N-element deflector module <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The deflector module <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> directs a first beam <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to a polarization beam splitter <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The deflector module <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> directs a second beam <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> through a half wave plate <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to the polarization beam splitter <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The polarization beam splitter <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> combines the beams <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> into a first output beam <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The polarization beam splitter <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, the deflector module <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and the deflector module <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are all located on an upper level <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> A third N-channel input deflector unit <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> directs a third beam <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to a mirror <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, which produces a reflected beam <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. For convenience of manufacture, the mirror <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> can be realized as a beam splitter that is identical to the polarization beam splitter <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The input deflector unit <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and the mirror <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are disposed on a lower level <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, and the polarization beam splitter <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is stacked above the mirror <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> in the Y-direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The switching arrangement <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is capable of processing 3N channels, each carrying a unique data stream. It will be observed that one member of the stack, comprising the input deflector unit <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and the mirror <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, does not employ polarization diversity. While the switching arrangement <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> has a larger vertical profile than does the switching arrangement <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), it has the advantage of being able to process a larger number of optical channels without consuming more real estate. In some embodiments it may be desirable to vertically space the mirror <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> apart from the polarization beam splitter <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> in order to allow for cooling and electrical connection access. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Second Alternate Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Reference is now made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, which schematically illustrates a switching arrangement <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> that is constructed and operative in accordance with a second alternate embodiment of the invention. The description of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is to be read in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The second alternate embodiment is similar to the first alternate embodiment, except now there are three stacked levels, comprising an upper level <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, an intermediate level <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, and a lower level <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The switching arrangement <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is capable of processing 5N channels, each carrying a unique data stream. The second alternate embodiment may be operative without the lower level <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The upper level <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> includes two N-channel deflector unit <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> arranged to direct beams to a beam splitter <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, which have a coplanar arrangement identical to that of the deflector modules <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, and the polarization beam splitter <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). An identical grouping of two N-channel deflector units <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, and a beam splitter <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is disposed in the lower level <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. Half-wave plates <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> are provided to receive the beams that are output by the deflector units <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. The intermediate level <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> carries an input deflector unit <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and a mirror <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, which are arranged in the same manner as the input deflector unit <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and the mirror <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). For convenience of manufacture, the mirror <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> can be realized as a beam splitter, such that the mirror <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, the beam splitter <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and the mirror <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> are identical. It will be observed that the polarization diversity is employed in the upper level <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and the lower level <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, but is not employed in the intermediate level <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
