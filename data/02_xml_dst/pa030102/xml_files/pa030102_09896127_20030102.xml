<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A variety of the components used in optical networking include one or more surfaces that reflect or transmit light. The smoothness of these surfaces can affect the performance of the optical component and/or the optical network. For instance, many optical components include a facet through which light signals enter or exit the optical component. The amount of reflection and scattering that occurs at the facet increases as the roughness of the facet increases. As a result, increasing the roughness of the surface increases the amount of optical loss associated with the optical component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> For the above reasons, there is a need for a method of smoothing surfaces on optical components. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a method of smoothing one or more surfaces on an optical component. The method includes providing an optical component having one or more surfaces that have an undesirable level of roughness. The surfaces can be surfaces where light signals are reflected or transmitted. The method also includes performing a smoothing etch so as to smooth the one or more surfaces. In some instances, the component is cleaned before the smoothing etch is performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> A suitable smoothing etch includes concurrently applying a first medium and a second medium to the one or more surfaces. The first medium is selected to convert the material that defines the one or more surfaces to a second material. For instance, the first medium can be an oxidant selected to convert the material that defines the one or more surfaces to an oxide of the material that defines the one or more surfaces. In some instances, the first medium isotropically converts the material. The second medium is selected to remove the second material from the one or more surfaces. For instance, the second medium can be selected to remove the oxide from the one or more surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The roughness of the one or more surfaces results from the presence of bumps on the one or more surfaces. The first medium can be selected to convert the material at the tops of bumps to the second material faster than it converts the material in the valleys between the bumps to the second material. As a result, the second medium removes material from the tops and sides of the bumps faster than the second medium removes materials from between the bumps. Removing material from the tops of the bumps faster than from between the bumps causes the bumps to be smoothed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The first medium and the second medium can be applied to the one or more surfaces in a wet etch. A suitable wet etch solution employs HNO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>as the first medium and HF as the second medium. When silicon defines the one or more surfaces, this wet etch solution can be used at room temperature and pressure to provide the one or more surfaces with a roughness less than 1 nm depending on the duration, original roughness of the one or more surfaces and conditions of the smoothing etch. The ability to perform the smoothing etch at room temperature and pressure reduces the costs and complexity associated with fabrication of the optical components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> illustrates an edge of a component <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having a waveguide <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> ending in a light transmitting surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> known as a facet <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The component <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a light transmitting medium <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> positioned adjacent to a light barrier <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The light barrier <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is positioned adjacent to a substrate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The light transmitting medium <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is formed into a ridge <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> extending from a side <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the component <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The ridge <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> defines a portion of a light signal carrying region <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The light barrier <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes a material that encourages light traveling through the light signal carrying region <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to be reflected back into the light signal carrying region <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the light barrier <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> defines another portion of the light signal carrying region <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. A profile of a light signal traveling along the light signal carrying region <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is illustrated by the arrow labeled A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Suitable substrates <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> include, but are not limited to, silicon. Suitable light transmitting media include, but are not limited to, silicon and polysilicon. The light barrier <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can include a material having reflective properties such as metals. Alternatively, the light barrier <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can have a different index of refraction than the light transmitting medium <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. For instance, the light barrier <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be silica or air when the light transmitting medium <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is silicon. The change in the index of refraction causes reflection of a portion of the light signals incident on the light barrier <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The component <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a facet <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> through which light signals enter and/or exit the component <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The facet <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is often connected to an optical fiber in communication with an optical network. Light signals from the network can enter the optical component <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through the facet <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and/or light signals from the component <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can exit the component <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through the facet <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The rougher the surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the larger the amount of reflection and scattering that will occur at the facet <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, a rough facet <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be associated with increased optical loss. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The ridge <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> includes a top side <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> between two lateral sides <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The light signals are reflected off these sides <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> as the light signal travels along the light signal carrying region <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The amount of reflection and scattering that occurs as the light signal travels along the waveguide <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> increases as the roughness of these sides <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> increases. Accordingly, rough sides can increase the optical losses associated with the waveguide <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference> illustrates a portion of an optical component <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having another embodiment of a reflecting surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The reflecting surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is positioned at the intersection of two waveguides <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be positioned at an angle that reflects light from one of the waveguides <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> into the other waveguide <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. For instance, the surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be positioned so as to provide total internal reflection. Total internal reflection is encouraged by increasing the angle between the intersecting waveguides <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can extend through the light transmitting medium <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to the light barrier <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A, the light signals travel through the light transmitting medium <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in the ridge <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and below the ridge <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, extending the surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> through the light transmitting medium <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> increases the percentage of the light signal that is reflected by the surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. As noted above, roughness increases the amount of scattering and reflection at the surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, smoothing this surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can increase the performance of the component <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The components <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and waveguides <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference> are only an example of the types and forms of components <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> that can be employed in conjunction with the present invention. For instance, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/686,733; entitled &ldquo;Waveguide Having a Light Drain&rdquo;; filed on Oct. 10, 2000 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 60/239,534; entitled &ldquo;A Compact Integrated Optics Based Arrayed Waveguide Demultiplexer&rdquo;; filed on Oct. 10, 2000 teach a variety of different component <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> constructions and are each incorporated herein in their entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A through <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</cross-reference> illustrate one method that can be used to form optical components <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A and/or <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> illustrates an example of a silicon on insulator wafer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The silicon on insulator wafer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> includes a first silicon layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, a silica layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and a second silicon layer <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. A mask <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is formed over the regions of the second silicon layer <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> where the ridges <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are to be formed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>. A surface formation etch is performed so as to etch the exposed regions of the second silicon layer <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The surface formation etch results in formation of the lateral sides <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the ridge <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</cross-reference>. Accordingly, the surface formation etch is performed until the lateral sides <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> the ridge <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> have the desired height as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</cross-reference>. The ridge <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> typically extends about 1-9 &mgr;m above the side <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the component <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In the case of constant 1&times;mask printing, the sides of the mask <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are typically formed, with about 50-100 nm of roughness due to the limitation of mask <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> formation technologies. This roughness of the mask <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> results in a roughness of about 50-100 nm extending along the length of the ridge <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. The smoothness moving along a line extending vertically along the height of the ridge <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> results from the choice of surface formation etch used to form the ridge <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Because the roughness along the length of the ridge <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is caused by a different mechanism than the roughness along the height of the ridge <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, a different level of roughness can occur in different directions. A smoothing etch according to the present invention can provide smoothing in each of these directions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> After formation of a ridge <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> having the desired height, the mask <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is removed to provide the component <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Reflecting surfaces <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> such as the reflecting surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference> are typically formed by employing various combinations of masking <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and surface formation etches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The surface formation etch is typically a wet etch or a dry etch that etches the second silicon layer <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> at about 0.5-20 &mgr;m/min. Additionally, the surface formation etch is typically an isotropic etch. The surface formation etch is often performed with the Bosch process where application of an etch is alternated with application of a passivant. The Bosch process typically provides a surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with a roughness of greater than 220 nm. In some instances, the Bosch process provides a roughness of greater than 270 nm. In other instances, the Bosch process provides a roughness of greater than 330 nm. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/690,959, filed on Oct. 16, 2000 and entitled &ldquo;Formation of a Smooth Vertical Surface on an Optical Component&rdquo; teaches a method of forming a surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having a roughness greater than 20 nm and is incorporated herein in its entirety. Another suitable surface formation etch is taught in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/845,093, filed on Apr. 27, 2001, entitled &ldquo;Formation of an Optical Component having Smooth Sidewalls&rdquo; and incorporated herein in its entirety. Accordingly, surface formation etches can be performed so as to achieve surfaces <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having a roughness greater than 50 nm, 100 nm, 150 nm, 170 nm or 190 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Facets <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> positioned at the edge of the component <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be formed by mechanical methods such as milling or laser cutting. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/690,959, filed on Oct. 16, 2000 and entitled &ldquo;Formation of a Smooth Vertical Surface on an Optical Component&rdquo; teaches a method of forming a facet <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> having a roughness greater than 20 nm. In some instances, this method provides a facet <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> roughness greater than 100 nm, 150 nm, 170 nm or 190 nm. Further, the facets <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are often polished so as to have a roughness greater than 100 nm. Polishing techniques are difficult to apply to surfaces <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that are not positioned at an edge of a component <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, polishing techniques are difficult to apply to the top and/or lateral sides <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the ridge <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and are largely limited to polishing of facets <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to the edge of the component <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The present method can be employed to smooth reflecting and/or transmitting surfaces <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The method includes obtaining an optical component <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having one or more surfaces <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to be smoothed. Obtaining the component <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can include fabricating the component <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or receiving the component <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from a supplier. The method also includes performing a smoothing etch so as to reduce the roughness of one or more surfaces <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on the component <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> A suitable smoothing etch includes applying a first medium and a second medium to the one or more surfaces <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The first medium can be selected to convert the material that defines the one or more surfaces <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to a second material. As shown above, the light transmitting medium <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can be the material that defines the one or more surfaces <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Conversion of the material to the second material can include changing the material, injecting a substance into the material and/or changing the structure of the material. An example of changing the structure of the material includes changing a crystalline structure of the material into another material. The second medium is selected to remove the second material from the one or more surfaces <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> A suitable first medium can be an oxidant selected to convert the material that defines the one or more surfaces <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to an oxide of the material that defines the one or more surfaces <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In some instances, the first medium is selected to isotroptically convert the material that defines the one or more surfaces <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to an oxide of the material that defines the one or more surfaces <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Suitable first media include, but are not limited to, HNO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, and HF. The oxide of the material that defines the one or more surfaces <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> serves as the second material. A suitable second medium can be selected to remove the oxide from the one or more surfaces <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Suitable oxide removers include, but are not limited to, HF and BOE (buffered oxide etch, HF with ammonium fluoride NH4F 1:6 or 1:10 standard pre-mix solution). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The smoothing etch can be a wet etch employing a solution that contains the first medium and the second medium. When the first medium is an oxidant and the second medium is an oxide remover, suitable molar ratios for the oxide remover to the oxidant include, but are not limited to, a range from 1:4 to 1:20, a range from 1:2 to 1:10, a range from 1:4 to 1:8 and a range from 1:5 to 1:7. Increasing the amount of oxidant increases the etch rate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Suitable solvents or buffering agents include, but are not limited to, acetic acid (CH3COOH), and H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O. The presence of water in the solution can reduce the oxidation power of the oxidant. Accordingly, the solvent can exclude water in some instances. For example, the solvent can be galacial acetic acid. Suitable molar ratios of oxidant to solvent include, but are not limited to, a range from 1:5 to 1:100, 1:20 to 1:80 and 1:30 to 1:50. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> When the light transmitting medium <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is silicon and the first medium is HNO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, the HNO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>reacts with the silicon to form SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. When the second medium is HF, the HF reacts with the SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>to form H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>SiF<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>, which enters the solution and is accordingly removed from the component <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. When the solvent is acetic acid, the smoothing etch can be performed at room temperature and room pressure. As a result, there is no need for elevated temperatures and/or pressures. In some instances, the solution components are selected to provide an etching rate of about 20 nm/min. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The smoothing etch is performed until the desired level of smoothness is achieved. When the light transmitting medium <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is silicon, the first medium is HN<highlight><bold>03</bold></highlight>, the second medium is HF and the solvent is acetic acid, the smoothing etch can generally provide smoothing of the optical component <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to a smoothness of less than 5 nm in a period of 1 to 10 minutes depending on the initial roughness of the surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to be smoothed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> After the smoothing etch, the component <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be cleaned with deionized water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In some instances, the effect of the smoothing etch on the dimensions of the light transmitting medium <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> should be taken into consideration. For instance, when the smoothing etch is performed such that 0.02 &mgr;m of light transmitting medium <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are removed and a ridge with a width of 7 &mgr;m is desired, the component <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> should be fabricated such that the ridge has a width of 7.04 &mgr;m before the smoothing etch is performed. The excess width of the ridge compensates for the effects of the smoothing etch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> When smoothing of one or more surfaces <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on the optical component <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is not desired, these surfaces <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be masked during the smoothing etch. When more than one surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is to be smoothed, the level of smoothing desired on each of the surfaces <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be different. The smoothing etch is performed until each surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has the desired level of smoothness. Alternatively, one surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be masked and a smoothing etch can be performed on the exposed surface(s) <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> until the level of smoothness desired for those surfaces <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is achieved. The mask can be removed and another mask <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> formed so as to leave exposed regions of the component <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> where additional smoothing is desired. A second smoothing etch can then be performed to achieve the desired level of smoothness desired for the exposed surfaces <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. This technique can provide surfaces <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having different degrees of smoothness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The smoothing etch described above can result in surfaces <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having a roughness of less than 1 nm depending on the duration and conditions of the smoothing etch as well as the material being etched. In some instances, the smoothing etch provide a surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having a roughness less than 330 nm, less than 270 nm, less than 220 nm, less than 190 nm, less than 170 nm, less than 150 nm, 100 nm, less than 60 nm, less than 40 nm, less than 20 nm, less than 15 nm, less than 10 nm, less than 8 nm, less than 4 nm or less than 1 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The method of the present invention can also include performing one or more foreign substance removal operations before performing the smoothing etch. The foreign substance removal operations remove foreign substances from the surface(s) to be smoothed by the smoothing etch. Foreign substances include substances other than the material that defines the surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Many of these foreign substances can act like a mask during the smoothing etch. Because the portion of the light transmitting medium <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> under a foreign substance that acts as a mask are not smoothed, these foreign substances can cause the surface(s) to have an increased roughness. Removing these foreign substances before performing the smoothing etch prevents the foreign substances from increasing the surface roughness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Examples of foreign substances include, but are not limited to, mask left on the surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> from incomplete mask removal, polymer formed on the surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> during the surface formation etch and air born contaminants such as are often found in clean rooms. Another example of a foreign substance includes a portion of the surface that has converted from the material that defines the surface to another material. For instance, the one or more surfaces <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be defined by silicon. Exposure of the component <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to air can cause the silicon to convert to silica. When this silica is not desired on the surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the silica can serve as a foreign substance that acts as a mask during the smoothing etch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> A suitable foreign substance removal operation includes an oxygen plasma cleaning. When a mask is constructed of photoresist, organic polymer or wax, the oxygen plasma cleaning can remove any mask left on the optical component <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. A suitable oxygen plasma cleaning step is performed with a 100% O2 plasma at 200 W of plasma power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Another suitable foreign substance removal operation includes a polymer residue cleaning. A polymer residue cleaning can remove polymers formed during a surface formation etch. A suitable polymer residue cleaning operation includes a wet etch performed in a solution of H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. When the solution has a H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>:H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>molar ratio of about 17:1, the wet etch can be performed for about 15 minutes at about 90&deg; C. The wet etch can be followed by a deionized water rinse. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Another suitable foreign substance removal operation includes a silica removal operation for removing silica formed on a silicon. An example of a silica removal operation includes a wet etch in a 2% solution of HF or a standard BOE solution. Certain embodiments of the smoothing etch will remove silica. As a result, whether a silica removal operation is desired can depend on the conditions of the smoothing etch. Additionally, the silica removal operation is not needed when the component is fabricated such that silica does not form on the surfaces <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to be smoothed. The silica removal operation can also be optional when the material that defines the one or more surfaces <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is not subject to a tendency to convert to silica. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Although the component <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and methods disclosed above are disclosed in conjunction with a ridge waveguide, the invention can be used with other types of optical components and other waveguide types. For instance, the invention can be used with components having channel waveguides. Additionally, the invention can be used to smooth surfaces <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> other than facets and sides of waveguides. For instance, the invention can be used to smooth the surfaces <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of star couplers and Rowland circles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The components disclosed above are typically used in the 1550 nm wavelength range although the method disclosed above can be employed with optical components using much different wavelength ranges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Other embodiments, combinations and modifications of this invention will occur readily to those of ordinary skill in the art in view of these teachings. Therefore, this invention is to be limited only by the following claims, which include all such embodiments and modifications when viewed in conjunction with the above specification and accompanying drawings.</paragraph>
