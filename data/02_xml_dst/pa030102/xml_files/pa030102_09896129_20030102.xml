<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> computer network system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a signing party <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that can communicate with a relying party <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> over a computer network <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The network can include, for example, a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the World Wide Web (Web) or other computer network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The relying party <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be a computer network provider of goods or services such as a business-to-consumer Web based provider of goods or services. For example, the relying party <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be a Web based retailer of consumer products such as books, software toys, games and the like. Alternatively, the relying party <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be a business-to-business Web site such as an online marketplace for medical supplies or other types of supplies. Other examples include online banking institutions, brokerage firms, and health care services. Although a single relying party <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is shown in system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the system can include more than one relying party communicating over the network <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The signing party <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be an individual consumer or a business entity interested in entering into a business transaction with the relying party <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. For example, the signing party <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may desire to purchase goods from a Web based retailer. The signing party <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can communicate with the relying party <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by using a personal computer (PC) capable of connecting to the network, or other network capable computer device. Although a single signing party <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is shown in system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the system can include more than one signing party communicating over the network <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A certificate authority <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be a networked based authority that can issue and manage digital credentials, such as digital certificates, for the signing party. For example, the signing party <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may request a digital certificate from the certificate authority <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> when the signing party <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> contemplates entering into a business transaction with the relying party <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Similarly, the relying party <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can contact the certificate authority <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and request the digital certificate of signing party <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> during the course of business. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> As part of the public key infrastructure (PKI), the certificate authority <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can check with a registration authority <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> to verify whether the information in the request for a digital certificate provided by the signing party <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is valid. Depending on the particular PKI implementation, the digital certificate can include the signing party&apos;s public verification key, the expiration date of the certificate, the signing party&apos;s name, and other information about the signing party. A private key of the certificate authority <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> should sign the digital certificate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> An assurance provider <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be a network service provider that can provide assurance to the relying party <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> that the digital credentials accompanying a business transaction provided by the signing party <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are valid. Digital credentials can include a signed document, a digital signature associated with the document and a certificate of the signing party. When the signing party <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> contemplates entering into a business transaction with the relying party <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, it can request the services of the assurance provider <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> over the network using a secure protocol such as a secure socket layer (SSL). SSL is a security protocol for managing the transmission of messages over a computer network such as the Internet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the signing party <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> sends <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> a signature request to the assurance provider <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> indicating that the signing party <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> desires to enter into a business transaction with the relying party <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. An example of a business transaction includes the signing party <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> purchasing goods or services from the relying party <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The transaction may require the signing party <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to digitally sign a document such as a purchase order. The signing party <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the assurance provider <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can communicate over the network <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> using SSL. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> After the assurance provider <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> receives the signature request from the signing party <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the assurance provider responds by sending <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> one or more identifiers to the signing party <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The identifier can be a unique number based on a random number called a &ldquo;nonce.&rdquo; The identifier also can include a time-stamp reflecting the time the signature request was received by the assurance provider <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. As discussed in detail below, the time stamp can be used by the relying party <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to check when the digital credential of the signing party <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> was validated by the assurance provider <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The assurance provider <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can have mechanisms to detect potentially fraudulent transactions. For example, the assurance provider may keep a record of typical activity of the signing party <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and could then detect if some particular transaction, or some group of transactions, is atypical. Also, the signing party <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> could indicate to the assurance provider the types of transactions that should be expected, and perhaps the time and value of expected transactions. Then a transaction that did not meet these expectations could be flagged as potentially fraudulent. If the assurance provider <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> identified a transaction as potentially fraudulent, then the assurance provider could follow some predetermined course of action, which could include rejecting the transaction and notifying the signing party of the potentially fraudulent transaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Upon receipt of the identifier(s) from the assurance provider <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the signing party <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> checks <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> whether the time indicated by the time stamp matches the time the signature request was generated based on the identifier(s). If the check reveals a discrepancy between the time in the time stamp and the time the signature request was generated, then the signing party <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can send <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> an error notification to the assurance provider <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. It also can take remedial action such as terminate the transaction. If the check reveals that the times match, then the signing party <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can proceed with the transaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The signing party <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> creates <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> a first digital credential <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) that can include a first document to be signed <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and a first digital signature <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The first document to be signed <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> can include a message <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> to be signed by the signing party. The signing party <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can append to the document to be signed <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> the name(s)of one or more relying party(s) <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> that are to receive the first digital credential <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in connection with the business transaction. In addition, the nonce <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and the time stamp <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and any other fields in identifier previously sent by the assurance provider <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can be included in the first document to be signed <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> After the first document to be signed <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> has been created, the signing party <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> produces a first digital signature <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. To sign the message or other document digitally, the signing party can perform a computation that takes the document to be signed <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and a private signature key associated with the signing party <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as input and produces the first digital signature <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. To simplify the discussion, it is assumed that the signing party <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has previously obtained a private signature key and a public verification key pair, and has obtained a certificate for this public key from the certificate authority <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> After the signing party <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> generates the first digital credential <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the signing party <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> sends <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> the credential <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to the assurance provider <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The assurance provider <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> checks <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> whether the first digital signature <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is correct, for example, by performing a computation that takes the message <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, the first digital signature <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and the public verification key of the signing party <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as input and produces an output that indicates whether the signature is verified. If the result of the computation indicates that the signature failed to verify, then the assurance provider <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> rejects <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> the business transaction associated with the first digital credential <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> If the result of the computation (at block <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>) indicates that the signature is verified, the assurance provider <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> proceeds to check <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> the status of the signing party <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, including checking whether the private signature key associated with the signing party <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is still valid. That can be accomplished by verifying whether the digital certificate, associated with the signing party <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, has been revoked by the certificate authority <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> that originally issued the digital certificate. The assurance provider <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> checks whether the value of the nonce <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and the time-stamp <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> previously sent to the signing party <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (in block <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>) match the nonce and time-stamp in the first document to be signed <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> sent by the signing party at block <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. The business transaction associated with the first digital credential <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be rejected <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> if the signing party status check indicates a failure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> If the result of the signing party status check (at block <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>) is successful, the assurance provider <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> proceeds to check <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> the status of the relying party <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The relying party <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be identified by the relying party <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> specified in the first signed document <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Checking the status can include verifying that the relying party <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has a contract with the assurance provider <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The assurance provider <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> also can check whether the business transaction associated with the first digital credential <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> falls within limits or complies with policies previously established by the relying party <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. If the check fails, then the business transaction can be rejected <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. On some transactions there may be no requirement to check the status of the relying party <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> If the result of checking (at block <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>) is successful, the assurance provider <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> proceeds to store <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> information related to the business transaction. This information can include the digital credential <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and result of the transaction. The assurance provider <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> also can allow the signing party to view some or all of the business transactions and the signed documents generated by the signing party. For example, the assurance provider <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can create a database of business transactions which the signing party can view using a computer connected to the assurance provider through the network <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The assurance provider <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> creates <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> a second digital credential <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) which can include a second document to be signed <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and a second digital signature <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The second document to be signed <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> can incorporate the contents of the first document to be signed <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> such as the message <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, the name of the relying party <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the nonce <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and the time stamp <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The first document to be signed <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> also can include the first digital signature <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the signing party. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The assurance provider <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> attaches a validity statement <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to the second document to be signed <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. The statement <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> can indicate whether the digital certificate of the signing party is valid and whether the business transaction contemplated by the signing party <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is within pre-established limits set by the relying party <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The assurance provider <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> produces a second digital signature <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> using the second document to be signed <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, the validity statement <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, and the private signature key of the assurance provider <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> as input. After the assurance provider <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> forms the second digital credential <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, it sends <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> the credential to the signing party <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Upon receipt of the second digital credential <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the signing party <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> forwards <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> the digital credential to the relying party <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> associated with the business transaction contemplated by the signing party <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The digital credential includes the second signed document, and could include the first signed document and the certificate of the signing party <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The relying party <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> checks <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> whether the second digital signature <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is correct by performing a computation that takes the second document to be signed <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, the second digital signature <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, and the public verification key of the assurance provider <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> as input, and produces as output an indication of whether the signature is verified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The relying party <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> could also check the time stamp of the assurance provider, as the relying party might not want to accept a transaction that was old. The relying party could also check the validity statement <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the assurance provider to see if it met the requirements necessary for the transaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Although the relying party <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> could check the validity of the first digital signature <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in the first digital credential <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, that may be unnecessary because the second digital signature <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> generated by the assurance provider <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can provide assurance that the first digital signature is valid. For example, the assurance provider <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can provide assurance that the private signature key of the signing party <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> was valid at the time the first digital signature was created based on the time stamp <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. If the result of computation indicates that the signature failed to verify, the business transaction is rejected <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, if the result of the computation indicates that the signature is verified, the relying party <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can accept the business transaction and proceed with other aspects of the transaction such as processing information in the message <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Even after the transaction has been validated by the assurance provider <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the assurance provider may subsequently be notified by the certificate authority <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> that the digital certificate of the signing party <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has been revoked. The assurance provider <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> then can notify the relying party <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> that the previously approved transaction should be revoked. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates a programmable computing system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> that can provide an operating environment suitable for use by the signing party <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the relying party <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the certificate authority <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the assurance provider <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, or the registration authority <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> includes a processor <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> such as the Intel PENTIUM&reg; processor. In various configurations, the system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can represent any server, personal computer, laptop or a hand held device, a personal digital assistant (PDA) or a network enabled cellular phone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> has system memory <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>, including read only memory (ROM) <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> and random access memory (RAM) <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> which can be connected to the processor <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> by a system data/address bus <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. The input/output (I/O) bus <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> is connected to the data/address bus <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> by a bus controller <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the I/O bus <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> is implemented as a standard Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) bus. The bus controller <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight> examines signals from the processor <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> to route the signals to the appropriate bus. Signals between the processor <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> and the system memory <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> are passed though the bus controller <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight>. However, signals from the processor <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> intended for devices other than system memory <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> are routed onto the I/O bus <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Various devices are connected to the I/O bus <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> including a hard disk drive <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, a floppy drive <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> that is used to read a floppy disk <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight>, and an optical drive <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> such as a CD-ROM drive that is used to read an optical disk <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>. A video or other display <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> is connected to the I/O bus <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> by a video adapter <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The signing party <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can enter commands and information into the system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> by using a keyboard <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> and/or pointing device, such as a mouse <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>, connected to bus <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> through I/O ports <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>. The system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> also includes a modem <highlight><bold>229</bold></highlight> and a network adapter <highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight> that can be used to communicate over the network <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> using wired or wireless connection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Software applications <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> and data are typically stored by one of the memory storage devices, which may include the hard disk <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, the floppy disk <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight>, and the CD-ROM <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> and are copied to RAM <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> for execution. The operating system <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight> executes software applications <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> and carries out instructions issued by the signing party. The Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> for the system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> includes a set of basic executable routines that help transfer information between the computing resources within the system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Operating system <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight> and other software applications <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> use these low-level service routines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The foregoing techniques can provide the relying party <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> assurance that a digital signature is valid at the time it was generated by the signing party <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The relying party <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can rely on the validity of the digital signature of the signing party without contacting the certificate authority <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to check the status of the certificate of the signing party. It may no longer be necessary for the relying party <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to contact the certificate authority or the assurance provider to verify the digital signature of the signing party. As a result, the demand or load previously placed on the relying party <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be reduced. Instead, the signing party is responsible for establishing a connection with the assurance provider to provide assurance that the signing party&apos;s digital signature is valid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The foregoing techniques also provide security advantages. For example, if an unauthorized agent obtains temporary access to the private signature key of the signing party, the unauthorized agent will need to obtain all the digital second signatures from the assurance provider while the unauthorized agent has such access. In some cases, the assurance provider can detect the occurrence of several signatures during a certain time frame and take corrective action. The assurance provider can maintain a log of the business transactions, including fraudulent transactions, which can be viewed by the signing party at a later time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the foregoing techniques can provide a mechanism to reduce the incidence of spoofing on the Web. For example, the relying party may be a web site that is presenting a form to the signing party to sign. In some instances, it may be possible for an unscrupulous relying party to present on the signing party&apos;s screen something different than what is actually being signed by the signing party&apos;s key. Instead, the techniques presented here allow the signing party to connect to the Web site provided by the assurance provider during the signature operation. The Web site of the assurance provider could display a verification screen with the information which is being given to the signing party again and, thus, minimize spoofing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Various modifications may be made. For example, the time stamp can be attached to the first digital document after the first digital signature has been validated by the assurance provider. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Various features of the system can be implemented in hardware, software, or a combination of hardware and software. For example, some aspects of the system can be implemented in computer programs executing on programmable computers. Each program can be implemented in a high level procedural or object oriented programming language to communicate with a computer system. Furthermore, each such computer program can be stored on a storage medium, such as read-only-memory (ROM) readable by a general or special purpose programmable computer or processor, for configuring and operating the computer when the storage medium is read by the computer to perform the functions described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Other implementations are within the scope of the following claims. </paragraph>
