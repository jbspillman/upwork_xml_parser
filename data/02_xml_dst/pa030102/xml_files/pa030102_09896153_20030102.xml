<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a communication technique used in a wireless communication system and, more particularly, to a receiver for processing a received signal from a base station. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A communication system is formed, at a minimum, of a base station and a mobile station, which are interconnected by way of a communication channel. Information to be communicated by the base station (also referred to as cell site) to the mobile station is transmitted via the communication channel to the mobile station. A wide variety of different types of communication systems have been developed and are regularly utilized to effectuate communication of information between base stations and mobile stations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A wireless communication system, is an example of a communication system, which has been made possible due to advancements in communication technologies. Various standards have been promulgated relating to various types of wireless communication systems, and various types of wireless, as well as other, communication systems have been constructed, corresponding to such standards. The IS-95 and IS-2000 interim standards, promulgated by the EIA/TIA, are exemplary of standards which pertain to a wireless communication system, utilizing code division multiple access (CDMA) communication techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Enhanced 3<highlight><superscript>rd </superscript></highlight>Generation CDMA systems are currently being developed to address high speed Internet packet data services. Examples of such systems, which are the result of an evolution of IS-95 and IS2000, are 1XEV-DO (TIA/EIA/IS-856) and 1XEV-DV standards. These systems utilize both CDMA and some type of time division multiplexing communication techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In an effort to port the Internet to the wireless communication system, 1 XEV-DO and 1 XEV-DV systems use a fat data pipe concept, which is shared among a number of users (mobile stations). The fat pipe, called the shared supplemental channel, is de-multiplexed into several code channels according to the usual CDMA access techniques. In the current proposal for 1XEV-DV, for example, the pipe is actually transmitted on 14 or 15 Walsh codes of length 16. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In high data rate systems, it is assumed that low mobility prevails and the use of soft handoff is not needed. Also, use of soft handoff would reduce the data rate capacity of the system. Therefore, a fast cell site selection is performed in the network, aided by measurements made at the mobile station. However, the mobile station can only assist the BS by sending information on the reverse link. Because of impairments on the reverse link, the BS may actually select a less then preferred cell site. instead of the preferred target cell site </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In the high data rate, the shared supplemental channel is shared among a number of mobile stations in accordance with CDMA and TDMA communication techniques. The base station has an admission control algorithm such that the base station decides 1) when to transmit data packets to a particular mobile station; 2) the modulation type and coding rate; 3) the Walsh codes (among the 14 or 15 available) that will be assigned; and 4) the cell site that will transmit the data packets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The BS simultaneously transmits the data packet, intended for the mobile station, on the supplemental channel and a signaling frame on the dedicated channel. This signaling frame provides the mobile station information such as 1) whether a data packet was sent to that MS; 2) the modulation type and coding rate used; 3) the Walsh codes; and 4) which cell site is transmitting on shared supplemental channel. Upon reception of a signaling frame, the mobile station decodes the dedicated channel and determines if there was a data packet for it on the shared supplemental channel. Thus, the mobile station is expected to buffer the received shared supplemental channel information in order to be able, after the fact, demodulate and decode the share supplemental channel. Generally, the dedicated channel and all the supplemental channels are de-spread to retrieve necessary information and all the expanded information is stored is a buffer. Generally, the buffer size required depends on the number of fingers needed, the number of Walsh channels, the sampling rate, etc. Since the mobile station must de-spread all the Walsh channels to determine if a data packet is transmitted for that MS, a large buffer size is needed, even if only one Walsh channel may apply. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Therefore, it would be useful if method and apparatus was provided to manage the buffering and processing of signals that would require less storage space and processing time. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The present invention, accordingly, advantageously, provides apparatus, and an associated method by which received communication signals are first stored in RAM and then processed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The present invention encompasses a receiver having a buffer storing a received signal and replaying the received signal to process only a necessary portion of the signal. The buffer may comprise a plurality of buffers, wherein a received signal for a current frame is stored in a first buffer and a second buffer is used to process the signal received in a previous frame. According to an aspect of the invention, the received signal is stored in buffer prior to de-spreading the signal, thereby, advantageously requiring less storage space for the buffer. Once the signal is stored for a frame, during the next frame the signal may be evaluated to determine is any data for the mobile station has been transmitted on a shared supplemental channel. The signal is further processed only if data packets for that mobile station have been transmitted on the shared supplemental channel. Otherwise, advantageously, no further processing is performed on the signal to find data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> A more complete appreciation of the invention and to the scope thereof can be obtained from the accompanying drawings, the detailed description of the presently preferred embodiments of the invention, and the appended claims.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates an exemplary wireless communication system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The communication system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> provides for radio communication between two communication stations, such as a base station <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and a mobile station <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, by way of radio links formed therebetween. The mobile station <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is configured to receive and transmit signals to communicate with plurality of base stations, including base station <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. In the exemplary embodiment shown in the figure, the communication system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> operates according to the specification proposed for 1XEV-DO (approved version IS-856/TSG-C C.S0024 ver 2.0, published 10/2000) and 1XEV-DV (current proposal &num; C05-20010611-007 MNTIPA<highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight>1 XEV-DV L1 Framework) communication system, which utilizes CDMA communication techniques. It should be understood that operation of the embodiment of the present invention is similarly also possible in other types of radio, and other, communication systems. Therefore, while the following description shall describe operation of an embodiment of the present invention with respect to the 1XEV-DO or 1XEV-DV systems, operation of an embodiment of the present invention can analogously be described with respect to any of various other types of communication systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The base station <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, is coupled to a base station controller (BSC) <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. And, the base station <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is, in turn, coupled to a mobile switching center (MSC) <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. The MSC is coupled to a network backbone, here a PSTN (public switched telephonic network) <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>, and correspondent node (CN) <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> is coupled to the PSTN <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. A communication path is formable between the correspondent node <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> and the mobile station <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> by way of the PSTN <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>, the MSC <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, the BSC <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and base station <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and a radio link formed between the base station and the mobile station. Thereby, the communications, of both voice data and non-voice data, are effectual between the CN <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> and the mobile station <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. In the exemplary implementation as shown in the figures, the base station defines a cell, and numerous cell sites are positioned at spaced-apart location throughout a geographical area to define a plurality of cells within any of which the mobile station <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is capable of radio communication with an associated base station to communication therewith. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In the operation of the communication systems <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> according to 1XEV-DO and 1XEV-DV systems, the base station <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> transmits spread spectrum signals to mobile station <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> on what is generally known as the forward link. In general, the forward link transmission comprises a plurality of frames defined by the proposed system specification. In the exemplary communication system, the signals are received substantially during the reception a frame on plurality of channels (forward link channels), generally comprising signals for a pilot channel, control channels, supplemental channels and dedicated channels. The supplemental channels comprise interleaved and spread data signals. The dedicated channel comprise signaling information about the data transmitted on the supplemental channels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The base station <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> broadcasts on the forward link channels, for example, on a pilot channel, a paging channel, a control channel, a dedicated channel and a plurality of supplemental channels. Generally, all the supplemental channels are spread using a Walsh Code in a process known as Walsh covering. Additionally, all the channels are modulated using a modulation-coding scheme (MCS) having a modulation type and coding rate. The modulation schemes are defined by the type of system, such as 1-XEVDO or 1XEV-DV, wherein each mobile station, in communication with one or more base stations, provides information, such as Carrier to Interference ratios (C/I) or Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), to assist base stations in determining modulation type and coding rate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In the exemplary communication systems, the supplemental channels are shared among a plurality of mobile stations (MS), including mobile station <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The base station <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> operates according to an admission control algorithm which determines, when to transmit data packets to a particular mobile station, what modulation type and coding rate is used, which Walsh codes will be assigned to the mobile station, and which base station of the system will transmit. In the exemplary communication system according to 1XEV-DV, the supplemental channels typically comprise up to 16 channels (Walsh channels), wherein any one of the channels may contain a packet of data for a particular mobile station. Each of the Walsh channels is spread using a different Walsh covering. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In the exemplary communication systems, the base station simultaneously transmits a packet of data and signaling information. The signaling information indicates to the mobile station <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> that the packet of data is sent to the mobile station <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The signaling information to determine the processing of supplemental channels, wherein the signaling information comprises the modulation type and the code rate, the Walsh codes that are utilized, and which base station is transmitting on the supplemental channels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The mobile station <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, operable in 1XEV-DO and 1XEV-DV systems, comprises an antenna <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, a front end filter <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, an analog to digital (A/D) converter <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, a Random Access Memory (RAM) <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, a Rake receiver <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, an Interpolator <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, a Master controller <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and a decoder <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. The antenna <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> receives radio frequency (RF) signals (forward link) from the base station <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and from other base stations in the vicinity. The received RF signals are converted to electrical signals by the antenna <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and provided to the front end <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. The front end <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> filters the signals and provides conversion to baseband signals. The baseband signals are provided to the AD converter <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, which converts the baseband signals to digital signals for further processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the an embodiment of the invention, the received signal (also referred to as current frame signal) is stored in Random Access Memory (RAM) <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> prior to any de-spreading of the signal. The RAM <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> comprises first and second buffers <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. In an exemplary embodiment, the first buffer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> may be used to store a current frame signal and the second buffer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> may be used to store a previous frame signal. The master controller <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, coupled to the RAM <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, comprises logic to toggle the use between first buffer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and second buffer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. Because the signal is stored before de-spreading the signal, the memory size requirement is significantly less then if the signal was stored after de-spreading the signal. Since, the converted signal is stored in the buffer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> or buffer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> prior to de-spreading, advantageously system time tick <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> samples per chip may be used. Therefore, for example, the buffer size of first and second buffers, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, may be 98304 bits or 12.3 kbytes, generally calculated using 6144 (chips)&times;2 samples&times;4 bits&times;2 (I and Q) equaling to approximately 98304 bits. It should be noted that size of the RAM <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, the first and second buffers, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, might vary based on the manufacturers desired sampling rate and other factors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The Rake receiver <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is a conventional receiver comprising a sample selector <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, a correlator <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, a Walsh de-spreader <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and a symbol combiner <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. The Rake receiver <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> processes the signal received on the dedicated channel to determine signaling information and sends the signaling information to a master controller <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Using well-know techniques, the Rake receiver <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, extracts all the information necessary for master controller <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> to efficiently evaluate the supplemental channel data stored in RAM <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The signaling information generally comprises an indication that a packet data for a particular mobile station is on the supplemental channel. The signaling information further comprises the Walsh codes, the number of supplemental channel, modulation type and coding rate used by the BS. Additionally, the signaling information may comprise a system time counter, pseudo-random noise states and Long code states. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The master controller <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> comprises logic to control the operations of all the components of the receiver. The master controller <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> includes a clock <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>. The clock controls timing of the mobile station <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The master controller <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is coupled to the other elements of the mobile station <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and such interconnections are not shown so as to not unduly complicate the drawing figure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In an operation of an embodiment of the present invention, for every frame, the conventional rake receiver <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> of the receiver <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, processes the dedicated channel of the received signal. The rake receiver <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> extracts the signaling information for the current frame and sends the signaling information to the master controller <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> via the decoder <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. Simultaneously, the signal, which contains all channels, including the supplemental channels, is stored in RAM <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The master controller <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> determines which one of the buffers, first buffer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> or second buffer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, to use. Generally, one buffer is used to store current frame signal and the other buffer is used to store previous frame data. Simultaneously, the master controller <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> having soft information from the previous frame, replays the previous frame data stored in RAM <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to process the data using the soft information. The master controller <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> only replays the stored data, if the soft information indicates that a packet data for mobile station <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is in the signal received on the supplemental channel. The master controller <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> determines which buffer to use for storing the current frame signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The master controller <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> comprises logic to decode the signaling information comprising the modulation type, coding rate, the Walsh codes assigned to the mobile station and the base station that transmitted the data. Using the Walsh code assignment extracted from the soft information, the master controller <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> processes the control channel and thereafter despreads the supplement channels to extract the data packets as defined in the 1XEV-DO and 1XEV-DV specification. The master controller <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> also comprises logic to control the operation of the interpolator <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> for generating the best sampling instant for the correlator <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. The master controller <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> uses the signaling information from Rake receiver to program the interpolator <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> An interpolator <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> may be single hardware unit, used in a time divisional method (i.e. time shared). The interpolator <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> according to invention, controlled by a master controller <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, for generating best sampling instances. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates flowcharts of tasks, generally shown as <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>, which are executed simultaneously during each frame. In the preferred embodiment of the invention the master controller <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> simultaneously executes tasks, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, and the Rake receiver <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> executes task <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>. Task <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> handles the reception of the communication signal during the current frame <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and task <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> handles the processing of the stored signal. Task <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> handles the extraction of signaling information from the signal received during the current frame. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The signal reception task <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is initiated for every frame upon the raw signal being converted to a digital signal. At block <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, the digitally converted signal is received. At block <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, the received signal is stored in RAM <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> prior to the de-spreading of the signal. When storing the signal in RAM <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, the master controller uses the first buffer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and the second buffer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. In the preferred embodiment, for every frame, master controller <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> toggles the use between the first buffer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and the second buffer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> when storing the received signal. For example, in any given frame the master controller <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may read from the first buffer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and write in the second buffer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, then toggle for the next frame such that master controller <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is now reading from the second frame <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and writing in the first frame <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The signal-processing task <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> is initiated for every frame upon start of each frame. At block <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>, the master controller <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> replays the signal stored in the previous frame (also referred to as, previous frame signal) and processes the stored signal using the signaling information received from the conventional rake receiver <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. At block <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight>, using the signaling information, the master controller <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> determines if there is a data packet for this mobile station on any of the shared supplemental channels. If yes, then at block <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight>, the master controller <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> de-spreads the stored signal using signaling information, such as the Walsh codes and other information. Thereafter, the master controller <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> processes the control channel, the supplemental channel and decodes the data using the signaling information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The signaling information extraction tasks <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> is initiated for every frame upon the raw signal being converted to a digital signal. At block <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight>, the rake receiver <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, using well-known techniques, generally defined in the standards, extracts the signaling information from the dedicated channel of the current frame signal. At block <highlight><bold>274</bold></highlight>, the rake receiver provides the signaling information to the master controller <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a mobile station <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> according to a second embodiment of the present invention. In this Figure, components, which are similar to those described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, have been numbered with like reference numerals. In addition to the components described in the mobile station <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, the mobile station <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> according the second embodiment, further comprises a control channel decoder <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. The control channel decoder is coupled to the analog to digital (A2D) converter <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and master controller <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. In an operation according to the second embodiment, the A2D converter <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> sends the converted signal to the control channel decoder <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, the Rake receiver <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and stores the signal in RAM <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The control channel <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> processes the control channel of the received signal and provides the information to master controller <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> to use during next frame processing. Simultaneously, the Rake receiver <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> processes the received signal to extract signaling information of the current frame. In the second embodiment, the master controller <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, uses the signaling information from Rake receiver <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> to determine is the there is any data packets for this mobile station. </paragraph>

Since master controller <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> receives the control channel information from the control channel decoder <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, the master controller <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> does not process the control channel. At the start of the frame the master controller <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> replays signal and de-spreads the supplement channels to extract the data packets. The data packets are processed according to proposed standards. This embodiment offers an advantage of faster data packet processing, since the control channel decoder <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> processes the control channel information in the previous frame which is used by the master controller <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
