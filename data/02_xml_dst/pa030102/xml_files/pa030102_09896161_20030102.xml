<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The present invention is an method of estimating the frequency of a signal by first receiving a signal, forming a row vector, segmenting the row vector; converting the row vector to a first matrix, multiplying the first matrix by a weight, performing a Fourier transform on the result of the last step. These same steps are repeated on a delayed version of the signal. The next steps are calculating a complex conjugate for each result of the last step, forming a cross-spectrum matrix, selecting a magnitude in the cross-spectrum matrix that is above a threshold; and setting an angular frequency of the signal to either the phase of the selected magnitude, the phase of the mean of the complex numbers in the row in which appears the selected magnitude, or the selected magnitude. The frequency of the signal is then set to the estimated angular frequency divided by the product of 2&pgr; and the signal delay period. Additional rows are processed if need be. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates, in general, to measuring and testing and, in particular, to frequency spectrum analyzer by Fourier analysis. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A classic problem in signal analysis is detecting weak tones in noise and estimating the frequency of the tone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The most common method used in frequency estimation is the Fourier transform. However, the Fourier transform cannot resolve signals that are separated by less than the width of one transform cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Other common methods of frequency estimation are based on phase differentiation of the signal. These methods fail if more than one signal is present. This is because the differential phase is derived from the sum of the signal components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A cross spectral method provides a very accurate frequency estimate in severe noise, but cannot resolve two signals which are not already separated by the Fourier transform on which the method is based. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In a typical two-dimensional Fourier analysis, a signal is sampled to form a first matrix of rows and columns, where each column represents a time segment of data. A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is performed on the columns of the first matrix to form a second matrix. The rows of the second matrix represent frequency and the columns represent time. That is, each row in the second matrix is a time-indexed vector, representing the time-varying spectral response of the signal at the frequency represented by the row. A second FFT is then performed on the rows of the second matrix. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In an FFT method known as the Large FFT method, a sufficient amount of data is selected from a signal of interest to form a vector, an FFT is computed for the vector, the magnitude of each element in the FFT is determined, and the element with the peak magnitude is used to estimate the frequency of the signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In an FFT method known as the Welch&apos;s method, a signal is sampled to form a first matrix of rows and columns. An FFT is performed on the columns of the first matrix to form a second matrix. Each entry in the second matrix is replaced with its absolute value. The rows of the second matrix are then summed. The highest sum (i.e., the peak) is selected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In an FFT method known as the Cross-Power Spectrum method, a signal is sampled to form a first matrix of rows and columns. The signal is then delayed a user-definable period of time. The delayed signal is then sampled to form a second matrix of rows and columns. An FFT is performed on the columns of the first matrix. An FFT is performed on the columns of the second matrix. The results of the two FFTs are multiplied together to form a third matrix. The third matrix is averaged. An amplitude and phase are computed from the averaged matrix. Determine the peak amplitude and calculate the frequency corresponding thereto. The phase of the signal is estimated as being located where the peak amplitude occurs. The frequency of the signal is estimated by interpolation as follows:</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The thirteenth step <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the method is calculating the complex conjugate of each result of the twelfth step <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
