<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Power dividers are known to be functional for dividing a single RF signal into multiple RF signals or, reciprocally, for combining a plurality of phase-coherent RF signals into a single output RF signal. Such known power dividers/combiners are arranged with a fixed number of input/output ports and are designed to accommodate the fixed number of input/output ports. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Single-pole, N-throw RF switches are also known, for connecting a single common port to one of N output ports. Such switches usually connect only a single output port to the input port at any time, other than for brief intervals during switching. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In connection with the present invention reference will generally be made to RF power dividers, it being understood that such dividers are reciprocal device and equally useful as power combiners. Accordingly, the term dividers should be construed to encompass devices applied as either dividers or combiners. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a block diagram of a system which includes parallel power amplifiers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which receive coherent RF signals, generated by signal source <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and divided in equal amplitude and phase relation by RF divider <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The output signals from RF amplifiers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are provided to combiner <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and thereafter to antenna <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Those familiar with RF circuits will recognize that in a conventional system of the type shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, proper operation requires that all amplifiers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> be operating to normal specification, with equal amplifier power and phase. In the event one of the amplifiers, such as amplifier <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>C, should fail, the result will be a possible impedance mismatch at divider <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and a power combining impedance mismatch at combiner <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The resulting signal loss will exceed the power loss normally associated with the failed amplifier, because of the impedance mismatch at the combiner. In the event that one of amplifiers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> fails, or in the event that it is desired to disconnect one of the amplifiers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, it is desirable to reconfigure power divider <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and power combiner <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to isolate the failed amplifier <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>C from the other elements of the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a schematic diagram of a conventional single-pole, N-throw (N&equals;4) RF switch <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> having a signal input port <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and switch selectable output portions <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>C and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>D. In normal applications the switch reeds <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>D and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>D are moved to connect only one of the output ports <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> to the input port <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Because there is only a single connection at any time (except possibly during the switching process), assuming the load on the connected output port <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is equal to the characteristic impedance of the transmission line and source <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, impedance match is achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> If more than one of the output ports <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of switch <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> were connected, the input impedance at input port <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> will be a function of the impedance of all connected output ports. Accordingly, assuming that the output ports are 50 ohm loads, and two output ports are connected, the impedance at input port <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> will be 25 ohms. If all switch reeds <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are moved to the connected position, and 50 ohm loads are provided at each output port, the impedance of input port <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> will be 12&frac12; ohms. Accordingly, activation of more than one switch reed <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> will normally cause a significant change in the input impedance, normally causing a mismatch and power loss by reflection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a plan top view of the inner conductor and reed portions of an RF signal divider <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> drawing depicts the center conductor members of an RF switch assembly whose outer conductor is formed as an RF cavity <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> formed into a RF housing <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, as shown in perspective view in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows the inner conductors of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> in place within cavity <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of housing <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The inner conductor portions shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> include a common input port <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, which is connected to a 50 ohm slab-line inner conductor <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to be mounted within housing <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>. Coaxial output ports <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>C and <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>D connect inner conductor <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> selectively to one or more of output ports <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. According to the number of output ports connected, an input signal provided to input port <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is provided as an output signal to one or more output ports <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. Reeds <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are mechanically moved between open or &ldquo;off&rdquo; positions and closed or &ldquo;on&rdquo; positions by electromagnets in a conventional manner as will be further explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Those skilled in the art will recognize that when a single output port <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is connected to input port <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> by one of switching reads <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, the load presented to input port <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is a match, i.e., <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> ohm, impedance load. As additional output ports <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are connected by switching of their respective switch reeds <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, provisions must be made for impedance matching the input port <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> to the changed load condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> To provide for impedance matching, switchable matching stub reeds <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> are located at selected distances D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and D<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> along slab transmission line <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> from the switching connection point. Each impedance matching reed <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> has a respective impedance matching length L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and L<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, which is selected to provide reactive impedance matching for the power divider when 2, 3 or 4 of output ports <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are connected to transmission line <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> by their respective switching reeds <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Reference is made to the cross-sectional view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, which illustrates a typical configuration for operation of reeds <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and impedance matching reeds <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> of the preferred embodiments of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 through 5</cross-reference>. As shown in the perspective assembly view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, RF housing <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is provided with a cover plate <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to provide an RF assembly <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. A solenoid mounting plate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is secured to cover plate <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and provided with solenoids <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> for activating the switch and impedance matching reeds. A circuit board <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is conveniently mounted above solenoids <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, and includes integrated circuits <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> for providing driving currents in accordance with supplied logic signals representing the desired state of the power divider, provided to terminal <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, and using DC power supplied to terminals <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The cross-sectional view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows a solenoid <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> for driving an armature <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> in a downward direction in response to supplied current. Armature <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> engages nonconducting activating pin <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to move reed <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> from the open switch position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> to a position connecting output terminal <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> to slab-line center conductor <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Those skilled in the art will recognize that the switchable power divider of the present invention can be advantageously used in connection with a multiple solid state amplifier device as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. In connection with such amplifiers it is possible to provide a variable power output signal by selecting less than all of the four power amplifiers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for producing a combined output signal. In this case control logic <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> can control which of amplifiers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are to be activated and, accordingly, set the condition of divider <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and combiner <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>&prime; using driver circuits <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. By control of the switching reeds <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the impedance matching reeds <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, the number of output signals from the divider <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> or input signals to combiner <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can be varied, while maintaining impedance match. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As an additional feature, it is possible to provide a power amplifier system which will have a &ldquo;fail soft&rdquo; characteristic. Monitor couplers <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> are provided at the output of each individual amplifier <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and the monitor signal is provided to detectors <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. Control log <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> responds to a failure of any of amplifiers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to discontinue operation of that amplifier, and reconfigure power divider <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and power combiner <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> for operation with the remaining three amplifiers. Accordingly, the amplifiers continues to function with reduced power output </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> While the present invention has been described with respect to a four-way power divider, those skilled in the art will recognize that the principles of the invention are applicable to N-way dividers and appropriate N&minus;1 matching reads can be provided. In addition, those skilled in the art will recognize that a system of the type shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> can be provided for normal operation with less than all of the amplifiers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, for example three amplifiers, with the fourth amplifier being a stand by amplifier to be substituted in the event of a failure of one of the other units. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> While there as been described what is believed to be the preferred embodiment of the invention, those skilled in the art will recognize that other and further modifications may be made thereto without departing from the spirit of the present invention, and it is intended to claim all such changes and modifications as fall within the true scope of the invention. </paragraph>
