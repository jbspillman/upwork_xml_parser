<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A railcar door assembly includes a drive mechanism operably connected to elongated support members for selectively imparting rotational movement thereto, and a anti-spin/anti-drift mechanism for preventing movement of the drive mechanism beyond defined limits. The drive mechanism includes a gear segment mounted on a bearing plate, and the anti-spin/anti-drift mechanism is comprised of a shaft, a pair of ratchets at opposing ends of the shaft, and a pinion disposed on the shaft between the ratchets with the pinion engaging the gear segment. The pinion is rotated until it engages one of the ratchets for permitting the door to move to a fully opened position and preventing it from moving to a closed position. This arrangement effectively prevents undesired drifting of the door into the side of the railcar itself. Conversely, the pinion is rotated in the opposite direction to engage the other of the ratchets for permitting the door to move to a fully closed position and preventing it from moving to an open position. This prevents a lever which rotates the gear segment from unnecessary spinning. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to the art of railway cars. More particularly, the invention pertains to an anti-spin and anti-drift mechanism for gear operated doors for railway cars. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention is particularly applicable to plug-type metal doors of the type used on railway freight cars and will be particularly described with reference thereto. However, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the invention has broader applications and is adaptable to use on doors used in other environments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Rectangular metal doors of a known type used in railway cars include a generally rectangular frame generally comprised of top, bottom, and opposed side members. Metal panels are secured to these frame members for completing the basic door construction. In most conventional railway cars, the frame members and metal panels are riveted and/or welded together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Railcar doors are typically classified as either sliding doors or plug doors. Of the two, sliding doors are less complex, merely having a door configured to slide back and forth within a side panel of a railcar to selectively open and close an opening defined therein. Plug doors are more complex in that they are configured to first move laterally outward from the opening defined in the railcar, and then move longitudinally along a track disposed adjacent the railcar side panel. The present invention finds particular application to plug-type doors. However, it should be understood that the concept involved is equally applicable to other environments where selective movement of large doors between open and closed positions is required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Plug doors to be mounted on the side of a railcar typically include a series of panels or sheeting reinforced by horizontally disposed channels at the top, bottom and intermediate portions of the door. A pair of vertically oriented elongated support members such as pipes, rods or bars are configured to support the door on the railcar. The support members are typically provided with upper and lower cranks attached to the ends thereof which serve as lever arms for laterally moving the door into and out of the railcar door opening. Upon actuation of a driving means, such as a manually operated gear assembly, the support members are rotated causing corresponding rotation of the cranks. Rotation of the cranks, in turn, draws the door laterally outward from the door opening until the door is supported on a track disposed adjacent the side of the railcar. The door is moveably supported on the track by roller hangers which enable the door to slide longitudinally along the side of the railcar. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> One problem that occurs when the door is completely closed is that if a load falls against the inside wall of the door, an operating lever which controls movement of the door may spin and possibly move the door into an unwanted slightly or fully opened position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A second problem occurs when the door is in the fully opened position. The support members have a tendency to rotate, thus causing the door to drift back into the side of the railcar. If this occurs, the ability of the door to slide longitudinally along the track may be inhibited. Furthermore, the door or the side of the railcar may become damaged because of the drifting action. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it has been considered desirable to develop an anti-spin and anti-drift mechanism for a gear-operated door that addresses the foregoing difficulties and others while providing better and more advantageous overall results. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, an anti-spin/anti-drift mechanism for a gear-operated door is advantageously provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The anti-spin/anti-drift mechanism is particularly suited for use with a railcar door assembly comprised of at least one sheet member having a front surface, laterally disposed channels disposed on the sheet member front surface, and a pair of elongated support members rotatably mounted to the channels via a mounting mechanism. Each support member includes a first rotatable member attached to a support member first end, and a second rotatable member attached to a support member second end. A drive mechanism is operably connected to the pair of elongated support members for selectively imparting rotational movement thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The first and second rotatable members may each comprise a crank with a roller assembly attached at one end thereof. The rollers, in turn, are mounted on the track of an associated railcar to facilitate movement of the railcar door therealong. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> An operating mechanism is operably connected to the drive mechanism for selectively imparting rotation thereto. The operating mechanism comprises an activating member, such as a handle or the like, secured to the shaft. An anti-spin/anti-drift mechanism for preventing movement of the operating mechanism is mounted to the activating member. A pair of transmission members are connected at a first end to the drive mechanism and at a second end to one of the elongated support members. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The drive mechanism may comprise a gear segment. This gear segment is mounted on a bearing plate located on the sheet member. The drive mechanism further includes a pair of operating cams operably connected to both the gear segment and the transmission members. Rotation of the activating member or handle rotates the gear segment, thus causing rotation of the transmission and support members. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The anti-spin/anti-drift mechanism comprises an operating shaft, a pinion and a pair of ratchets. The mechanism is captured between the bearing plate and a cover plate which is spaced apart from and mounted to the bearing plate. The mechanism is attached to the operating lever by threading the lever onto the operating shaft. One of the ratchets prevents unwanted drifting of the door from a fully opened position to a closed position. The other ratchet prevents unwanted spinning of the operating lever to cause movement of the door from a fully closed to an unwanted partially or fully opened position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> A principal advantage of the present invention resides in the provision of an anti-spin/anti-drift mechanism for restricting a movable door from undesired and uncontrolled drifting into the side of an associated railcar. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Another advantage of the invention is found in the provision of an anti-spin/anti-drift mechanism which prevents an operating lever of the door from spinning if a load falls against an inner surface of the door. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Yet another advantage of the present invention is the provision of an anti-spin/anti-drift mechanism which prevents the door from unwanted movement from a closed position to an open position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Still another advantage of the invention is found in the provision of an anti-spin/anti-drift mechanism that enables the door to slide along a door track with minimal difficulty. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Yet another advantage of the present invention is the provision of an anti-spin/anti-drift mechanism that helps prevent damage to a door and/or the side of a railcar due to door drifting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Still another advantage of the invention resides in the provision of an anti-spin/anti-drift mechanism that is relatively low in cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Yet another advantage of the invention is the provision of an anti-spin/anti-drift mechanism that is easy to manufacture and retro-fit onto existing railcar doors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Still other benefits and advantages of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon a reading and understanding of the following detailed specification.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the drawings wherein the showings are for purposes of illustrating a preferred embodiment of the invention only and not for limiting same, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> shows a plug-type railcar door <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> disposed in an opening <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in a railcar in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention. The door includes a wall of paneling or sheeting <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> reinforced with horizontal channels <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> extending across top, bottom and intermediate portions of the sheeting. The sheeting <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is typically fabricated from corrugated metal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The door <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is supported by a pair of elongated support members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, such as pipes, rods or tubes, which are disposed along the vertical height of the door. The support members are rotatably mounted to the horizontal reinforcing channels <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> on an outer surface <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of the door via brackets or fulcrums <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> located near the side edges of the door to retain the support members in a vertical disposition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Each of the support members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> includes a first or upper end having a first or upper crank <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>operatively connected thereto and a second or lower end having a second or lower crank <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>operatively connected thereto. The cranks <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>serve as lever arms which enable the door to move laterally into and out of the railcar opening <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The door <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is adapted to move laterally out of the door opening toward the outside of the railcar until the door is supported on a track <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> disposed adjacent the railcar side wall. The door moves longitudinally along the side of the car on track <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to effectively open the door opening to facilitate car loading and unloading. Thus, when it is in the unplugged position, the door is movably supported on the track <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> by roller hangers <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> which are attached to the ends of the lower cranks <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>for guiding the door during its longitudinal movement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Upper ends of cranks <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>include pins with rollers <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> mounted for longitudinal movement within and along a top retainer rail or longitudinal retainer member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> having a generally c-shaped cross-section. The top retainer rail <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is mounted along the top of the door opening <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and functions to restrain the top of the door and prevent its undesirable displacement. Rollers <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> move along an inner surface of a downwardly depending front flange <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the top retainer rail. The front flange extends longitudinally and is located inside an outer edge of a laterally outward extending lower flange <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> spaced from and located below the front flange. Horizontal connecting portions <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of upper cranks <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>extend through the space between front flange <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and lower flange <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and connect the upper ends of the cranks and their rollers <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> with the upper ends of support members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The rollers <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are disposed behind the retainer rail <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The combination of the rollers <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the retainer rail <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> acts to restrain the top of the car door <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as it is moved longitudinally along the track <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Mounted on the top of the door between the pair of upper cranks <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is an auxiliary crank <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The purpose of the auxiliary crank is to restrain the door against undesired displacement in the event it becomes disengaged from track <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> or is damaged in a manner which makes reliance on the upper cranks <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>difficult. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> As is well understood in the art, rotation of the support members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> will cause a corresponding outward rotation of the cranks <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to sequentially draw the door <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> laterally outward from the door opening. An operating mechanism <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is provided on the door for controlling the rotation of the support members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the cranks. An activating member <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> in the form of a lever with a hole or opening <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> therethrough is secured to the door. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 2</cross-reference>, a drive mechanism <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> which preferably comprises a gear operated system or assembly <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is connected to and actuated via the activating member or lever <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The gear assembly includes a gear segment <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and two operating cams <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, each of which is housed in and positioned between a bearing plate <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and a cover plate <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). The bearing plate <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is mounted on a lower portion of the door sheeting <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and the cover plate is bolted or otherwise mounted into the bearing plate. The cover plate is disposed parallel to and in spaced relation from the bearing plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A, a</cross-reference> pair of transmission members <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, such as pipes, rods or tubes, are connected at first ends to the drive mechanism <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and at second ends to support members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The transmission members are connected to operating cams <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of the gear assembly <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. By rotating the lever <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> counter-clockwise, the gear segment <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is rotated clockwise which, in turn, rotates the operating cams <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> which are connected to and rotate the transmission members <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. This, then, imparts a corresponding rotation to the support members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and cranks <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which, in turn, provides selective lateral movement of the door outwardly from the opening <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> toward the outside of the railcar. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> When the lever <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is rotated clockwise, the gear segment <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> rotates counter-clockwise to rotate operating cams <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and transmission members <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. This, in turn, rotates the support members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and cranks <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to provide lateral movement of the door <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> into the opening <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the railcar. Such movement allows the door to seal or plug the opening. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The channels <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are operatively connected at their axial ends to opposed vertical members <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. A pair of locking rods <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> extend horizontally across the railcar door and are configured to be received in openings <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> in the car. While the door is in the closed position, and as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A, the locking rods <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> extend into openings <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, thereby preventing lateral movement of the door. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>B, the locking rods are split at an intermediate portion and are interconnected via operating cams or links <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and an operating bar <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The operating bar is coupled to the drive mechanism <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> which, when actuated, causes cams or links <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> to rotate about pivot joints <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. Such rotation of the cams pulls the locking rods <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> from openings <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and places the door in an unlocked position where it is free to move in the lateral direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A, 2</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>B, an anti-spin/anti-drift mechanism <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is positioned between the cover and bearing plates. An operating shaft <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> of the mechanism has a threaded member <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> which is threaded through an opening in the cover plate. Operating lever <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is attached to the anti-spin/anti-drift mechanism by inserting a shoulder <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> on the operating shaft <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> through hole <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the lever. A locknut or other retaining device (not shown) retains the lever on the operating shaft. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The anti-spin/anti-drift mechanism further includes a pinion segment <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> which is located between two ratchet assemblies <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. The pinion segment has a threaded opening which threadedly receives the shaft <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. The pinion member can then move along the shaft between the two ratchets. Ratchet assembly <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is positioned on a first end of the shaft <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> adjacent the cover plate, and ratchet assembly <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> is positioned on a second end of the shaft adjacent the bearing plate. The ratchet assemblies <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> are approximately parallel to and in spaced relation from each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Flanges <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference>) are disposed adjacent opposite the ratchet assemblies. Four pins <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> connect the flanges and operating shaft together. A pawl <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> located adjacent the cover plate engages ratchet <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> which allows movement of the ratchet and the lever in the counterclockwise direction to open the door. This pawl allows the ratchet to freely rotate during opening of the door when the operating lever is rotated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> During closing of the door, the lever is rotated clockwise about 15&deg; to 20&deg;, rotating the shaft and the pinion toward the flange <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, until the pinion bottoms out. The pinion then rotates the gear segment, thus closing the door. The pinion also engages or clamps onto the ratchet <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. A pawl <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> located adjacent the bearing plate engages ratchet <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> which allows the ratchet to rotate clockwise during closing of the door. The pawl <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> does not permit the ratchet to rotate in the opposite direction, thus preventing spinning of the lever. If a load is applied to an internal wall of the door, the gear segment has a tendency to rotate, thus attempting to force the pinion to also rotate possibly causing the lever <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> to spin out of control and cause a dangerous or damaging situation. However, the pinion would then bottom out against flange <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> faster than the lever can spin or rotate, thus avoiding a dangerous or damaging situation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> If opening of the door is desired, the lever <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is manually rotated counterclockwise, thus rotating the pinion and disengaging the pinion from ratchet <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. The pinion then rotates toward ratchet <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> until it bottoms out against flange <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. The pinion then engages ratchet <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, and the gear and pinion rotate counterclockwise until the door is fully opened. Pawl <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> engages the ratchet and allows only counterclockwise rotation. Once the door is moved on the track <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the support members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> have a tendency to rotate, thus rotating the cranks <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and thereby potentially allowing the door to move toward the side of the railcar. If the gear starts to rotate clockwise to close the door, the ratchet and pawl stop the rotation. Drifting of the door into the side of the railcar is thereby prevented. </paragraph>
