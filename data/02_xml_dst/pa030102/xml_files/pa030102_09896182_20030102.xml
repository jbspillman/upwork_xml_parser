<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to frequency control devices and, in particular, to a surface mounted crystal resonator based oscillator assembly contained in two separate but joined housings. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Frequency control devices are an essential component for many types of mobile communication equipment such as portable telephones, pagers, wireless modems, and personal digital assistants (PDA). To produce a base frequency of oscillation, an electronic oscillator circuit is employed that will typically include a piezoelectric device. Piezoelectric devices can be designed to mechanically resonate at very precise and repeatable frequencies, and this mechanical resonance is translated by the device to an electrical signal. Electrodes are formed upon the surface of the piezoelectric device which enable the application or pick-up of an electric field across some part of the piezoelectric device. In response to electrical stimulation, the piezoelectric device will change physical shape, and when the electrical signal is at the mechanical resonant frequency of the piezoelectric device, energy lost through the piezoelectric device is at a minimum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Electronic oscillator circuits are typically associated with these piezoelectric devices that set up a basic oscillation, and the piezoelectric device is then used to predicably control the frequency at which the oscillator circuit will be resonant. The mechanical properties of the piezoelectric device are obviously important to the proper functioning of the oscillator, and to accurate frequency control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Many factors can substantially effect the mechanical properties of a piezoelectric device such as the shape of the piezoelectric material used to make the device, environmental factors including temperature, humidity, and mechanical shock, as well as contamination of the piezoelectric material by minute particles that may contact the surface of the piezoelectric device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In order to avoid these problems, high quality resonators are generally manufactured in very clean environments such as clean rooms, and are most preferably packaged into a sealed container free of any possible contaminants of corrosive compounds. With regard to the attempts to minimize the effects of temperature, one approach has been to include electrical components or trimming components that compensate for known variations in the frequency of oscillation of the piezoelectric device through a certain temperature range. Crystal oscillators that include such electrical components are referred to as temperature compensated crystal oscillators (TCXO), and are the subject of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> An example of a TCXO package manufactured for portable wireless applications is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,949,294. The TCXO package shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,949,294 consists of a bottom compartment with a cavity facing upwards, and a top compartment (the crystal resonator assembly), also with a cavity facing upwards. The top compartment is attached to the bottom compartment by metallic connections on the top surface of the bottom compartment and the bottom surface of the top compartment respectively. The top compartment cavity is sealed by a shield plate, and the bottom compartment cavity is sealed by the top compartment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> There are a number of disadvantages with such a stacked TCXO package design. If the cavity of the lower compartment is not potted, the cavity can trap liquids, such as condensed humidity, in the space between the bottom of the cavity and the bottom surface of the top compartment. Another problem with the prior art design is that the size of the TCXO package cannot be minimized substantially without encountering problems. For example, in order to reduce the overall height of the assembled package, attempts have been made to reduce the height of the components placed in the lower compartment, and also by reducing the layer thickness of the sheets that form the bottom compartment. This has resulted in decreased mechanical strength, diminished light blocking, and reduced numbers of possible interconnections between the top and bottom compartments. Another problem with such an arrangement is a lack of design flexibility. Specifically, in this configuration, the crystal resonator assembly must be of sufficient size to seal the bottom compartment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> An alternative design for a TXCO package is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,438,219 commonly owned by the present assignee. U.S. Pat. No. 5,438,219 shows a one piece double sided TXCO package having an open top receptacle adapted to receive electronic components and an open bottom receptacle adapted to receive a piezoelectric element and a cover for hermetically sealing the open bottom receptacle. The electronic components and piezoelectric element are electrically connected. A hermetic environment is established by coupling the cover and open bottom receptacle. When viewed in cross section the TXCO package resembles a one piece H-shaped housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> While the TXCO package of U.S. Pat. No. 5,438,219 alleviates many of the problems with the package described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,949,294, the one piece H-shaped housing creates other problems. Many of these problems comes from the difficulties in manufacturing the one piece H-shaped housing. For example, manufacturing a one piece H-shaped housing involves flipping over the ceramic package that typically makes up the housing. This flipping requires special tooling and necessitates extra handling that could lead to contamination of the piezoelectric element. The flipping also means that one must compensate for sag in the middle of the package cavity similar to the sag in a hammock strung between two posts. Another problem with the one piece H-shaped housing is that there is very little flexibility in creating different size TXCO&apos;s for different applications because the entire housing must be constructed in a single process as opposed to changing just the resonator housing or the oscillator housing. Yet another shortcoming of the one-piece double sided housing design is that if mistakes in assembly are made, entire fabrications must be disposed of. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a packaged resonator and oscillator assembly suitable for use as a double-sided temperature compensated TXCO package. The resonator and the oscillator are in separate but joined housings, and are in electrical communication with one another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The resonator housing comprises a base having a first or an internal surface, a second or external surface, and sidewalls adjacent to the base of the resonator housing that extend upwardly away from the resonator base. Preferably the sidewalls extend upwardly away from the resonator base in a substantially perpendicular manner. The resonator base and sidewalls form a resonator cavity, which is adapted to receive at least one piezoelectric component, and a cover that is coupled with the resonator sidewalls to form a hermetic enclosure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The separately manufactured oscillator housing comprises, a base having first and second surfaces, and sidewalls adjacent to the oscillator base extending upwardly away from the oscillator base, preferably in a substantially perpendicular manner. The oscillator base and sidewalls form an oscillator cavity. This oscillator cavity is adapted to receive at least one electronic component, such as a flip chip integrated circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The resonator housing and the oscillator housing are preferably manufactured separately. After the resonator housing and oscillation housing are completed, the external surfaces of the respective bases, i.e., the second surface of the resonator housing base and the second surface of the oscillator housing base, are then joined together such that the piezoelectric component in the resonator housing and the electronic component in the oscillator housing are electrically connected. The electric connection between the resonator housing and the oscillator housing may be accomplished by electrical contacts or lands formed on the external surface of the resonator housing base and the external surface of the oscillator housing base. These electronic contacts may be connected by bonding pads, which may typically be connected by solder, conductive adhesive, ultrasonic or thermosonic welds, a solder ball, or the like. These electrical contacts may alternatively be connected directly by solder, solder ball, conductive adhesive, welding, or the like. Conductive vias extending through the oscillator housing base connect the electronic component in the oscillator housing to the electrical contacts or lands on the oscillator external surface. Conductive vias extending through the resonator housing base also connect the piezoelectric component in the resonator housing with the electrical contacts or lands on the resonator external surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> When completed, the present invention forms a substantially H-shaped TXCO package in cross-section, depending upon the individual dimensions of the respective housings. This TXCO package avoids the problems of the stacked TXCO discussed above in connection with U.S. Pat. No. 5,949,294. The two piece construction also avoid the manufacturing problems encountered with a one piece H-shaped housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The package embodying the present invention permits the resonator housing and the oscillator housing to be fabricated separately, and even in separate locations at different times. Because the resonator housing and the oscillator housing can be manufactured separately, conventional manufacturing equipment may be utilized at a substantial cost saving over specialized manufacturing equipment that is required for a one piece, monolithic H-shaped housing. For example, the oscillator housing may be built using conventional array or panel manufacturing processes. Resonator or crystal units from a multiplicity of sources may also be used and attached to the oscillator section without design changes. The separate assembly also enables greater flexibility in mixing and matching different size resonator housings with different size oscillation housings depending on the particular application and available space. The additional concern about compensating for sag in the middle of the package cavity is also eliminated because both the resonator and oscillator housings can be laid flat on their respective bases during the manufacturing process. Also, there is no need for the additional step of flipping the housings over after either the resonator half or oscillator half of a one piece H-shaped housing is completed.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The invention disclosed herein is susceptible to embodiment in many different forms. Shown in the drawings and described in detail hereinbelow are certain preferred embodiments of the present invention. The present disclosure is only an exemplification of the principles and features of the invention, and does not limit the invention to the illustrated embodiments. For ease of description, the crystal resonator based oscillator of this invention will be described as it is depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, and terms such as upper, lower, top, bottom, vertical, horizontal, etc. will be used with reference to that alignment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> double sided temperature compensated oscillator package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprising a resonator housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and an oscillator housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is illustrated. This package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes generally a temperature compensation circuit, having temperature-responsive components, coupled to a base <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in the oscillator housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. This package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is also adapted to receive a piezoelectric component <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> mounted onto a portion of the package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the resonator housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The resonator housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> comprises a base <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> having a first or internal surface <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and a second or external surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Sidewalls <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are adjacent to and surround the base <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the resonator housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, extending upwardly, i.e., away from the base <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, preferably substantially perpendicularly therefrom. The resonator base <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and sidewalls <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> form a resonator cavity <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, which is adapted to receive at least one piezoelectric component <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. A cover <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is coupled with the resonator sidewalls <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to form a hermetic enclosure for the resonator cavity <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> While the resonator housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes at least the piezoelectric component <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, it can also include other components, if desired. The material of construction for the piezoelectric component <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> can vary widely. Examples include quartz, AT-cut quartz strip, and the like. In a preferred embodiment, the piezoelectric component <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> comprises an AT-cut quartz strip for a well-behaved frequency versus temperature relationship from about &minus;40&deg; C. to about 90&deg; C., that may be compensated for electronically. Having the piezoelectric component <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> isolated from the other components minimizes the possibility of contaminating the piezoelectric component <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, resulting in an undesirable alteration of its frequency. More particularly, isolating and physically separating the piezoelectric component <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in the resonator housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> from the electronic components in the oscillator housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, substantially minimizes the possibility of solder, organic underfill, or other unwanted contaminants from adversely affecting the output frequency of the piezoelectric component <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, as can occur over time in prior art TCXO packages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Referring to both <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, the piezoelectric component <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is positioned on and coupled to couplings <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. The couplings <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> provide mechanical and electrical connections to the piezoelectric component <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Electrically connected to the couplings <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> are leads <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), preferably in the form of conductive tungsten filled vias, for connecting the piezoelectric component to the resonator electrical contacts <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, formed on the resonator second or external surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The coupling <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> preferably includes a wraparound section <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) electrically connecting an outwardly facing electrode <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> (top electrode) of the piezoelectric component <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> with lead <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). Similarly, the coupling <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> electrically connects an inwardly facing electrode <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> (bottom electrode facing the resonator first surface <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>) with lead <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Alternatively, piezoelectric component <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be supported across ledges (not shown) within the resonator cavity <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, and an electrical connection may be made therebetween. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The cover <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) is complementary to resonator sidewalls <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and is configured to be received and coupled to the resonator housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and specifically to a peripheral wall portion <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>. The cover <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> can be seam welded or solder sealed to the resonator sidewalls <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and preferably to the peripheral wall portion <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>, to provide a hermetic seal. More particularly, the peripheral wall portion <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> and an outer periphery <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> of cover <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are complementarily configured to provide a secure interconnection and hermetic seal of the contents in the resonator housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The oscillator housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> comprises an oscillator base <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> having a first or internal surface <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and a second or external surface <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Oscillator sidewalls <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are adjacent to and surround the oscillator base <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and extend upwardly, i.e., away from the base, preferably substantially perpendicularly therefrom. The oscillator base <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and oscillator sidewalls <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> form an oscillator cavity <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. This oscillator cavity <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is adapted to receive at least one electronic component, such as an integrated circuit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Other electronic components preferably include chip capacitators <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. It is also preferred that an organic underfill <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> be included in the oscillator cavity <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The integrated circuit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can include any suitable integrated circuit, for example, a wire bonded integrated circuit including a glob top, a flip chip integrated circuit including an organic underfill or the like. In a preferred embodiment, the integrated circuit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is a flip chip including an organic underfill <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> for secure coupling of the integrated circuit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to the oscillator first or internal surface <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, and for minimizing contamination to the integrated circuit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the integrated circuit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is attached by solder reflow onto the oscillator base first surface <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. This solder reflow preferably provides an electrical as well as mechanical connection of the integrated circuit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to oscillator base <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Referring to both <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the oscillator housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> also includes sufficient space for conductive pads <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) adapted for tuning the piezoelectric component <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and first and second chip capacitors <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> which typically function as DC voltage bypass capacitors. The integrated circuit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> itself supplies the temperature compensation function. A plurality of internal leads <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> (shown as dashed lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) are included in the oscillator housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for coupling the electrical components, such as the integrated circuit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and chip capacitators <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> to one or more oscillator electrical contacts <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> formed at the oscillator second surface <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). Leads <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> are coupled to a plurality of respective contacts <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> on the oscillator housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and more particularly on an upper peripheral surface <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> of the oscillator housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the upper peripheral surface <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is substantially planar so as to provide a good contact to a circuit board (not shown) to which it will be connected. The internal leads <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> are formed in the oscillator base <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the oscillator sidewalls <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Thus, the plurality of conductive leads or paths <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> extend from the oscillator first surface <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> to the upper peripheral surface <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, with each lead being insulated from its adjacent lead. The leads <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> provide electrical paths from the circuitry to the upper peripheral surface <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> and contacts <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>, and preferably include co-fired vias within the ceramic itself, or can include plated half holes <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>), called castellations on the outside of the oscillator side walls <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Another set of internal leads <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> connect the capacitators <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> to electrical contacts <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the resonator housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the oscillator housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are manufactured separately. Then the second or exterior surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the resonator housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and second or exterior surface <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the oscillator housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are joined together such that the piezoelectric component <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in the resonator housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the electronic component in the oscillator housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, such as integrated circuit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, are electrically connected. The electric connection between the resonator housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the oscillator housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be accomplished via electrical contacts such as lands <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> provided at the resonator second surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and electrical contacts such as lands <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> provided at the oscillator second surface <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. A set of internal leads <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> connect the integrated circuit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and chip capacitors <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> in the oscillator housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> with the electrical contacts <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>.

Similarly, the oscillator bonding pads <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> may be formed on the oscillator second surface <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and are electrically connected to the oscillator electric contacts <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>. The means for attaching the bonding pads may typically be formed by solder, conductive adhesive, ultrasonic or thermosonic welds, a solder ball or the like. Alternatively, the oscillator bonding pads <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> and resonator bonding pads <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> may be omitted, and the resonator electrical contacts <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and the oscillator electrical contacts <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> may be mechanically and electrically connected directly by solder, a solder ball, conductive adhesive, or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> When assembled, the joined two piece temperature compensated crystal oscillator package forms a substantially H-shaped cross section as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. With the present invention, a variety of different sized resonator housings can be combined with a variety of oscillator housings. Examples of such alternative combinations are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows an alternative double sided temperature compensated oscillator package <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> comprising a resonator housing <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and an oscillator housing <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. This package <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> includes generally a temperature compensation circuit <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, having temperature-responsive components, coupled to a base <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> in the oscillator housing <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. This package <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is also adapted to receive a piezoelectric component <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> mounted onto a base <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> in the resonator housing <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the resonator housing <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of package <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is of larger width than the oscillator housing <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows yet another alternative double sided temperature compensated oscillator package <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> comprising a resonator housing <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and an oscillator housing <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. This package <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> also generally includes a temperature compensation circuit <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, coupled to a base <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> in the oscillator housing <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, and is adapted to receive a piezoelectric component <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> mounted onto base <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> in the resonator housing <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the resonator housing <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> of package <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is of smaller width than the oscillator housing <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Although the FIGURES provided show the geometry of the package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to be substantially square, the exact geometries and dimensions of the housings that constitute package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can vary widely. Package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is particularly adapted for miniaturization. For example, package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may have dimensions of only 5 mm&times;7 mm&times;1.5 mm in one particular embodiment. As a result, package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is adapted for placement in an electronic device where it will typically take up a small portion of the total volume of the electronic device. The height of resonator sidewalls <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> will preferably be sufficient to enclose piezoelectric component <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and to minimize stray or unwanted capacitances between piezoelectric component <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and associated electronic circuitry. Similarly, the height of oscillator sidewalls <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> will preferably be sufficient to enclose electronic components <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, and also to minimize stray or unwanted contact with associated circuitry. Depending on the particular use, package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be shaped geometrically differently to accommodate differing design needs. Electronic components <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> can be potted if desired. In such cases oscillator cavity <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is sized to contain a sufficient amount of a potting compound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is manufactured from materials having substantially similar thermal expansion coefficients, to minimize stresses. Fired or co-fired ceramic materials such as alumina, produced for example through various casting or pressing techniques and having refractory, thick film or thin film metallizations, are suitable materials for the resonator housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and oscillator housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. These materials are preferred, but it is known in the art that many other materials of construction exist that may also perform satisfactorily, as do many processing techniques. Alloys of nickel, iron and cobalt sold under the trademark Kovar, or Alloy 42 and the like, but preferably Kovar, because of its coefficient of thermal expansion is substantially similar to the preferred ceramic material of resonator housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, may be used to form cover <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> After components are mounted and the encapsulant cured, TCXO package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is frequency tuned. Mass loading of piezoelectric component <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> decreases the frequency of resonance until a desired frequency is achieved. During the process of tuning, additional metal is added to the outwardly facing surface of piezoelectric component <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, ion milling may be performed to tune the piezoelectric component <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> by removing material. The possibility of unwanted metal contacting and adversely affecting other electronic components in resonator cavity <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is eliminated in the preferred embodiment because these components are isolated from the other electronic components in the oscillator cavity <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. These additional components may not even be coupled to package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> until the tuning has been completed, depending on the manufacturing sequence selected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The method for making package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> generally includes: (1) assembling a resonator housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>; (2) assembling an oscillator housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>; and (3) joining mechanically as well as electrically the resonator housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with the oscillator housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Assembly of the resonator housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> generally includes: (1) providing an unassembled resonator housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>; (2) providing compliant crystal couplings <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> on the resonator first surface <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>; (3) placing piezoelectric component <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> into resonator cavity <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>; (4) frequency tuning piezoelectric component <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>; and (5) hermetically sealing resonator housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with cover <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Assembly of the oscillator housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> generally includes: (1) providing an unassembled oscillator housing (2) stenciling solder or adhesive onto oscillator first surface <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>; (3) reflowing the solder or curing the adhesive; (4) wirebonding, where necessary, any components to mating conductors on oscillator first surface <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>; (5) dispensing a potting compound or encapsulant such as epoxy resin substantially over the components <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>; and (6) curing the encapsulant. Once the package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has been assembled, the package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is tested and may be suitably coupled to a circuit board (not shown) for use in an electronic device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The foregoing description and the drawings are illustrative of the present invention and are not to be taken as limiting.
