<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to power management in a mobile communication device and more particularly to a system for managing power in a mobile communication device for emergency purposes. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> As the mobile information society grows, there is an increasing demand for mobile phones and other mobile communication devices. As the physical size of mobile phones and costs for these devices shrink, their proliferation in our society will sharply increase. Proliferation is not narrowly focused to certain market segments, but rather more evenly distributed among many diverse markets. Our society is becoming increasingly dependent on these portable communication devices for business, socializing, entertainment and most importantly for the security they provide. For example, parents want their children to have a mobile phone handy especially in an emergency and want to be able to contact them regardless of their location and know that they are safe. Likewise, senior citizens are carrying mobile phone in increasing numbers primarily because of the security they provide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> One common requirement among all mobile communication devices is readily available battery power lasting as long as possible. Rechargeable batteries that easily connect to mobile phones and provide for many hours of air-time are common. But regardless of how long a particular manufacturer&apos;s battery lasts, it will eventually dissipate and cease to provide the mobile communication device with sufficient power. When battery power has been used completely, the mobile communication device will not operate until the battery is recharged or replaced. Generally, it&apos;s a minor inconvenience to a user if the user is not able to use the mobile communication device due to lack of battery power when used for social or entertainment reasons. However, it is very inconvenient and possibly life threatening if the user is not able to use the mobile communication device in case of an emergency. It is especially inconvenient for user of the mobile communication device to manually manage the battery power to insure that electronic device will be operable if need for emergency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Since safety is your most important call and your least expected call to make, it would be wise to include functionality on the mobile communication device to intelligently manage power such that power would always be available in the event of an emergency. Existing mobile phones show available battery power to the user, but do not provide a means for saving minimum battery power to make emergency calls in the event of a true emergency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Therefore, it would be useful if a method was provided that would reserve minimum battery power to make an emergency call. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The present invention advantageously provides a system and a method in an electronic device, such as a mobile terminal, for reserving enough battery power to make emergency calls. The method further provides the user with an indication when there is only enough available power to make emergency calls. When a user is aware that only enough power exists to make emergency calls, the cautious user will refrain from making calls for entertainment or convenience purposes in case of an unexpected emergency. The invention additionally provides for a system and method to restrict the user, if necessary, to making and receiving emergency calls when there is limited power available to the mobile communication device. Once the battery power reaches a minimum threshold, the electronic device may be restricted to use a set of pre-programmed phone numbers, such as &ldquo;911&rdquo; for US or other emergency numbers. For example, a parent or employer may choose to restrict calls for a child or employee, respectively, to a set of emergency pre-programmed numbers when only minimal battery power is available. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A more complete appreciation of all the advantages and scope of the present invention can be obtained from the accompanying drawings, the following detailed description of the invention, and the appended claims.</paragraph>

In an embodiment of the invention, the method comprises operating instructions that are stored in memory <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and are executed by processor <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. Once the primary power source <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and secondary power source <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> have been charged and connected with the mobile communication device, according to block <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> the device may be used by a user with unrestricted access to normal functionality. Normal functionality of a mobile communication device may include but is not limited to: placing and receiving phone calls, text messaging such as sending and receiving emails and paging. According to block <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>, power is received by the mobile communication device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> during normal operation from the primary power source <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. According to block <highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight>, the mobile communication device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> continuously monitors available power on the primary power source <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. According to block <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>, if the available power on the primary power source <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is not below a threshold, then the user may continue to use the mobile communication device normally. The threshold described herein is typically but not necessarily the quantity of power required by the mobile communication device from the primary power source <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to allow normal operation of the device. According to an embodiment of the invention, this threshold may be variable and may be pre-programmed by the manufacturer of the mobile communication device or the user. However, if the available power on the primary power source <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is below a threshold, perform block <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight>. In block <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight>, the mobile communication device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> switches from the primary power source <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to the secondary power source <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in case emergency calls are required. In block <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight>, the mobile communication device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may limit the functionality available to the user to conserve power in case the device must be used in an emergency. For example, the functionality of the mobile communication device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be limited to placing or receiving a call wherein the call is associated with the pre-selected list of subscriber numbers. It should be noted that other limitation may be added by the user or the manufacturer of the mobile communication device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> without departing from the invention. In block <highlight><bold>607</bold></highlight>, phone calls made from the mobile communication device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be limited by the device to a pre-programmed set of emergency numbers. In block <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight>, incoming phone calls from a second communication device <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> are accepted if the second communication device subscriber number <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is located in pre-selected list of at least one subscriber number <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> located on the mobile communication device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates a method of optionally restricting incoming or outgoing calls by the mobile communication device to a pre-selected list of at least one subscriber number <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. In an embodiment of the invention, the method comprises operating instructions that are stored in memory <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and are executed by processor <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. In block <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight>, an administrator programs a set of emergency subscriber numbers into the mobile communication device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> during normal mode. In normal mode the mobile communication device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> operates normally providing all available functionality to the user. The administrator may be the owner of the mobile communication device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> or one who has authority from the owner of the device to add, edit and delete phone numbers from the emergency set of phone numbers. For example, the administrator may be a parent of a child who uses the mobile communication device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> for security. In block <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>, the administrator may configure the device to restrict incoming or outgoing calls when the device is in emergency mode to the pre-programmed set of at least one emergency number programmed in block <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight>. In the emergency mode, the mobile communication device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> has limited available power sufficient to place and receive emergency calls and possibly provide some other minimal device functionality. In block <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight>, the mobile communication device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> switches to emergency mode due to power reaching a pre-selected threshold on the primary power source <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. In block <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>, if calls were restricted in block <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> by the administrator to the pre-selected list of at least one emergency number <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, then perform block <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight>. In block <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>, if calls were not restricted in block <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> by the administrator to the pre-selected list of emergency phone numbers, then perform block <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight>. In block <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight>, the user is not restricted by the mobile communication device to the pre-selected list of emergency numbers <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> while in emergency mode. In block <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight>, the user is restricted to the pre-selected list of emergency numbers programmed in block <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> in case an emergency call is required while the mobile communication device is in emergency mode. </paragraph>
