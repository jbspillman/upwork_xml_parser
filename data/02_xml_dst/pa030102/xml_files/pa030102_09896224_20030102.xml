<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to a method for hydrodesulfurizing crude oil. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Crude oil is conventionally processed by distillation followed by various cracking, solvent refining and hydroconversion processes to produce a desired slate of fuels, lubricating oil products, chemicals, chemical feedstocks and the like. An example conventional process includes distillation of a crude oil in an atmospheric distillation column to form a gas oil, naphtha, a gaseous product, and a atmospheric residuum. Generally, the atmospheric residuum is further fractionated in a vacuum distillation column to produce a vacuum gas oil and a vacuum residuum. The vacuum gas oil is usually cracked to more valuable light transportation fuel products by fluid catalytic cracking or hydrocracking. The vacuum residuum may be further treated to recover a higher amount of useful products. Such upgrading methods may include one or more of, for example, residuum hydrotreating, residuum fluid catalytic cracking, coking, and solvent deasphalting. Streams recovered from crude distillation at the boiling point of fuels have characteristically been used directly as fuels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,885,080 teaches preparing a synthetic crude oil by fractionating a heavy crude oil, hydrodesulfurizing the distillate cut, hydrodemetallizing the residuum and combining the hydrotreated cuts with a third liquid fraction to form the synthetic crude oil. U.S. Pat. No. 3,830,731 teaches distilling a heavy hydrocarbon feedstock into a vacuum gas oil and a vacuum residuum fraction, and hydrodesulfurizing each fraction. However, increasingly tighter regulations on contaminant in fuels, particularly sulfur and aromatics, have forced many refiners to hydrorefine most and often all, of the fuel products. To meet the more stringent requirements for low sulfur diesel, refiners have added naphtha hydrotreaters for removing sulfur and nitrogen compounds from at least some of the refinery streams which go to make up the gasoline pool. In response to the more stringent requirements for clean diesel fuels, refiners have added diesel hydrotreaters for making the low sulfur, low aromatics diesel which are now preferred, and often required. More refiners are building hydrocrackers due to their ability to produce high quality low sulfur fuels. The light gaseous products processed in a refinery are generally treated to remove H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>S and others sulfur containing components prior to use of the gaseous products for energy, as petrochemical feedstocks, as reforming feedstocks for making synthesis gas, or as building blocks for turning the gaseous products into higher molecular weight products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Thus, in response to these tightening regulations, refiners have constructed separate hydroprocessing units to upgrade each of the fuel streams produced in the refinery. The net effect is a large number of similar processing units, each handling a separate stream, requiring additional tankage and operators. Specific streams are alternatively heated for reaction or fractionation, and then cooled for separation and storage. Multiple reaction systems requires multiple hydrogen supply, pressurization and distribution systems. It is desirable to have a process for hydroprocessing the entire crude oil into useful low aromatic, low sulfur products while significantly reducing the number of refinery processing steps and processing equipment required to convert the crude to useful products. Such a process is the subject of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In U.S. Pat. No. 5,009,768, a complete crude or the atmospheric and vacuum residues thereof mixed with vacuum gas oils is demetallized and the demetallized product hydrotreated for hydrodenitrogenation and hydroconversion. In U.S. Pat. No. 5,382,349, a heavy hydrocarbon oil is hydrotreated, the hydrotreated oil distilled and a vacuum residue thermally hydrocracked in a slurry bed. U.S. Pat. No. 5,851,381 provides a method of refining crude oil by distillation and desulfurization. In the method, a naphtha fraction is separated from crude oil by distillation, with the remaining residual fraction after the naphtha fraction has been removed from the crude oil being hydrodesulfurized and the hydrodesulfurized fraction separated into further fractions, first in a high pressure separator and then by atmospheric distillation. A residue is further upgraded in a residue fluid catalytic cracking process. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In the present process, a crude oil feed is desulfurized and processed (hydrotreated and hydrocracked) to form low sulfur, low aromatic fuels in an integrated unit, with a single hydrogen supply and recovery loop, with minimal cooling of intermediate products, and without tank storage of intermediate products. The integrated unit comprises a series of catalytic reaction zones, each containing a single catalyst or a layered catalyst system selected for a particular application, whether it be desulfurization of a crude feed, hydrocracking a gas oil stream or hydrotreating a particular stream to reduce the aromatic and/or sulfur content of the stream to low levels. Flash separation of reaction products exiting a particular catalytic reaction zone is tailored to isolate hydrogen with minimal heat exchange beyond that required to prepare the reaction products for the next processing step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, a crude oil feed is passed directly to a crude desulfurization unit for desulfurization. The crude oil feed may be desalted and volatile materials removed prior to desulfurization, but a substantial portion of the crude oil feed is subjected to desulfurization in a desulfurization reaction zone. A number of reactions is expected to occur during the desulfurization process. Portions of the crude oil feed which contain metal-containing components will be at least partially demetallized during the desulfurization process. Likewise, nitrogen and oxygen are removed, along with sulfur, during the desulfurization process. While the amount of cracked products produced during desulfurization will be relatively small, some amount of larger molecules will be cracked to lower molecular weight products during the desulfurization process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The desulfurized crude oil temperature is adjusted for fractionation, and a gas oil fraction isolated. The gas oil fraction is available for use directly as a fuel. Preferably, the gas oil fraction is further hydrotreated for additional sulfur, nitrogen and/or aromatic removal. Yields of desirable fuel products are increased in the present process when the desulfurized crude oil product is fractionated, preferably in a multi-stage fractionation zone having atmospheric and vacuum distillation columns. Products from multi-stage distillation include a light gas oil fraction, a vacuum gas oil fraction and a residual fraction. The light gas oil fraction, generally having a normal boiling of less than 700&deg; F., may be used directly as a fuel, or further hydroconverted for improved fuel properties. The vacuum gas oil fraction is hydrocracked to increase the fuel yield in the present process and to further improve fuel properties. Single or multi-stage hydrocracking reactors may be employed. The hydrocracked products includes at least one low sulfur fuel product, which may be isolated from a step of distilling the hydrocracked products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, a process is provided for hydrodesulfurizing a crude oil feed in a crude desulfurization unit, separating the desulfurized crude oil and isolating a light gas oil fraction, a vacuum gas oil fraction and a residual fraction, hydrocracking the vacuum gas oil to form at least one low sulfur fuel product; and hydrotreating the light gas oil fraction. This entire integrated process may be conducted without using tank storage of intermediate products, such as a desulfurized crude oil, a light gas oil fraction, and a vacuum gas oil fraction. Further, with no required tank storage of intermediate products, the preferred process can be conducted without cooling of the intermediate products, thus reducing the operating cost of the process. In a further cost savings, the hydroconversion steps of the present process, including crude desulfurization, hydrocracking and hydrotreating, are suitably conducted using a single hydrogen supply loop, thus further reducing the capital and operating cost of the process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides an integrated refining system for processing a whole crude, or a substantial portion of a whole crude, into a full range of product materials at high selectivities and high yields of the desired products. The integrated process of the present invention further provides a series of reaction zones, containing catalysts of varying pore volume, for successively converting progressively lighter and cleaner products in the production of fuel products. The integrated process further provides an method for isolating, purifying and providing hydrogen to the various conversion reaction zones through the use of a single hydrogen isolation and pressurization unit. Among other factors, the present invention is based on an improved understanding of hydroconversion processes, permitting more efficient use of a combination of units for reaction, for product isolation, for hydrogen isolation and recycle, and for energy usage in the preparation of fuels from a crude feed. In the process, a wide range of fuel oil products can be safely prepared with a small number of reaction vessels and product recovery vessels, and with a minimum number of supporting vessels, for handling hydrogen and intermediate products, and employing a minimum number of operators. In effect, the present invention is based on the novel combination of crude desulfurization tailored to a wide boiling range feed, followed by distillation to form a few distillate streams, and bulk upgrading in an integrated hydrocracking/hydrotreating process to form a wide range of useful fuel and lubricating oil base stock products. The present process provides an efficient and less costly alternative to the conventional refinery practice of separating a crude oil feed into a number of distillate and residuum fractions, each of which are processed individually in similar but separate upgrading processes. </paragraph>

In such a distillation, the following fractions are isolated from the crude oil feed: one or more naphtha fractions boiling in the range of from 30 to 220&deg; C., one or more kerosene fractions boiling in the range of from 120 to 300&deg; C. and one or more diesel fractions boiling in the range of from 170 to 370&deg; C. The boiling point ranges of the various product fractions isolated in any particular refinery will vary with such factors as the characteristics of the crude oil source, refinery local markets, product prices, etc. Reference is made to ASTM standards D-975 and D-3699-83 for further details on kerosene and diesel fuel properties. The term &ldquo;hydrocarbon fuel&rdquo; is to be taken as a reference to either one or a mixture of naphtha and middle distillates. Unless otherwise specified, all distillation temperatures listed herein refer to normal boiling point and normal boiling range temperatures. By &ldquo;normal&rdquo; is meant a boiling point or boiling range based on a distillation at one atmosphere pressure, such as that determined in a D1160 distillation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;hydrotreating&rdquo; as used herein refers to a catalyst process wherein a suitable hydrocarbon-based feed stream is contacted with a hydrogen-containing treat gas in the presence of suitable catalysts for removing heteroatoms, such as sulfur and nitrogen and for some hydrogenation of aromatics. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Crude Desulfurization Unit </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The crude oil feed to the present process is generally a whole crude which has not been substantially separated into individual fractions. Removing volatile gases and light liquids (including C<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>to C<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>hydrocarbons) prior to introducing the crude oil feed to the crude desulfurization unit is generally preferred. The crude oil feed is also treated in a desalting unit prior to desulfurization. The full benefits of the practice of the invention are equally realized if a naphtha fraction is removed from the crude oil feed prior to treating in the crude desulfurization unit. </paragraph>

Crude desulfurization unit <highlight><bold>04</bold></highlight> comprises one or more reaction zones, each of which contains one or more catalyst beds. The crude desulfurization unit removes a substantial portion of the contaminants present in the crude oil feed, including metals, sulfur, nitrogen and Conradson carbon. Catalysts provided in crude desulfurization unit <highlight><bold>04</bold></highlight> for removing these contaminants may include a single catalyst or a layered catalyst system comprising multiple catalysts present in one or more reactors. When using a reaction train comprising more than one reactor in series operation, a major portion, if not all, of the liquid product from each reactor (except the last reactor vessel in the reaction train) is passed to a next reactor for additional processing. In the layered catalyst system, catalysts are preselected for their intended specific use, whether it be demetallation, or sulfur and nitrogen removal, or asphaltene and Conradson carbon removal, or mild conversion. Different catalyst layers may also be selected to facilitate the desulfurization of various boiling point fractions present in the crude oil feed, including naphtha fractions, middle distillate fractions, vacuum gas oil fractions and/or residuum fractions. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Desulfurization Unit Catalyst </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Catalysts for use in the crude desulfurization unit <highlight><bold>04</bold></highlight> are generally composed of a hydrogenation component, selected from Group VIb (preferably molybdenum and/or tungsten, more preferably molybdenum) and Group VIII (preferably cobalt and/or nickel) of the Periodic Table, or a mixture thereof, all supported on an alumina support. Phosphorous (Group Va) oxide is optionally present as an active ingredient. A typical desulfurization catalyst contains from 3 to 35 wt % hydrogenation components, with an alumina binder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The catalyst pellets range in size from {fraction (1/32)} inch to &frac18; inch. A spherical, extruded, trilobate or quadrilobate shape is preferred. In general, the crude oil feed passing through the desulfurization unit contacts first a catalyst preselected for metals removal, though some sulfur, nitrogen and aromatic removal will also occur. Subsequent catalyst layers are preselected for sulfur and nitrogen removal, though they would also be expected to catalyze the removal of metals and/or cracking reactions. </paragraph>

Catalyst layer(s) preselected for denitrification/desulfurization comprise catalyst(s) having an average pore size ranging from 100 to 190 &angst; with a pore volume of 0.5-1.1 cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>/g. U.S. Pat. No. 4,90,243 describes a hydrotreating catalyst having a pore size of at least about 60 &angst;, and preferably from about 75 &angst; to about 120 &angst;. A demetallation catalyst useful for the present process is described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,976,848, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes. Likewise, catalysts useful for desulfurization of heavy streams are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,215,955 and 5,177,047, the entire disclosures of which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.

For the present invention, conversion is generally related to a reference temperature, such as, for example, the minimum boiling point temperature of the hydrocracker feedstock. The extent of conversion relates to the percentage of feed boiling above the reference temperature which is converted during hydrocracking into hydrocrackate boiling below the reference temperature.

As described above with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, desulfurized crude oil <highlight><bold>06</bold></highlight> is treated in one or more flash zones <highlight><bold>08</bold></highlight> to remove unreacted hydrogen and light hydrocarbon products <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The desulfurized liquid <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from the flash zone(s) <highlight><bold>08</bold></highlight> is then passed to a crude fractionator <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>.

In a preferred embodiment of the process, the desulfurized liquid <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is fractionated in fractionation zone <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which comprises at least one distillation column (not shown) which is operated substantially at or slightly above atmospheric pressure (i.e. an atmospheric distillation column) and at least one distillation column (not shown) which is operated at sub-atmospheric pressure (i.e. a vacuum distillation column). Such distillation columns are well known in the art. Desulfurized liquid <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is passed to the atmospheric distillation column to produce at least naphtha stream <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and an atmospheric residuum, which is further fractionated in the vacuum distillation column. A vacuum gas oil <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is isolated as a distillate fraction from the vacuum distillation column, and vacuum residuum stream <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is isolated as a bottoms fraction from the vacuum distillation column. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The vacuum gas oil <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is passed directly to hydrocracker unit hydrocracking unit <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> for conversion to lower molecular weight products and for reduction in sulfur, nitrogen and/or aromatic content. As shown in the preferred embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the hydroconversion step involves at least two reaction vessels, first hydrocracker stage <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and second hydrocracker stage <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The hydrocracking process is especially useful in the production of middle distillate fractions boiling in the range of about 250&deg;-700&deg; F. (121&deg;-371&deg; C.) as determine by the appropriate ASTM test procedure. The hydrocracking process involves conversion of a petroleum feedstock by, for example, molecular weight reduction via cracking, hydrogenation of olefins and aromatics, and removal of nitrogen, sulfur and other heteroatoms. The process may be controlled to a certain cracking conversion or to a desired product sulfur level or nitrogen level or both. Conversion is generally related to a reference temperature, such as, for example, the minimum boiling point temperature of the hydrocracker feedstock. The extent of conversion relates to the percentage of feed boiling above the reference temperature which is converted during hydrocracking into hydrocrackate boiling below the reference temperature. </paragraph>

Hydrogen isolated from effluent <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> contains H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>S and NH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. In conventional processes, such hydrogen is purified prior to use as recycle to the first hydrocracking stage or as H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>feed to the second hydrocracking stage.

The use of hydrogen in this way is facilitated by passing effluent <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> to hot hydrogen stripper <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for removing light gases contained therein, including hydrogen and light hydrocarbon gases, using heated hydrogen <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Typically, hot hydrogen stripper <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is operated at temperatures preferably between 260&deg; C. and 399&deg; C. (500&deg; F. and 750&deg; F.).

<heading lvl="1">2nd Stage Catalyst </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The catalyst used in the second hydrocracking stage <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is a conventional hydrocracking catalyst of the type used to carry out hydroconversion reactions to produce transportation fuels. First hydrocracker stage <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and second hydrocracker stage <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> can contain one or more catalyst in more than one reaction zone. If more than one distinct catalyst is present in either or the reaction zones, they may either be blended or be present as distinct layers. Layered catalyst systems are taught, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,990,243. Hydrocracking catalyst useful for second hydrocracker stage <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are well known. In general, the hydrocracking catalyst comprises a cracking component and a hydrogenation component on an oxide support material or binder. The cracking component may include an amorphous cracking component and/or a zeolite, such as a y-type zeolite, and ultrastable Y type zeolite, or a dealuminated zeolite. Particularly preferred catalytic cracking catalysts are those containing at least one zeolite which is normally mixed with a suitable matrix such as alumina, silica or silica-alumina. A suitable amorphous cracking component is silica-alumina. The preferred amorphous cracking component is between 10 and 90 weight percent silica, preferably between 15 and 65 weight percent silica, the remainder being alumina. A cracking component containing in the range from about 10% to about 80% by weight of the Y-type zeolite and from about 90% to about 20% by weight of the amorphous cracking component is preferred. Still more preferred is a cracking component containing in the range from about 15% by weight to about 50% by weight of the Y-type zeolite, the remainder being the amorphous cracking component. Also, so-called x-ray amorphous zeolites (i.e., zeolites having crystallite sizes too small to be detected by standard x-ray techniques) can be suitably applied as cracking components. Hydrogenation components suitable for the hydrocracking and/or hydrotreating catalysts which are used in the present integrated process include those which are comprised of at least one Group VIII (IUPAC Notation) metal, preferably iron, cobalt and nickel, more preferably cobalt and/or nickel and at least one Group VI (IUPAC Notation) metal, preferably molybdenum and tungsten, on a high surface area support material, preferably alumina. Other suitable catalysts include zeolitic catalysts, as well as noble metal catalysts where the noble metal is selected from palladium and platinum. It is within the scope of the present invention that more than one type of catalyst be used in the same reaction vessel. The Group VIII metal is typically present in an amount ranging from about 2 to about 20 weight percent. The Group VI metal will typically be present in an amount ranging from about 1 to about 25 weight percent. The hydrogenation components in the catalyst may be in the oxidic and/or the sulfidic form. If a combination of at least a Group VI and a Group VIII metal component is present as (mixed) oxides, it will be subjected a sulfiding treatment prior to proper use in hydrotreating or hydrocracking. Suitably, the catalyst comprises one or more components of nickel an/or cobalt and one or more components of molybdenum and/or tungsten or one or more components of platinum and/or palladium. Catalysts containing nickel and molybdenum, nickel and tungsten, platinum and/or palladium are particularly preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The effective diameter of the zeolite catalyst particles are in the range of from about {fraction (1/32)} inch to about &frac14; inch, preferably from about {fraction (1/20)} inch to about &frac18; inch. The catalyst particles may have any shape known to be useful for catalytic materials, including spheres, cylinders, fluted cylinders, prills, granules and the like. For non-spherical shapes, the effective diameter can be taken as the diameter of a representative cross section of the catalyst particles. The catalyst particles will further have a surface area in the range of from about 50 to about 500 m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/g. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Layered Hydrocracking Zone for Light Gas Oil Hydrotreating </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> light gas oil stream <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> isolated from the desulfurized liquid <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is hydrotreated in <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> to remove sulfur and/or aromatics in preparation of a low sulfur, low aromatic fuel product <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. In a separate preferred embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the hydrotreating catalyst useful for hydrotreating light gas oil stream <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is layered at or near the bottom of second hydrocracker stage <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Thus, second hydrocracker stage <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> includes a layered catalyst system, with catalysts typically used for hydrocracking near the feed inlet to second hydrocracker stage <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and one or more layers of catalyst typically used for hydrotreating near the product effluent outlet of second hydrocracker stage <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The amount of hydrotreating catalyst in second hydrocracker stage <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is generally smaller than the amount of hydrocracking catalyst included in second hydrocracker stage <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. In including the hydrotreating catalyst as a layer in an otherwise hydrocracking reaction mode, it is expected that the effluent from the catalyst layers for hydrocracking, having reacted at hydrocracking conditions in second hydrocracker stage <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, would not be modified to any significant extent in the layer of hydrotreating catalyst in second hydrocracker stage <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. However, the unreacted hydrogen in the reacting stream passing from the bed(s) of hydrocracking catalyst are available for further reaction without additional heating, pressurization and/or purification. Thus, light gas oil stream <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> stream, which is essentially fuel boiling range material, but with higher amounts of sulfur, nitrogen and/or aromatics than is permitted for current fuels, is passed to the portion of second hydrocracker stage <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> which contains the layer(s) of hydrotreating catalyst. Bypassing the hydrocracking catalyst beds reduces the amount of undesirable cracking of light gas oil <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> stream. Furthermore, reaction of light gas oil stream <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in combination with the effluent from the layers of hydrocracking catalyst of second hydrocracker stage <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> serves to remove additional contaminants from light gas oil stream <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> without molecular weight reduction and without added hydrogen beyond that potentially required to quench exothermic heat release from the layers of hydrotreating catalyst in second hydrocracker stage <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The reaction conditions for hydrotreating the naphtha stream in the second hydrocracker stage is expected to be the same as reaction conditions for hydrocracking in that stage. The blend of fuels produced in the various catalyst layers of second hydrocracker stage <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is separated in product fractionator <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. At least one fuel stream, shown as <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, is isolated from product fractionator <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
