<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to portable electronic devices and, more particularly, to compact input/output systems, such as displays and keyboards, for use with portable electronic devices. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Mobile communication devices generally have a data input device such as a keyboard, for inputting data to the mobile device&apos;s controller, and a data output device such as a display, for communicating data from the controller to the mobile device&apos;s user. Both the data input device and data output device are typically a fixed, integral part of the mobile communication device. For example, in a conventional mobile cellular telephone, the keypad is fixed in one location on the case of the cellular telephone, as is the display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Due to the small size of most mobile communication devices, integral data input and output devices are generally small and difficult to use. For example, the typical cellular telephone keypad and display are constrained by the size of the cellular telephone. As future cellular telephones continue to get smaller, so too must their integral keypads and displays. As the keypads become ever smaller, they become more difficult to manipulate. As the displays become ever smaller, they become more difficult to read. Thus, it would be advantageous to have a keypad and display that are not constrained by the size of the portable electronic device to which they are attached. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a conventional cellular mobile telephone <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Cell phone <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> has a display <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, which is typically used to show information to the user, such as dialed phone numbers. Cell phone <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> also has a keypad <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> with a plurality of keys <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. The keys <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> are generally small and difficult to manipulate, especially if cell phone <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is small. Using the display <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to show complex graphics or lengthy strings of text can be difficult, due to the limitations on the size of the display that are necessarily imposed by the form of the cellular telephone <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Thus, it would be advantageous to create an input device and an output device for a portable electronic device that are not strictly limited by the size of the portable electronic device with which they are used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Past efforts to create an input device that is not limited by the size of the portable electronic device which contains it have resulted in inventions such as the voice-activated cellular telephone. Voice-activated dialing solutions suffer from the disadvantage that voice recognition software is imperfect. Voice control systems also require considerable processing power and memory storage, both of which are typically in short supply in a portable device. Thus, it would be an advantage to create a reliable input device that allows ease of use but does not require excessive processor and memory resources from the portable electronic device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Past efforts to create an output device that is not limited by the size of the portable electronic device that contains it have resulted in inventions such as the &ldquo;virtual display.&rdquo; Virtual display systems generally function in one of two ways both of which require the user to wear special glasses, either that have lenses which are used as miniature displays that are easy to read due to their proximity to the eye or that have lasers that &ldquo;paint&rdquo; an image onto the retina of the eye, thereby creating the illusion of a large display hanging in space in front of the user. Virtual display systems have the disadvantage that they require the user to wear, and keep track of, glasses. Thus it would be an advantage to create a display system that is not strictly limited by the size of the portable device that contains it, yet does not require that the user wear, or keep track of, extra components. </paragraph>

In the embodiment shown, output device <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> is a display and input device <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is a key. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> depicts a block diagram of a mobile station <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> that can make use of the disclosed embodiments. Although the invention is discussed in the context of a mobile station for exemplary purposes, any suitable electronic device, such as a portable computer or personal digital assistant (PDA), may implement the innovative data input/output device disclosed herein. The mobile station <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> includes, in this example: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> An input/output device <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> containing an audio interface, i.e. a speaker <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> and microphone <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>. The input/output device <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> generally includes at least one display assembly <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> allowing a user to see dialed digits, stored information, messages, calling status information, including signal strength, etc. The input/output device <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> generally includes at least one keypad <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, or other user control device, allowing a user to dial numbers, answer incoming calls, enter stored information, and perform other mobile station functions. In the context of the preferred embodiment of the disclosed invention, input/output device <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is a &ldquo;hide-away&rdquo; unit that may be folded and disposed within the mobile station <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. The input/output device <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> also has a controller unit <highlight><bold>434</bold></highlight> that interfaces with a logic control assembly <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> responsible, from the control unit perspective, for receiving data and commands from the keypad <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> or other control devices, such as the disclosed invention, and providing status information, alerts, data, and other information to the display assembly <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> A transceiver unit <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> includes a transmitter unit <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>, receiver unit <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight>, and the logic control assembly <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight>. The transmitter unit <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> converts low-level audio signals from the microphone <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> to digital coding using a codec (a data coder/decoder) <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>. The digitally encoded audio is represented by modulated shifts, for example, in the frequency domain, using a shift key modulator/demodulator <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>. Other data received from the logic control assembly <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight>, such as station parameters and control information, may also be encoded for transmission. The modulated signal is then amplified by RF amplifier <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight> and transmitted via an antenna assembly <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight>; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The antenna assembly <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight> contains a TR (transmitter/receiver) switch <highlight><bold>436</bold></highlight> to prevent simultaneous reception and transmission of a signal by the mobile station <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. The transceiver unit <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> is connected to the antenna assembly <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight> through the TR switch <highlight><bold>436</bold></highlight>. The antenna assembly contains at least one antenna <highlight><bold>438</bold></highlight> coupled to TR switch <highlight><bold>436</bold></highlight> by coupler <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> A receiver unit <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> receives a transmitted signal via the antenna assembly <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight>. The signal is amplified by receiver/amplifier <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight> and demodulated by shift-key demodulator <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>. If the signal is an audio signal, it is decoded using the codec <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>. The audio signal is then reproduced by the speaker <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. Other signals, such as remote data input from the present invention are handled by the logic control assembly <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> after demodulation by demodulator <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> A logic control assembly <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> usually containing an application specific integrated circuit (or ASIC) combining many functions, such as a general purpose microprocessor, digital signal processor, and other functions, into one integrated circuit. The logic control assembly <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> coordinates the overall operation of the transmitter and receiver using control messages. The various disclosed embodiments would make use of the logic control assembly <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> to update the display <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> and accept input from the keypad <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. Generally, the logic control assembly <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> operates from a program that is stored in flash memory <highlight><bold>428</bold></highlight> of the mobile station. Flash memory <highlight><bold>428</bold></highlight> allows upgrading of operating software, software correction or addition of new features. Flash memory <highlight><bold>428</bold></highlight> is also used to hold user information such as speed dialing names and stored numbers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In addition to flash memory <highlight><bold>428</bold></highlight>, the mobile station <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> will typically contain read only memory (ROM) <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> for storing information that should not change, such as startup procedures, and random access memory (RAM) <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight> to hold temporary information such as channel number and system identifier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As will be recognized by those skilled in the art, the innovative concepts described in the present application can be modified and varied over a tremendous range of applications, and accordingly the scope of patented subject matter is not limited by any of the specific exemplary teachings given. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> For example, although the various embodiments have generally been discussed in the context of keypads or keyboards, one skilled in the art understands that the invention is equally applicable to keypads and keyboards. Therefore, for purposes of this application, the terms keypad and keyboard are considered synonymous. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> For example, although the invention has primarily been discussed in the context of a portable device with a foldable keyboard and display, one skilled in the art understands that the disclosed innovation could be used with either an input device or an output device, rather than requiring both an input device and output device. For example, a foldable hide-away display could be implemented in a portable device with a traditional keyboard, or vice-versa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Although the input and output devices have primarily been discussed in the context of keyboards and displays, one skilled in the art understands that the invention is equally applicable to a variety of input and output devices such as, for example, speakers and touchpads. </paragraph>
