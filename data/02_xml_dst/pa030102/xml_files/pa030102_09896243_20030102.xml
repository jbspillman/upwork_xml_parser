<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to a quick connect/disconnect coupling and more specifically, to a quick connect/disconnect hydraulic or pneumatic hose coupling that utilizes a diametrically expandable locking ring (such as a split ring) within the female coupling member to maintain a locking arrangement between the male and female coupling members, and a release mechanism designed for simple and efficient decoupling of the male and female members that does not require the use of proprietary tools. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A first aspect of the present invention is directed to a coupling assembly that includes: a) a female coupling member including a cavity opening onto its receiving end, where the cavity has an annular groove; b) a male coupling member including an annular rib, where the rib has a tapered leading edge, a trailing edge and a maximum diameter between the leading and trailing edges; c) a diametrically expandable locking ring carried in the annular groove of the female coupling member, where the locking ring has an un-expanded inner diameter that is less than the maximum diameter of the annular rib on the male coupling member, and where the locking ring is diametrically expandable to have an inner diameter that is at least slightly larger than the maximum diameter of the annular rib; and d) a cam surface extending radially outwardly from the male coupling member and positioned axially between the trailing edge of the rib and trailing end of the male coupling member, where the cam surface has a radial height substantially equal to or greater than the radial height of the annular rib on the male coupling member at the maximum diameter of the annular rib. The male coupling member is dimensioned for insertion into the cavity of the female coupling member to a locking position in which the trailing edge of the annular rib passes the receiving-side edge of the annular groove in the female coupling member. Whereupon insertion of the male coupling member into the cavity of the female coupling member to the locking position, the tapered leading edge of the annular rib on the male coupling member contacts the inner surface of the locking ring, causing the locking ring to diametrically expand as the locking ring advances towards the trailing edge of the annular rib and upon passing the trailing edge of the annular rib, the locking ring contracts again and is maintained in a locking state between the trailing edge of the annular rib and the receiving side edge of the annular groove. The male coupling member is further dimensioned for selective axial movement inwardly towards the distal end of the female coupling member, from the locking position to an unlocking position. With such movement of the male coupling member to the unlocking position the cam surface passes the receiving side edge of the annular groove. Whereupon movement of the male coupling member from the locking position to the unlocking position, the cam surface extending radially outwardly from the male coupling member contacts the locking ring and diametrically expands the locking ring again so that the annular rib of the male coupling member may pass back again by the locking ring during removal of the male coupling member from the female coupling member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In a more detailed embodiment, the coupling further includes an annular collar carried on the male coupling member, where the annular collar includes the cam surface. In a further detailed embodiment, the annular collar is axially slidable along the male coupling member. In yet a further detailed embodiment, the coupling assembly further includes a first retainer that retains the cam surface of the annular collar and axial alignment with the annular groove of the female coupling member as the male coupling member is being removed from the female coupling member, at least until the trailing edge of the rib on the male coupling member passes back beyond the receiving-side edge of the annular groove in the cavity of the female coupling member. In yet a further detailed embodiment, the cam surface of the annular collar includes a leading edge for contacting the locking ring and an axially extending portion for maintaining the locking ring in the diametrically expanded state, and the first retainer is the locking ring contracting against the axially extending portion of the cam surface of the annular collar, thereby frictionally or mechanically retaining the annular collar in axial position as the male coupling member is being removed from the female coupling member, until the annular rib of the male coupling member contacts the annular collar and carries the annular collar out with the male coupling member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In yet a further detailed embodiment, the collar is slidable on the male coupling member from an unlocked position, in which the collar is positioned axially against the annular rib providing a relatively smooth circumferential transition surface from the trailing edge of the annular rib to the axially extending portion of the cam surface of the annular collar, to a locked position, in which the collar is axially spaced from the annular rib to provide an annular gap axially between the collar and the annular rib, into which the locking ring can (at least partially) diametrically contract into the locking state between the trailing edge and the receiving side edge of the annular groove. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In yet a further detailed embodiment, the coupling assembly further includes a releaseable second retainer for selectively retaining the collar in the locked position. In yet a further detailed embodiment, this releaseable, second retainer is a clip removably coupled to either the male coupling member or the collar, and is adapted to contact the receiving edge of the female coupling member so as to prohibit the male coupling member from being selectively moved axially to the unlocking position within the female coupling member. In an even further detailed embodiment, the collar includes a first radially outwardly extending flange positioned axially distal from the leading edge of the cam surface on the collar, the male coupling member includes a second radially outwardly extending flange positioned on a trailing edge side of the collar, the clip is removably coupled to the collar on a leading edge side of the first radially outwardly extending flange, and the clip is adapted to be maintained between the receiving end of the female coupling member and the first radially outwardly extending flange of the collar and the second radially outwardly extending flange is adapted to contact the trailing edge side of the collar, thereby preventing the collar from sliding axially beyond the second radially outwardly extending flange. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is a second aspect of the present invention to provide a coupling assembly that includes: a) a female coupling member including a cavity opening onto its receiving end, where the cavity has an annular groove; b) a male coupling member including annular rib, the rib having a tapered leading edge, a trailing edge and a maximum diameter between the leading and trailing edges; c) a diametrically expandable locking ring carried in the annular groove of the female coupling member, where the locking ring has an un-expanded inner diameter that is less than the maximum diameter of the annular rib on the male coupling member, and the locking ring is diametrically expandable to have an inner diameter that is at least slightly larger than the maximum diameter of the annular rib on the male coupling member; and d) an annular collar slidably carried on the male coupling member axially between the trailing edge of the annular rib and the trailing end of the male coupling member, where the annular collar includes an outer circumferential surface having an outer diameter substantially equal to or greater than the maximum diameter of the annular rib and where the annular collar is slidable on the male coupling member from an unlocked position, in which the collar is positioned axially against the annular rib providing a relatively smooth circumferential surface from the trailing edge of the annular rib to the axially extending portion of the cam surface of the annular collar to a locked position, in which the collar is axially spaced from the annular rib to provide an annular gap axially between the collar and the annular rib, where the annular gap is dimensioned for receiving at least a portion of at least a partially contracted locking ring therein. The male coupling member is dimensioned for insertion into the cavity of the female coupling member to a locking position in which the trailing edge of the annular rib passes the receiving side edge of the annular groove in the female coupling member. Whereupon insertion of the male coupling member into the cavity of the female coupling member to a locking position, the tapered leading edge of the annular rib on the male coupling member contacts the inner surface of the locking ring, causing the locking ring to diametrically expand as the locking ring advances toward the trailing edge of the annular rib, and upon passing the trailing edge of the annular rib to the annular gap axially between the collar in the annular rib, the locking ring contracts again and is maintained in a locking state between the trailing edge of the annular rib and the receiving side edge of the annular groove. The male coupling member is further dimensioned for selective axial movement inwardly in towards the distal end of the female coupling member, from the locking position to an unlocking position. In the unlocking position, the outer circumferential surface of the annular collar is moved into axial alignment with the annular groove in the female coupling member. Therefore, upon movement of the male coupling member from the locking position to the unlocking position, the annular collar contacts the locking ring and diametrically expands the locking ring again so that the annular rib of the male coupling member may pass back again by the locking ring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In a further detailed embodiment of the second aspect of the present invention, the coupling assembly further includes a stop positionable to a blocking position inhibiting the male coupling member from moving from the locking position to the unlocking position. In yet a further detailed embodiment, the stop is positionable to the blocking position axially between the receiving end of the female coupling member and a projection extending radially outwardly from either the male coupling member or the collar. In yet a further detailed embodiment, the projection is an annular flange. In yet a further detailed embodiment, the stop is a removable clip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In an alternate detailed embodiment of the second aspect of the present invention the stop is positionable to the blocking position axially between the receiving end of the female coupling member and an annular flange extending radially outwardly from the collar. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In yet another alternate detailed embodiment of the second aspect of the present invention, the coupling assembly further includes a retainer for retaining the annular collar in axial alignment with the annular groove in the female coupling member as the male coupling member is being removed from the female coupling member at least until the trailing edge of the rib on the male coupling member passes the receiving side edge of the annular groove in the cavity of the female coupling member. In yet a further detailed embodiment, the retainer is the locking ring contracting against the outer circumferential surface of the collar. In yet a further detailed embodiment, the coupling assembly further includes a stop positionable to a blocking position inhibiting the male coupling member from moving from the locking position to the unlocking position. In yet a further detailed embodiment, the stop is positionable to the blocking position axially between the receiving end of the female coupling member and projection extending radially outwardly from either the male coupling member or the collar. In yet a further detailed embodiment, the projection is an annular flange. In yet an even further detailed embodiment, the stop is a removable clip, such as a C clip. In yet an even further detailed embodiment, the annular flange extends radially outwardly from the collar. In yet an even further detailed embodiment, the male coupling member includes an abutment extending radially outwardly therefrom to limit movement of the collar towards the trailing end of the male coupling member. In yet an even further detailed embodiment, this abutment is an annular flange extending radially outwardly from the male coupling member. In yet an even further detailed embodiment, the annular rib on the male coupling member includes a shoulder at the trailing edge of the annular rib, where the shoulder is substantially normal to an axis of the male coupling member. In yet a further detailed embodiment, the locking ring is an annular split ring, where the split ring comprises a length of spring material formed into a ring, where the length of spring material includes a cross-sectional radius. In yet a further detailed embodiment, the leading end of the annular collar has a radial height that is less than the cross-sectional radius of the length of spring material comprising the annular split ring; therefore, as the male coupling member is moved inwardly to the unlocking position, the leading end of the annular collar contacts the annular split ring lifting the annular split ring radially outwardly substantially into the annular groove in the male coupling member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In another alternate embodiment of the second aspect of the present invention, the male and female coupling members include fluid channels extending axially completely therethrough. In yet a further detailed embodiment, the male and female coupling members are hydraulic coupling members and the fluid channels are, therefore, hydraulic fluid channels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In yet a further alternate detailed embodiment of the second aspect of the present invention, the male coupling member includes a first stop positioned on a trailing edge side of the annular collar and the first stop retains the annular collar in axial position with respect to the male coupling member as the male coupling member is being inserted into the locking position. In a further detailed embodiment, this first stop is a projection extending radially outwardly from the male coupling member. In yet a further detailed embodiment, this projection is an annular flange. In yet an even further detailed embodiment, the coupling assembly further includes a retainer for retaining the annular collar in axial alignment with the annular groove in the female coupling member as the male coupling member is being removed from the female coupling member, at least until the trailing edge of the rib passes the receiving side edge of the annular groove in the cavity of the female coupling member. In yet a further detailed embodiment, the coupling assembly further includes a second stop positionable to a blocking position inhibiting the male coupling member from moving from the locking position to the unlocking position. In yet a further detailed embodiment, the second stop is positionable to the blocking position axially between the receiving end of the female coupling member and a projection extending radially outwardly from either the male coupling member or the collar. In yet a further detailed embodiment, this projection is an annular flange extending radially outwardly from the collar. In yet a further detailed embodiment, the second stop is a removable clip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In yet another alternate detailed embodiment of the second aspect of the present invention, the annular rib on the male coupling member includes a shoulder at the trailing edge of the annular rib, where the shoulder is substantially normal to an axis of the male coupling member. In yet a further detailed embodiment, the locking ring is an annular split ring, which comprises a length of spring material formed into a ring, where the length of spring material has a cross-sectional radius. In yet a further detailed embodiment, the leading end of the annular collar has a radial height that is less than the cross-sectional radius of the length of spring material comprising the annular split ring; therefore, as the male coupling member is moved inwardly to the unlocking position, the leading end of the annular collar contacts the split ring, lifting the annular split ring radially outwardly substantially into the annular groove in the female coupling member.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, an exemplary embodiment of a quick connect/disconnect mechanism according to the present invention is a hydraulic hose fitting assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> designed and dimensioned to meet the SAE J517-Series 100R12 pressure standard, The assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes a male coupling member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> adapted for fitting a hydraulic hose (not shown) thereon and a female coupling member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> adapted to be attached to a hydraulic fluid source, receptacle or passage. The male coupling member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> includes a generally cylindrical body <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> having a cylindrical conduit or passage <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> extending completely therethrough along a central axis <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the male coupling member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Mounted to the trailing end <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the generally cylindrical body may be a ferrule (not shown) of conventional design which would be adapted to attached a hydraulic hose (not shown) to the trailing end <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the cylindrical body <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The female coupling member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> also includes a conduit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> extending completely therethrough along a central axis <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> thereof for providing passage of the hydraulic fluid therethrough. The distal end <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the female coupling member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is threaded for mounting the female coupling member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to a hydraulic fluid source, receptacle or passage as know to those of ordinary skill in the art. Between the receiving end <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and a distal end <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the female coupling member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is provided a plurality of circumferentially distributed flats <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> that define a hexagonal cross-section for engagement by an appropriate tool such as a wrench, to install the female coupling member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to the appropriate hydraulic fluid receptacle, source or passage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The generally cylindrical body <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the male coupling member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> includes a tapered leading edge <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> immediately trailed by a cylindrical surface <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> that includes a circumferential groove <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> provided therein for receiving appropriate seals, such as an O-ring seal and/or a back-up washer (not shown). The cylindrical surface <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is trailed by an annular rib <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> that includes a ramped leading edge <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, immediately trailed by a substantially cylindrical surface <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> at its maximum diameter and a trailing edge shoulder <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> that is substantially normal to the axis <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and substantially perpendicular to the surface <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The ramped leading edge <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, in this exemplary embodiment, is angled with respect to the axis at a 15&deg; angle. It would be apparent that alternate angles are possible for this ramped leading edge <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, however, it is preferred, but not required, that the ramped leading edge <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> be angled with respect to the axis <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> at an angle ranging from 8&deg; to 20&deg;. Trailing the annular rib <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is a substantially cylindrical surface <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> for slidably receiving an annular collar <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> thereon. The purpose and operation of this annular collar <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> will be described in further detail below. Trailing the circumferential surface <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is an annular flange <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> extending radially outwardly from the generally cylindrical body <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the male coupling member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The collar <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is axially captured on the cylindrical surface <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> by and between the shoulder <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of the annular rib <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the flange <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The trailing end of the collar <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> includes a flange <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> extending radially outwardly therefrom. A removable C clip <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is clipped onto the collar <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> so as to circumscribe an outer circumferential surface of the collar adjacent to the flange <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The female coupling member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> includes a receiving cavity <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> extending into the receiving end <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and coaxial with the center axis <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. This cavity <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is sized and dimensioned for receiving and securing the leading end of the male coupling member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> therein. As will be described in detail below, the axial length of the cavity <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> also allows for axial movement of the male coupling member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> from a locked position to an unlocking position within the cavity. Nevertheless, the cavity <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> includes an end shoulder <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> facing the male coupling member within the cavity <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. An outwardly angled conical surface <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> extends from the end shoulder <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> to match the tapered leading edge <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the male coupling member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. A substantially flat cylindrical surface <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> extends from the conical surface <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> to receive the cylindrical surface <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of the male coupling member, where the seals carried in the annular groove <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are adapted to provide a substantially fluid-tight seal between the leading end of the male coupling member and the inner surface of the cavity <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> in the female coupling member. From this substantially flat surface <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> an outwardly angled conical surface <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> extends therefrom to substantially match the ramped leading edge <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> (15&deg; angle) of the annular rib <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> on the male coupling member. This conical surface <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> thereafter extends to a cylindrical surface <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> adapted to match the circumferentially flat outer surface <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> at the maximum diameter of the annular rib <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the male coupling member. It is noted that this cylindrical surface <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> has an axial width that is longer than the circumferentially flat outer surface <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> at the maximum diameter of the annular rib <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the male coupling member, which allows the male coupling member to be moved axially from the locking position to the unlocking position within the cavity <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> as will be described in further detail below. The remainder of the cavity <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> extending from the cylindrical surface <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> to the receiving end <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the female coupling member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is particularly adapted to provide the locking engagement with the male coupling member. <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The locking elements providing in the receiving cavity <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the female coupling member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> essentially include an annular groove <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> having a tapered receiving side edge <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> (having a taper angle of 45&deg; with respect to the axis <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> in this exemplary embodiment). The distal-side edge <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> of the annular groove <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> in this embodiment is not tapered, but provides a substantially normal surface (for example, certain embodiments have an approximate 1-2&deg; relief angle as a manufacturing expedient). The tapered receiving side edge <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> of the annular groove <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> extends to a substantially flat cylindrical surface <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, which in turn, extends to a substantially outwardly angled conical surface <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> (which is angled at a 45&deg; angle with respect to the axis <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> in this exemplary embodiment). The combination of surfaces <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> discussed above essentially provide an inwardly extending flange <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> approximate the receiving end <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the female coupling member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The female coupling member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> also carries a diametrically expandable ring <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> within the annular groove <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> in the receiving cavity <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. The ring <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> is expandable from an unexpanded inner diameter that is less than the maximum diameter <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the annular rib <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> on the male coupling member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, to an expanded inner diameter that is at least slightly larger than the maximum diameter <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the annular rib on the male coupling <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. In the exemplary embodiment, the diametrically expandable ring <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> is a split ring of spring steel that includes a cut <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> extending therethrough which allows the two ends formed by the cut to separate from one another when sufficient pressure is provided on the inner surface of the ring <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, thereby diametrically expanding the ring <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>to couple the male coupling member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to the female coupling member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the leading end <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the male coupling member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is inserted into the receiving end cavity <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the female coupling member such that the ramped leading edge <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the annular rib <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> on the male coupling member contacts the inner surface of the diametrically expandable ring <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> and causes the diametrically expandable ring <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> to diametrically expand as the ramped section <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the rib <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> passes through the diametrically expandable ring <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>. During this expansion, the ring <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> will be maintained in axial position within the female coupling member by the annular groove <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. As the trailing edge <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of the annular rib <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> passes past the ring <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, the ring will contract again to be maintained in a locking position (as shown best in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) between the trailing edge <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of the annular rib and the receiving side edge <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> of the annular groove in the female coupling member. An annular gap <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> provided axially between the leading edge <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> of the collar <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and the trailing edge shoulder <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of the annular rib <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> guarantees that the ring <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> will be sandwiched between the trailing edge <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of the rib <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> on the male coupling member and the receiving side edge <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> of the annular groove <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> in the female coupling member if one were to attempt to pull the male coupling member <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> out from the female coupling member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> after the male coupling member has been inserted and locked into the female coupling member as shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Because the C clip <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is coupled around the collar <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, it is positioned axially between the flange <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of the collar <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and the receiving end <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the female coupling member, thereby prohibiting the male coupling member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> from any further axial movement into the cavity <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the female coupling member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Removal of the male coupling member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> from the female coupling member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is, generally, a three step process, the first two steps of which are shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 4</cross-reference>a and the third step of which is shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the first step of the removal process is to remove the C clip <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> from the male coupling member. A second step is to push the male coupling member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> axially inwardly (as shown by arrow A) into the cavity <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the female coupling member such that the leading end <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> of the collar <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> contacts the split ring <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> and slides axially underneath the split ring <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, thereby diametrically expanding the split ring <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> such that the split ring <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> has an inner circumferential diameter that is substantially equal to, or slightly greater than the outer circumferential diameter of the leading end of the collar, and such that split ring <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> is received substantially entirely within the annular groove <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. This inner axial movement will continue until the ramp <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> contacts the inner conical surface <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of the cavity <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> in the female coupling member. Alternatively, such inner axial movement may be stopped, for example, by the flange <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> on the collar contacting the receiving end <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the female coupling member, or by the leading end <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the male coupling member contacting the end shoulder <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> within the cavity <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>the last step of the decoupling process is to pull the male coupling member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> out again from within the cavity <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the female coupling member (the direction of which is shown by arrow B). As the male coupling member is being removed from the female coupling member, the compressive and frictional forces of the ring <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> against the outer cylindrical surface of the collar <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> retains the leading edge <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> of the collar in axial alignment with the ring <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> and groove <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, which in turn causes the outer circumferential surface <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the male coupling member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to slide axially in the direction shown by arrow B with respect to the collar <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> until the shoulder <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of the annular rib <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> contacts the leading edge <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> of the collar, thereby carrying the collar <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> out with the male coupling member as the male coupling member is being removed from within the cavity <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the female coupling member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. When the shoulder <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of the rib <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> contacts the leading edge <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> of the collar <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, the annular gap <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> between the leading edge <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and the shoulder <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is eliminated, thereby providing a substantially smooth transition from the maximum diameter <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of the rib <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to the outer circumferential surface of the collar. Therefore, as the shoulder <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> carries the collar <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> out with the male coupling member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, this substantially smooth transition between the leading edge <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and the shoulder <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of the rib retains the ring <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> within the cavity <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> (where the ring <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> has a inner diameter that is substantially the same as, or slightly greater than the maximum diameter <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the rib <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>), thereby allowing the rib <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to pass by the locking ring <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> in the direction shown by arrow B, resulting in a decoupled assembly as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. It will be understood that the &ldquo;substantially smooth transition&rdquo; discussed above does not require identical outer diameters between the annular rib <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> on the male coupling member and the leading edge <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> of the collar (as will be seen below with respect to alternate embodiment of the collar <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>&prime;). Essentially, for the purposes of this invention, &ldquo;substantially smooth transition&rdquo; requires that the differences in outer diameters between the annular rib <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the leading edge <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> of the collar <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> not be such that the ring <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> gets caught against a portion of the shoulder <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> rising above the collar <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> as the male coupling member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is being removed from the female coupling member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, during this last step of the decoupling process, to the extent that it will not allow the male coupling member from being removed from the female coupling member without using undue force. Likewise, this same criteria applies when it is described that the outer circumferential surface at the leading end of the collar has an outer diameter that is substantially equal to or greater than the maximum diameter of the annular rib. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> While in the exemplary embodiment, the ring <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> applies compressive and frictional forces on the collar <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> to retain the leading end of the collar in axial alignment with the ring <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> and groove <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> as the male coupling member is being removed from the female coupling member (at least until the trailing edge of the rib passes the receiving-edge side of the annular groove in the cavity of the female coupling member), it is within the scope of the present invention that the ring <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> mechanically retain the collar in axial alignment with the ring <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> and groove <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> as the male coupling member is being removed from the female coupling member. For example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</cross-reference>, an alternative embodiment of the annular collar <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>&prime; could be provided that includes an arcuate-shaped annular groove <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> approximate the leading end <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>&prime; of the collar. This arcuate annular groove <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is adapted to seat the ring <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> therein, thereby creating a mechanical coupling between the ring <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> and the collar <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>&prime;. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>A, during the second step of the decoupling process, in which the male coupling member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is pushed axially inwardly (as shown by arrow A) into the cavity <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the female coupling member such that the leading end <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>&prime; of the collar <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>&prime; contacts the split ring <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> and slides axailly underneath the split ring <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> to diametrically expand the split ring <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, the split ring will settle into the annular groove <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, and thus be retained within the annular groove <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. Then, during the last step of the decoupling process, in which the male coupling member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is pulled out again from within the cavity <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the female coupling member (as shown by arrow B), the collar <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>&prime; will move with the male coupling member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> until the split ring <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> contacts the tapered receiving side edge <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> of the annular groove <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. The leading end <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>&prime; of the collar <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>&prime; will then be retained in axial alignment with the annular groove <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> as the male coupling member is slid axially in the direction of arrow B, until the trailing edge shoulder <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of the annular rib <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> contacts the leading end <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>&prime; of the male coupling member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</cross-reference>. The arcuate shape and relatively low profile of the annular groove <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> allows the axial force in direction of arrow B to overcome the mechanical coupling of the split ring <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> and annular groove while the split ring <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> is maintained in axial position by the tapered receiving side edge <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> of the annular groove the collar <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>&prime;. Once this mechanical coupling is overcome, the split ring <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> will diametrically expand again so that the annular rib <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> on the male coupling member will pass by it as the male coupling member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and collar <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>&prime; are pulled out from the cavity <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> in the female coupling member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> As will be appreciated by the above description, in the exemplary embodiment, once the C clip <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is removed from between the male coupling member and the female coupling member (if a removable stop such as the C clip <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is used at all), decoupling of the male coupling member from the female coupling member may involve the simple steps of pushing the male coupling member further into the female coupling member and then pulling the male coupling member back out from the female coupling member. This can also be characterized by a reciprocating axial motion. Therefore, if the female coupling member is mounted to a stationary receptacle, for example, it is possible to easily decouple the male and female coupling members manually using one hand. Specifically, by gripping the male coupling member with the one hand and then, while gripping the male coupling member with the one hand, performing the above-described push-pull steps (reciprocating axial motion) to decouple the two components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, the hydraulic hose fitting assembly is designed and dimensioned to meet the SAE-J517 Series 100R12 pressure standard. Such a pressure capacity is established, at least in part, by providing a locking ring <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> cross-sectional diameter adequate to resist sheer forces due to the thrust load of internal pressure in service and by providing the locking ring <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> with an inner diameter that is approximately 1.15 to approximately 1.3 times the size of the nominal outer diameter of the generally cylindrical body <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the male coupling assembly. This nominal outer diameter is approximately the outer diameter of the body <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> near the trailing end <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the body; or alternatively, it is approximately the outer diameter of the circumferential groove. It is noted, however, that the strength of the materials involved is also critical in establishing pressure capabilities, and thus, the above ratios are somewhat dependent upon the physical characteristics of the alloys of construction for the male coupling member, the female coupling member and the locking ring. Higher strength materials would not require as severe a ratio as indicated. In the exemplary embodiment, the generally cylindrical body <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the male coupling member is machined by 13/16 rnd. 12L14 BAR the female coupling member is machined from 15/16 hex-12L15 BAR, and the locking ring <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> is 0.051 carbon spring steel wire (dimensions in inches). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In the exemplary embodiment, the C clip <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is a spring steel clip; however, it will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that alternate clips and materials for clips may be used. For example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, an alternate C clip <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>&prime; is fabricated from a plastic material, such as nylon. It will also be appreciated that other releasable retainers may be utilized in place of the clips disclosed herein while still remaining within the scope of the invention. For example, it is within the scope of the invention to use a break-away clip <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> (&ldquo;one time use&rdquo; clip) as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 8</cross-reference>A. The break-away clip <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is generally in the shape of a ring having a radially narrowed break-away portion <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> that includes a pair of opposed notches or scores <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. Diametrically opposite to the narrowed break-away portion <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is a radially thickened gripping portion <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. This gripping portion <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> may also include a hole <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> extending axially therethrough for receiving a tool or a band (such as a chain, string, wire, etc.) therein. To use, the break-away clip <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is slid axially onto the collar <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> before coupling the male and female coupling members <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> together. When it is desired to decouple the male and female coupling members <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the gripping portion <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is pulled in a radial direction indicated by arrow C, causing the break-away portion <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of the clip to break at the scores <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. Further pulling in direction C, causes the resilient legs <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> formed by the break to spread apart thus allowing the break-away clip <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to be removed from the collar <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>; after which is it discarded. Once the break-away clip <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> has been removed, the male and female coupling members <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may then be decoupled by the reciprocating axial motion of the male coupling member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> with respect to the female coupling member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> as discussed above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> While the exemplary embodiments discussed above pertain to hydraulic hose fitting assemblies, it is within the scope of the invention to utilize the quick connect/disconnect coupling for other purposes, such as, for example, providing a coupling for a pneumatic line, an electrical line or fiberoptic line. Additionally, while the exemplary embodiment is described as being particularly designed for manual coupling and decoupling, it is also within the scope of the invention that modifications can be made so as to utilize either standard or specialized tools in the coupling and/or decoupling operations. </paragraph>
