<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to systems and methods for identifying and/or measuring usage of media data gathered at a user location using remote decoding and/or pattern matching techniques. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Techniques used to determine the programs or other content to which audience members have been exposed are intended to gather such data at the audience members&apos; locations. Various systems have been proposed for this purpose. In one variant, a stationary device is positioned near a television, radio, computer, or the like, in order to monitor media data at audience locations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Another variant proposes the use of a portable device to be carried about by an audience member in order to gather data regarding the programs and other content to which the audience member has been exposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> These devices obtain the signals to be monitored either through a direct electrical connection, or by means of a sensor such as a microphone, light-sensitive device, capacitive pickup or magnetic sensor. Typically the device either detects the presence of an ancillary code in the media data or else extracts a signature therefrom for pattern matching, and stores the code or signature for subsequent processing at a remote location. In order to produce audience surveys which are statistically reliable, it is necessary to engage a relatively large number of survey participants, so that it is likewise necessary to supply a relatively large number of monitoring devices, such as stationary or portable devices. It is, therefore, desirable to minimize the complexity of such devices in order to minimize their cost. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN ADVANTAGEOUS EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates an embodiment of a system for measuring usage of media data representing information received at a user location. The system includes a monitoring device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> at the user location which monitors media data, as indicated by Step <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Where acoustic data including media data, such as audio data, is monitored, the monitoring device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> typically would be a microphone having an input which receives media data in the form of acoustic energy and which serves to transduce the acoustic energy to electrical data. Where media data in the form of light energy, such as video data, is monitored, the monitoring device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> takes the form of a light-sensitive device, such as a photodiode, or a video camera. Light energy including media data could be, for example, light emitted by a video display. The device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can also take the form of a magnetic pickup for sensing magnetic fields associated with a speaker, a capacitive pickup for sensing electric fields or an antenna for electromagnetic energy. In still other embodiments, the device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> takes the form of an electrical connection to a monitored device, which may be a television, a radio, a cable converter, a satellite television system, a game playing system, a VCR, a DVD player, a portable player, a computer, a web appliance, or the like. In still further embodiments, the monitoring device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is embodied in monitoring software running on a computer or other reproduction system to gather media data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In certain embodiments, the monitoring device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is implemented as a stationary monitoring device positioned near a television, radio, computer, web appliance, a cable converter, a satellite television system, a game playing system, a VCR, a DVD player, or the like. In other embodiments, the monitoring device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is implemented as a portable device to be carried about by a user in order to gather data regarding media data to which the user is exposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The monitoring device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is coupled with an input of a processor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> at the user location, so that the processor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can receive the media data from the monitoring device. The processor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is operative to produce a data set representing some, but not all, of the information represented by the media data, as indicated by Step <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The processor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> proceeds to form the data set by eliminating portions of the media data which are not required for further processing at a remote location where either a code (such as an ancillary code and/or identification code) is detected from the data set, or a signature is formed for matching against a library of signatures representing known media data, or both of these processes are carried out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> With reference again to Step <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, in one advantageous embodiment, the processor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> transforms the received media data into frequency-domain data and then selects certain portions of the frequency-domain data in order to form the data set. In accordance with certain alternatives of this embodiment, the media data is transformed into frequency-domain data in the form of amplitude data for each of a plurality of frequency ranges. Each of these ranges corresponds to a pre-determined identification code component and/or ancillary code component which may be present in the media data. In certain ones of these embodiments, the amplitude data are formed by producing ratios of amplitude data in certain frequency ranges to noise levels based on amplitude data outside such frequency ranges. In one variant of this technique, the ratios are formed as signal-to-noise ratios. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In still other embodiments, the data set is formed of time-domain data. In certain embodiments, the data set is formed by sub-sampling time-domain data, or by averaging or combining values of such data over time, or by eliminating time segments of the data. In other embodiments, the time-domain data is produced by selecting a portion of such time-domain data from a frequency range narrower than a frequency range of the media data. In some such embodiments, this time-domain data is formed by filtering the media data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In yet still further embodiments, the data set comprises data representing phase information. Alternative techniques for forming such phase information include comparing the phases of simultaneously occurring components of the media data from different respective frequency ranges or bins, or which constitute one or more single-frequency components, or by comparing time-displaced media data values or through a combination of such techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> A communications device <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is coupled with the processor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to receive the data set. The communications device <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> communicates this data set via a communication system, link or medium <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to a remotely located processing system comprising a further communications device <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and a remote processor <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, as indicated by Step <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. In certain embodiments, the communications device <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is a modem or network card which transforms the data set into a format appropriate for communication via telephone network, a cable television system, a WAN or a wireless communications system. In embodiments which communicate the data wirelessly, the communications device <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> includes an appropriate transmitter, such as a cellular telephone transmitter, a wireless Internet transmission unit, an optical transmitter, an acoustic transmitter or satellite communications transmitter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The device <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is selected as appropriate, to be coupled with the device <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to receive the data set as communicated thereby via the system, link or medium <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The communications device <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is coupled with remote processor <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to provide the data set thereto for producing identification data, as indicated by Step <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In certain embodiments, the remote processor <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> processes the data set to detect an identification code for the media data and/or an ancillary code therein, based on the data set. In other embodiments the remote processor <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> carries out a pattern matching process, by producing a signature for the media data based on the data set and matching the produced signature with a reference signature which is made available at the remotely located processing system. In some embodiments the reference signature is obtained from a database maintained at the remotely located processing system, while in others the reference signature is obtained from a remote source, such as a server which accesses a remotely located database. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The reference signature is associated with identification data serving to identify the media data from which the reference signature has been obtained. Accordingly, once a reliable match of the produced signature with a reference signature has been achieved, the identification data associated with the reference signature serves to identify the media data represented by the received data set. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In certain embodiments, the processor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> forms the data set of frequency-domain data and the processor <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> processes the frequency-domain data in the data set to detect an identification code or an ancillary code therein. Where the codes have been formed as in the Jensen, et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,764,763 or U.S. Pat.

<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> There are advantageous and suitable techniques for carrying out a pattern matching process to identify the media data based on the data set. Several such techniques are described below in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Other suitable techniques for extracting signatures from media data and matching these signatures to reference signatures are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,612,729 to Ellis, et al. and in U.S. Pat. No. 4,739,398 to Thomas, et al., each of which is assigned to the assignee of the present invention and both of which are incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Still other suitable techniques are the subject of U.S. Pat. No. 3,919,479 to Moon, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,697,209 to Kiewit, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,677,466 to Lert, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,512,933 to Wheatley, et al, U.S. Pat. No. 4,955,070 to Welsh, et al., U.S. Pat.

No. 4,230,990 to Lert, et al., all of which are incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In accordance with certain advantageous embodiments of the invention, the monitoring device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> receives media data reproducible as comprehensible images or sounds at a user location, the received media data having ancillary codes therein. The processor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> serves to form the data set from the media data by excluding data required either to reproduce comprehensible images or comprehensible sounds, while including data sufficient to decode identification codes and/or ancillary codes in the media data or to form a signature to identify such data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In certain variants of these embodiments, audio or image data picked up by the monitoring device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is either transformed to the frequency domain or received as frequency-domain data. Those portions of the frequency-domain data not useful to decode an identification code or an ancillary code for audio or image media data or to form a signature to identify such data, are eliminated. Preferably, but not exclusively, the codes have been added to the audio data in accordance with the inaudible encoding techniques of U.S. Pat. No. 5,764,763. Since the codes themselves are inaudible in the reproduced audio data, audible portions of the audio data may be eliminated from the data set without loss of data required to decode the codes. It will be appreciated that other kinds of inaudible codes may be recovered in this manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Similarly, where encoded image data is collected by means of the monitoring device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, it is preferable that the codes to be recovered are visually imperceptible or minimal. In this manner, the data set may be formed to include data necessary to decode the codes, while eliminating data required to reproduce a comprehensible image. Suitable image encoding techniques for producing encoded images having visually imperceptible or minimal encoding artifacts, and decoding the same are the subject of U.S. Pat. No. 6,122,403 to Rhoads, U.S. Pat. No. 6,208,745 to Florencio, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,205,249 to Moskowitz, U.S. Pat. No. 6,198,832 to Maes, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,737,025 to Dougherty, et al., and U.S. Pat. No. 5,737,026 to Lu, et al., all of which are incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In other variants, time domain audio or image media data received by the monitoring device is reduced by eliminating such portions which are not useful to decode such an identification code or ancillary code or form such a signature. Such data reduction can be achieved, for example, by filtering or subsampling, averaging or otherwise combining data, or eliminating time segments of the data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> It is thus possible to vastly reduce the amount of data included in the data set, which facilitates storage and communication of the data set. It also preserves the privacy of audience members in the vicinity of the monitoring device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by preventing reproduction of comprehensible sounds or images. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates an advantageous embodiment in which the data set produced at the user location is formed so that, if an identification code and/or ancillary code is present in the media data, it may be extracted from the data set, but that if such a code is not present, the same data set may be used to produce a signature for use in a signature matching process. In Step <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, time-domain audio data, such as data obtained from the output of a microphone, is transferred to the frequency domain, by Fast Fourier Transform (&ldquo;FFT&rdquo;), wavelet transform, digital filtering, or other time-to-frequency domain transformation. Where the audio data is initially received in the form of frequency-domain data, this step is unnecessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The frequency-domain data is subject to a data extraction process in Step <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to produce a reduced data set, such that data required to detect an identification code and/or ancillary code, if present, is included in the reduced data set, but that a substantial portion of the audio information is not included in the reduced data set. The reduced data set is not merely a compressed version of the audio signal, but also excludes data required to produce a comprehensible version of the audio signal. Consequently, this process not only results in substantial data reduction beyond that which may be achieved in signal compression, but also ensures privacy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The reduced data set so produced is communicated from the user&apos;s location, as indicated by Step <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, to a remotely located processing system. The data set is then subjected to a code detection process <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> carried out by examining the frequency content of the data set. If a code is present, as indicated in Step <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, a record of the code is created in Step <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. In the alternative, or in addition, the detected code is matched with identification data for the media data in a database accessible to the remotely located processing system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> If a code is not detected, a matching process <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is carried out. In the matching process, a signature is produced based on the data set. There are several alternative signature extraction techniques. In one, the entire data set is used without modification as a signature. In anther, a portion of the data set is selected as a signature. In yet another, a signature is produced based on the data set by combining or otherwise processing its data to produce the signature. In certain ones of such processes, pairs of frequency data are selected from the data set and used to form ratios representing components of the produced signature, as in the audio signature formation technique disclosed in Ellis, et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,612,729, incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The signature so produced is then compared with reference signatures stored in a database accessible to the remotely located processing system. The matching process may be carried out, for example, in the manner disclosed by Ellis, et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 5,612,729. Once a reliable match is found, a record of the match is created, as indicated in Step <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> There are a number of suitable techniques for producing the reduced data set in Step <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Where the audio signal has been encoded in accordance with the Srinivasan PCT Publication WO 00/04662, those frequency components which may include the code components are retained, while those which will not are substantially excluded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> An advantageous technique for use with audio data encoded as in the Jensen, et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,764,763 or U.S. Pat. No. 5,450,490 is described in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. In the technique of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the audio data if not already in the frequency domain, is transformed thereto by FFT or another suitable method as indicated in Step <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Noise amplitudes in the frequency neighborhoods of possible code components are estimated in Step <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. This is achieved by examining the amplitudes of frequency components in such neighborhoods. For example, those components having amplitudes below a threshold, such as an average or mean amplitude or a fixed value, are combined and averaged or otherwise processed to produce a representative noise amplitude. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Then in Step <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> signal-to-noise ratios are determined for each possible code component based on data amplitude at its frequency to the noise amplitude in its frequency neighborhood. In one embodiment, those ratios which exceed an upper threshold are rejected as likely representing non-code audio signal components, and those falling below a lower threshold are rejected as noise. This process is carried out in Step <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. In an alternative embodiment, those ratios which would exceed the upper threshold are nevertheless retained when the data set is formed. In still another embodiment, all ratios are retained, and Step <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The retained ratios are stored in Step <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> until it is appropriate to communicate the data set to the remotely located processing system. A decision is made to communicate, as indicated in Step <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, when a predetermined criterion is fulfilled. For example, where the data is gathered with a monitoring device carried by an audience member, the data may be communicated while the device is coupled with a base station, as in the Brooks, et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,483,276. The decision to communicate the data set may instead be determined based on an amount of stored data or on the lapse of time or else upon the establishment of a communication path by the device for transmitting and/or receiving other data. When the criterion for data communication is fulfilled, the stored data set or sets are communicated to the remotely located processing system as indicated in Step <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Since it is possible to encode each data symbol with relatively few frequency components in this embodiment, there are relatively few ratios required in order to decode the symbols at the remotely located processing system. This enables the data set to be restricted in size to facilitate its storage and transmission. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Although the invention has been described with reference to certain advantageous embodiments, arrangements of elements or steps, features and the like, these are not intended to exhaust or exclude all or any possible embodiments, arrangements or features, and indeed other modifications and variations will be ascertainable to those of skill in the art. </paragraph>
