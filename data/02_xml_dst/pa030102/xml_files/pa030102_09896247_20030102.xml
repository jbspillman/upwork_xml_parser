<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to a system and method for detecting gas leakage from an enclosed space, such as fuel vapor leakage from an evaporative emission space of an automotive vehicle fuel system, especially to a system and method where a diaphragm pump positively pressurizes the space during a leak detection test. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A known on-board evaporative emission control system for an automotive vehicle comprises a vapor collection canister that collects volatile fuel vapors generated in the headspace of a fuel tank by the volatilization of liquid fuel in the tank and a purge valve for periodically purging fuel vapors to an intake manifold of the engine. A known type of purge valve, sometimes called a canister purge solenoid (or CPS) valve, is under the control of a microprocessor-based engine management system, sometimes referred to by various names, such as an engine management computer or an engine electronic control unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> During conditions conducive to purging, the purge valve is opened by a signal from the engine management computer in an amount that allows intake manifold vacuum to draw fuel vapors that are present in the tank headspace and/or stored in the canister for entrainment with combustible mixture passing into the engine&apos;s combustion chamber space at a rate consistent with engine operation so as to provide both acceptable vehicle driveability and an acceptable level of exhaust emissions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Certain governmental regulations require that certain automotive vehicles powered by internal combustion engines which operate on volatile fuels such as gasoline, have evaporative emission control systems equipped with an onboard diagnostic capability for determining if a leak is present in the evaporative emission space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> One known type of vapor leak detection system for determining integrity of an evaporative emission space performs a leak detection test by positively pressurizing the evaporative emission space using a positive displacement diaphragm pump. The diaphragm is reciprocated to create test pressure. Commonly owned U.S. Pat. No. 6,192,743, issued Feb. 27, 2001, discloses a module comprising such a pump. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It has been discovered that the output efficiency of such a pump may change due to factors such as temperature, age, friction, etc. As efficiency decreases, the length of time that the pump requires to create a specified pressure within a defined volume increases. Because a window of time that is available for a test may be limited, increases in the time required to create suitable test pressure for allowing a test to proceed may prevent the test from being completed within that window. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In view of this discovery, it would be desirable to provide measures for avoiding significant test time increases as pumping efficiency decreases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to a solution for avoiding such increases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> One general aspect of the invention relates to a leak detection system for a fuel system of an automotive vehicle that contains volatile fuel for operating the vehicle. The leak detection system comprises a diaphragm pump that is repeatedly stroked to pressurize vapor containment space of the fuel system during a leak detection test. A restriction is disposed between the pump and the space being pressurized to cause a graph plot of pressure at the pump outlet ahead of the restriction versus time to comprises a succession of peaks and valleys. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A further aspect includes a processor for determining the difference between the peaks and valleys and for adjusting the frequency at which the pump is stroked to maintain a substantially constant mass airflow into the space as efficiency of the pump changes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Other aspects relate to leak detection methods involving the restriction and the processor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> It is believed that the inventive principles extend to a general method for self-compensating a volumetric pump for decreasing volumetric efficiency so as to maintain a desired mass gas flow into a closed test space being tested for leakage. The pump is operated to pressurize the space during a leak detection test. A restriction disposed between the pump and the space being pressurized to causes a real time pressure trace of pressure between the pump and the restriction to comprise a succession of pulses having peaks and valleys. Data from the pressure trace is used to adjust pump operation to cause the pump to maintain the desired mass gas flow as pump efficiency changes. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows an example of a portion of an automotive vehicle fuel system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, including a leak detection system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A fuel tank <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> holds a supply of volatile liquid fuel for an engine <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> that powers the vehicle. Fuel vapors that are generated within headspace of tank <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are collected in a vapor collection canister <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> that forms a portion of an evaporative emission control system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> At times conducive to canister purging, the collected vapors are purged from canister <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to engine <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> through a purge valve <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. For purging, purge valve <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and a canister vent valve <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are both open. Vent valve <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> vents canister <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to atmosphere, allowing engine manifold vacuum to draw air into and through canister <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> where collected vapors entrain with the air flowing through the canister and are carried into the engine intake system, and ultimately into engine <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> where they are combusted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> From time to time, leak detection system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> conducts a leak detection test for ascertaining the integrity of the evaporative emission control system against leakage. Purge valve <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and vent valve <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are operated closed to close off the space of the evaporative emission system that contains the fuel vapors. That space is then positively pressurized to determine if any leakage is present. A diaphragm pump <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, as described above, is used to pressurize the space being tested. Although the space has been closed off, the pump is still able to draw air from atmosphere through a filter <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to develop suitable positive pressure in the space for conducting the test. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Details of such a pump and an associated module, and leak test procedures, are well disclosed in commonly owned U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,967,124; 5,974,861; 6,009,746; 6,016,691; 6,016,793; and 6,192,743 where vent valve <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is integrated with the module and pump <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is housed with the module enclosure. The module has ports for establishing proper communication of the pump and vent valve with the emission control system and atmosphere. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> As shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, pump <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> comprises a movable wall <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> that has an outer perimeter margin held sealed to the pump housing so as to create a variable volume pumping chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> within the pump interior. When the pump is stroked to displace movable wall <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in a direction that increases the volume of pumping chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, atmospheric air can pass through a first one-way valve <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to create a charge of air in pumping chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> while a second one-way valve <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> between the outlet of the pump and the space being tested prevents the pump from sucking air out of that space. When pump <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is stroked to displace movable wall <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in an opposite direction that decreases the volume of pumping chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the charge of air in the pumping chamber is forced through the second one-way valve <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> into the space being tested, while the first one-way valve <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> prevents the charge from being forced back into the atmosphere. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Pump is repeatedly stroked back and forth in this manner until pressure suitable for performing the leak detection test has been created in the space under test. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The sensing of pressure in the space under test is performed by a pressure sensor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> that is integrated with the leak detection module. The sensing port of sensor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is communicated to sense pressure immediately after valve <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> By providing a restriction between valve <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the space being tested, a characteristic that is useful in ascertaining the efficiency of the pump may be imparted to a real time pressure trace of sensed pressure. The restriction may comprise a disc <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> containing an orifice <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, or an orifice <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> that is integrally formed in an internal wall of the module, as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The volume between valve <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the restriction forms a chamber <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. The characteristic imparted to the real time pressure trace is a succession of pulses, sometimes referred to for convenience as a heartbeat, and that characteristic can be seen in the two traces of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> When pump <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is first operated, pressure in the space being tested is at, or at least near, atmospheric pressure, and a representative pressure trace would appear like trace <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Trace <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> shows one pump burst that comprises a succession of pulses (heartbeats) consisting of peaks <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and valleys <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Each pulse corresponds to a cycle of the pump where wall <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is stroked forward to force air out of pumping chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and then retracted backward. The rising portion of a pulse toward a peak <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> occurs as a charge of air in pumping chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is being forced out of the pump to build pressure in chamber <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. The falling portion of a pulse occurs as movable wall <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is being retracted. As the pump is repeatedly cycled, pressure will gradually build to a residual pressure that remains when pump cycling ceases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> When pump <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is operating at less than normal efficiency, a representative real time pressure trace would appear like trace <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Trace <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> comprises a succession of peaks <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and valleys <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> corresponding to stroking of the pump, but the pressure difference between each peak and the adjacent valley is noticeably less than in a pump of normal efficiency. The pressure will gradually build, but the residual pressure will be noticeably less than that of the normal pump. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The pressure difference between the peaks and valleys is a measure indicative of the pump efficiency. The residual pressure is also a measure of pump efficiency. Therefore the difference between the peaks and valleys of trace <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may be compared against the difference between the peaks and valleys of trace <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The result of the comparison is a measured of the extent to which the pump efficiency has decreased from normal efficiency. The difference between the residual pressures may also be taken to measure loss of efficiency. The result of one or both of those comparisons is used to adjust the number of times that the pump is stroked during a pump burst. As pump efficiency decreases, the number of pump strokes forming a pump burst is increased to maintain a substantially constant mass airflow into the test space during a pressurizing burst. The computations are performed by an on-board processor, such as processor <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, thereby making the pump self-compensating so that it will create the desired mass airflow. As shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, pulse bursts form only portions of the total test time, and so increasing the number of pump strokes in a burst causes only a small increase in overall test time. The processor has been programmed with stored data defining normal pump efficiency, and when calculating efficiency at the beginning of a test compares the actual heartbeat data with the programmed data to determine if additional strokes, and how many of them, need to be added to subsequent pulse bursts to cause the desired mass airflow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> It is preferable that the calculation of pump efficiency be made at the beginning of pump operation, i.e. at the end of the first pump burst while pressure in the space being tested is at or near atmospheric pressure. Once pressure begins to increase significantly above atmospheric, the accuracy of the efficiency calculation begins to decrease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> It is to be understood that because the invention may be practiced in various forms within the scope of the appended claims, certain specific words and phrases that may be used to describe a particular exemplary embodiment of the invention are not intended to necessarily limit the scope of the invention solely on account of such use. </paragraph>
