<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A WDM input signal received at an add/drop node is coupled onto both a &ldquo;drop&rdquo; transmission path and a &ldquo;through&rdquo; transmission path within the node. Optical channels to be dropped are then processed within the &ldquo;drop&rdquo; path, such as by optical demultiplexing. Because a copy of the same WDM input signal is routed on the &ldquo;through&rdquo; path, a dynamically configurable and programmable wavelength blocker selectively blocks the optical channels that are being dropped from the WDM input signal and passes through those optical channels not being dropped onto the &ldquo;through&rdquo; path. In an &ldquo;add&rdquo; path within the node, optical channels are selectively added, such as by using optical multiplexing. Those optical channels from the multiplexed optical signal that are not designated for &ldquo;add&rdquo; (e.g., &ldquo;unused&rdquo; channels) are selectively blocked within the &ldquo;add&rdquo; transmission path.

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates generally to optical communication systems employing wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) and, more particularly, to adding and dropping individual optical channels from a WDM signal in such optical communication systems. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Optical fiber is fast becoming a transmission medium of choice for many communication networks because of the speed and bandwidth advantages associated with optical transmission. In addition, wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) is being used to meet the increasing demands for more capacity in optical communication networks. As is well known, WDM combines many optical channels each at a different wavelength for simultaneous transmission as a composite optical signal in a single optical fiber. By using optical transmission and WDM in the backbone networks, the communications industry has made great strides in terms of offering greater capacity and transmission speeds in today&apos;s networks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Management of this increased capacity in WDM systems, i.e., managing the communications traffic transported in many different optical channels, is an important aspect of any WDM-based communication network. For example, both long haul and metropolitan WDM systems typically include an add/drop capability whereby signals transported on the individual optical channels can be selectively added or dropped at various nodes in a network. Conventional approaches to optical add/drop systems are typically based on extracting the entire signal power for a selected wavelength at an add/drop node. Some examples of components used for optical add/drop include inline arrayed waveguide grating routers (AWG), fiber Bragg gratings (FBG), or Mach-Zehnder (MZF) filters, to name a few. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Add/drop capability in existing systems is limited in several aspects. For example, the total number of channels that can be added or dropped between end terminals is generally limited. The availability of particular channels for add/drop at any given node is also typically limited, especially in those systems that employ a banding approach whereby groups of channels are allocated for add/drop at designated nodes, e.g., a first group of channels (channels 1-8) for add/drop at a first node, a second group of channels (channels 9-16) for add/drop at a second node, and so on. Accordingly, certain channels are therefore only &ldquo;available&rdquo; for add/drop at a particular node or nodes. Some systems do not allow an optical channel of a particular wavelength to be both added and dropped at the same node. Some systems also do not allow for wavelength reuse, e.g., where two separate circuits of communications traffic between different pairs of nodes can share the same wavelength in a network. In many WDM systems, reconfiguring add/drop assignments at a node, e.g., changing an optical channel from &ldquo;drop&rdquo; to &ldquo;through&rdquo; routing, requires on-site intervention by technicians. Consequently, all of these limitations contribute to a lesser capability to manage the bandwidth of a WDM system, e.g., to reuse wavelengths, provide selective and programmable add/drop at any given node, and so on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> These limitations in existing add/drop arrangements are generally attributable to the particular components being used as well as design limitations in configurations employing these components. For example, some of these limitations include insertion losses of commercially available components, polarization-dependent losses in the transmission path, power divergence in the optical channels of a WDM signal (e.g., different power levels in the optical channels), filter narrowing effects in a transmission path having a plurality of concatenated add/drop nodes (e.g., because filter characteristics are not perfectly matched from node to node), and channel spacing (e.g., wavelength separation) between the individual optical channels in a WDM signal, especially as the number of channels in a WDM system increases. Further complicating the design of an add/drop arrangement is the fact that solutions to some of these problems are at cross-purposes with each other. For example, equalization techniques to correct power divergence can lead to higher insertion losses and so on. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A flexible, selective, and programmable add/drop solution capable of adding and dropping each of the optical channels in a WDM optical signal can be realized according to the principles of the invention in an add/drop node that employs selective wavelength blocking to facilitate routing in the &ldquo;add&rdquo;, &ldquo;drop&rdquo;, and &ldquo;through&rdquo; transmission paths within the node. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In one illustrative embodiment, a WDM input signal received at an add/drop node is coupled, e.g., using an optical signal tap, onto both a transmission path within the node designated for dropping optical channels and a transmission path within the node designated for &ldquo;through&rdquo; routing of optical channels, e.g., those not being dropped. Those optical channels to be dropped are then processed within the &ldquo;drop&rdquo; transmission path, such as by optical demultiplexing. Because a copy of the same WDM input signal is routed onto the &ldquo;through&rdquo; transmission path, a wavelength blocker is used in the &ldquo;through&rdquo; transmission path to selectively block the optical channels that are being dropped from the WDM input signal. In this manner, only optical channels not being dropped at the add/drop node are therefore passed on the &ldquo;through&rdquo; transmission path. In another transmission path within the node, optical channels can be selectively added, such as by using an optical multiplexer arrangement to supply one or more optical channels to be added. Those optical channels not being added for output from the node are selectively blocked within the add transmission path. As a result, the optical channels from the add transmission path are combined with the optical channels in the through transmission path to generate a WDM output signal for transmission from the add/drop node. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> By incorporating selective wavelength blocking within the &ldquo;add&rdquo; and &ldquo;through&rdquo; paths according to the principles of the invention, a dynamically configurable and programmable add/drop capability is achieved which can be provisioned, locally or remotely, to accommodate changing add/drop requirements. Moreover, the use of wavelength blockers in an add/drop node provides an advantage over existing add/drop filtering arrangements that are particularly susceptible to the aforementioned filter narrowing effects, higher losses, cascadability limitations in terms of the number of concatenated add/drop nodes in a transmission path, and so on.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> A brief review of some terminology commonly used when describing add/drop in the WDM context will be helpful to understanding terms used in the detailed description of the invention that follows. In WDM systems that transport a WDM signal having a plurality of optical channels of different wavelengths, add/drop generically refers to a capability whereby individual optical channels are removed from the WDM signal and/or added to the WDM signal. At a typical add/drop node, an optical channel of a particular wavelength in an incoming WDM signal can generally either be dropped from the WDM signal, passed through the add/drop node without being dropped, or both dropped and routed through (&ldquo;drop and continue&rdquo;). An optical channel of a particular wavelength can also be added to the WDM signal. Because most WDM systems today only allow a subset of the total number of channels to be dropped due to the aforementioned limitations, optical channels that are passed through a node without being dropped typically fall into one of two categories. In particular, an optical channel that could be dropped (e.g., allocated for drop) but is not selected for drop at a particular node is typically called a &ldquo;through&rdquo; channel. By contrast, an optical channel that cannot be added or dropped at a particular node, e.g., it is not within the subset or band of channels that can be dropped, is typically called an &ldquo;express&rdquo; channel. That is, the channel is expressly routed through the node bypassing all components in the node associated with the add/drop function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a simplified network configuration in which the principles of the invention can be used. In particular, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a 2-fiber linear system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> comprising a pair of end terminals <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> with one or more repeaters <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and/or optical add/drop nodes <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> therebetween. As is well known, repeater <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> would be used, for example, to amplify the WDM signal being transported through the WDM system without providing an add/drop capability. As shown, system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> shows two directions of communication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In operation, N optical channels <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> (labeled as &lgr;<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>to &lgr;<highlight><subscript>N</subscript></highlight>) are multiplexed to form WDM signal <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> at end terminal <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. WDM signal <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is then routed via optical fiber to add/drop node <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> where N optical channels <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> can be dropped from WDM signal <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and added to WDM signal <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Add/drop node <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> then generates WDM signal <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> which comprises N optical channels <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> of the same wavelengths as WDM signal <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, but possibly carrying different communications traffic on one or more of the optical channels that were added or dropped from the original incoming WDM signal <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. From add/drop node <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>, WDM signal <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> is then transported through repeater <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, where signal amplification occurs by well-known means, and then on to add/drop node <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> where add/drop processing similar to that previously described for add/drop node <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> occurs. Briefly, add/drop node <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> receives WDM signal <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, adds/drops selected ones of N optical channels <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>, and outputs WDM signal <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. Again, WDM signal <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> includes N optical channels <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> of the same wavelengths as incoming WDM signal <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, but possibly carrying different communications traffic depending on the add/drop processing that occurred at add/drop node <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. WDM signal <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is then transmitted to end terminal <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> where optical demultiplexing and other well-known processing occurs to generate N individual optical channels <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>. The other direction of communication, from end terminal <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to end terminal <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> will be similar to that previously described for communication from end terminal <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> to end terminal <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and will not be repeated here for sake of brevity. It should be noted that system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is shown in simplified block diagram form and is only meant to represent one illustrative example. Accordingly, the principles of the invention are not meant to be limited in any manner by the exemplary configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a simplified block diagram of add/drop node <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> according to one illustrative embodiment of the invention. For simplicity of illustration and explanation, only one direction of communication over a single optical fiber is shown through add/drop node <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> although it is contemplated that add/drop node <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> may support another direction of communication over another optical fiber using a similar configuration as described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> A WDM input signal <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is received by add/drop node <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> and coupled into two different optical paths <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> by tap <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> so that each of paths <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> carries all of the optical channels in WDM input signal <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. By way of example, coupling can be accomplished using well-known techniques and commercially available devices, such as a so-called 90/10 tap coupler. As is well-known, a 90/10 tap coupler couples the WDM signal with 90% of the optical power into one path and the WDM signal with 10% of the optical power into the other path. In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, </cross-reference>10% of the optical power is routed into path <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> while 90% of the optical power is routed into path <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Optical demultiplexer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is coupled to path <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> for receiving and demultiplexing the WDM signal into its constituent optical channels <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>, labeled here as &lgr;<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>to &lgr;<highlight><subscript>N</subscript></highlight>. In this manner, any of optical channels <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> can be dropped at add/drop node <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. Other components needed for extracting the optical channels to be dropped are not shown here, e.g., filters, receivers, and so on, however, various well-known techniques and components are suitable for dropping selected ones of optical channels <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> from the demultiplexed WDM signal. The selective dropping of particular optical channels <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> can be controlled via standard control techniques used in WDM systems having add/drop elements, e.g., messaging and commands via system and board-level controllers, supervisory channels, and so on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Many commercially available devices can be used to provide the demultiplexing function of optical demultiplexer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. By way of example, an arrayed waveguide grating (AWG), commonly referred to as a waveguide grating router (WGR), is one such optical demultiplexer although there are numerous other devices that are suitable for extracting one or more optical channels of particular wavelengths from a WDM signal. For example only, other devices include, but are not limited to, thin film filters, grating-based devices, and so on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Because a copy of WDM input signal <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is also routed to path <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> for &ldquo;through&rdquo; routing, the present invention can support a &ldquo;drop&rdquo; (with or without add) as well as a &ldquo;drop and continue&rdquo; operation. That is, an optical channel can be dropped via path <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and blocked in path <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> if it was desirable to drop the channel without any &ldquo;through&rdquo; routing. In this manner, an optical channel of the same wavelength could be added back to WDM input signal <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, if desired, at node <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> as will be described below. Alternatively, a &ldquo;drop and continue&rdquo; operation could be supported whereby the optical channel being dropped via path <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is also allowed to continue along path <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> without being blocked. Subsequent control would then be needed in this example to ensure that an optical channel of the same wavelength is not added to WDM input signal <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> thereby causing a collision. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> As described and when appropriate, those optical channels that are dropped via path <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> can be blocked in path <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. This can be accomplished according to one illustrative embodiment using wavelength blocker <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight>. Responsive to control signals, commands, and so on from a control system or element, wavelength blocker <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> is a per-channel wavelength blocker that is configurable to selectively block certain optical channels that are being dropped via path <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> while passing all other optical channels. The optical channels provided as output from wavelength blocker <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> are routed onto path <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>, labeled here as &ldquo;through&rdquo; path <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>. In this manner, wavelength blocker <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> is used to control the selective routing of optical channels in &ldquo;through&rdquo; path <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> as a function of which optical channels are being dropped via path <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. In one illustrative embodiment, wavelength blocker <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> can be controlled by software to selectively block or pass each optical channel (by wavelength), thus adding a remote provisionability feature. In particular, the drop requirements for a particular node, such as add/drop node <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>, can be provisioned remotely and dynamically in response to changing system requirements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Various implementations are contemplated for wavelength blocker <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> and the selection of the appropriate device will depend on system design considerations that are within the skill in the art. By way of example, wavelength blocker <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> can be implemented with opto-mechanical shutters, liquid crystal technology, and so on. Some exemplary types of wavelength blockers are disclosed in U.S. Ser. No. 09/809,124, filed on Mar. 15, 2001, entitled &ldquo;Planar Lightwave Wavelength Blocker&rdquo; and U.S. Ser. No. 09/809,126, filed on Mar. 15, 2001, entitled &ldquo;Planar Lightwave Wavelength Blocker Devices Using Micromachines&rdquo;, both of which are incorporated by reference in their entirety. Generally, wavelength blockers such as these and other equivalent devices are not as lossy as those devices used in prior art add/drop systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The optical channels passed by wavelength blocker <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> are routed on &ldquo;through&rdquo; path <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> to combiner <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> where they are combined with any optical channels being added via add path <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight>. More specifically, optical channels <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> to be added to the WDM signal at add/drop node <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> would be assigned wavelengths consistent with the existing wavelength assignments in the WDM signal. In this manner, wavelength re-use can be employed to provide a further advantage with respect to bandwidth management at the optical layer. Using a typical add/drop scenario as an example, an optical channel having wavelength &lgr;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, would be dropped at node <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> via drop path <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and optical demultiplexer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> as previously described. As such, the optical channel having wavelength &lgr;<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>would be blocked by wavelength blocker <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> so that it would not be present on &ldquo;through&rdquo; path <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>. An optical channel having the same wavelength &lgr;<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>could then be added to the WDM signal via add path <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> One way to add optical channels in this manner is according to the illustrative embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. More specifically, optical multiplexer <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight> is used to multiplex N optical channels <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> (e.g., having the same wavelength assignments as the WDM input signal <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>) to form a composite WDM signal. Any of the N optical channels <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> can be the optical channel carrying communication traffic that is to be added to the WDM signal. However, because only one or more (but probably less than N) optical channels are actually carrying communication traffic to be added to the WDM signal, the WDM signal output by optical multiplexer <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight> is coupled to wavelength blocker <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> which would operate similarly to wavelength blocker <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> as previously described. That is, wavelength blocker <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> would selectively pass or block individual optical channels such that only those optical channels that are actually to be added at add/drop node <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> would be allowed to pass via &ldquo;add&rdquo; path <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> to combiner <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. All other &ldquo;unused&rdquo; optical channels carried in add path <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> would be blocked by wavelength blocker <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> in order to prevent signal collisions with optical channels having the same wavelengths in &ldquo;through&rdquo; path <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, all optical channels being dropped or added at add/drop node <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> would be blocked by the respective wavelength blocker <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> in this illustrative embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Many commercially available devices can be used for optical multiplexer <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight>. By way of example, the aforementioned waveguide grating router (WGR) is one such optical multiplexer although there are numerous other devices that are suitable for adding one or more optical channels of particular wavelengths to a WDM signal. Another example is an optical combiner. Other alternatives for adding optical channels will also be apparent to those skilled in the art. For example, wavelength-selective components can be used to only add selected optical channels thus obviating the need for wavelength blocker <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In prior arrangements employing an optical multiplexer or similar device, any changes in the add/drop requirements, e.g., changing which channels are to be added, would require manual intervention, such as to change jumpers on the optical multiplexer, and so on. As such, adding optical channels was not programmable such as from a remote location, for example. By contrast and according to the principles of the invention, the add function is remotely programmable and controllable because the optical multiplexer is configured to multiplex all of the optical channels for routing to wavelength blocker <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> which is then used to pass or block out the appropriate channels, e.g., to pass only those optical channels that are to be added to the output signal. In this manner, the selective add function can be remotely programmed and controlled since wavelength blocker <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is a remotely programmable device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Combiner <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> then combines the optical channels in &ldquo;through&rdquo; path <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> with the individual optical channels being added from &ldquo;add&rdquo; path <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> to generate WDM output signal <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, WDM output signal includes a plurality of optical channels using the same wavelengths as in WDM input signal <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, but possibly carrying different communications traffic depending on whether individual optical channels were dropped and/or added at add/drop node <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. Various commercially available devices and techniques can be used to combine the optical channels being added via &ldquo;add&rdquo; path <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> with the optical channels being routed from &ldquo;through&rdquo; path <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> By using selective wavelength blocking in conjunction with the illustrative routing configuration of the &ldquo;drop&rdquo;, &ldquo;add&rdquo;, and &ldquo;through&rdquo; paths <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> respectively, add/drop node <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> therefore provides a selective and dynamically reconfigurable add/drop function that allows for remote provisioning in response to changing add/drop requirements. Moreover, wavelength blockers provide an advantage over existing add/drop filtering arrangements which are particularly susceptible to the aforementioned filter narrowing effects, higher losses, cascadability limitations in terms of the number of add/drop nodes that can be concatenated in a transmission path, and so on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Control of wavelength blockers <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> to selectively block different optical channels depending on the particular add/drop requirements at a node can be implemented in a number of ways that will be apparent to one skilled in the art. In one illustrative embodiment, software-based control may be used to implement a channel assignment algorithm so that the wavelength blockers can be programmed to add and drop different optical channels depending on the particular add/drop assignments for the individual optical channels at any given time in a node. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> As an example, when a request to add an optical channel of a particular wavelength (e.g., &lgr;<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>) at a node is received, the status of that particular optical channel is checked at each of wavelength blockers <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> before an &ldquo;add&rdquo; association is entered for optical channel &lgr;<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>at that node. For example, well-known optical signal monitoring could be used to detect the absence or presence of an optical signal at a particular wavelength in a transmission path. Common optical monitoring techniques could include the use of optical spectrum analyzers, photodetectors and associated circuitry, and so on. If either of wavelength blockers <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is already configured or otherwise provisioned to pass optical channel &lgr;<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>, as determined through an optical monitoring or other suitable technique, then the request to now add &lgr;<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>would be denied in order to avoid a so-called &ldquo;collision&rdquo; whereby interference and other deleterious effects would occur. If the presence of the optical signal at &lgr;<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>is not detected at the output of wavelength blockers <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, either because &lgr;<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>was not originally present in WDM input signal <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> or because wavelength blockers <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> are already configured or otherwise provisioned to block &lgr;<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>, then the request to now add can be provisioned at the node. In this example, wavelength blocker <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> coupled to &ldquo;through&rdquo; path <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> would be set to block a while wavelength blocker <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> in &ldquo;add&rdquo; path <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> would be set to pass &lgr;<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Similarly, an optical channel cannot be reconfigured to &ldquo;through&rdquo; path <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> when that same optical channel having the same wavelength is being added via &ldquo;add&rdquo; path <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight>. As such, the programming of wavelength blockers <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> would have to be verified to check their current states with respect to the optical channel of interest. In another embodiment, control of the add/drop functions and, in particular, the states of wavelength blockers <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> can be coordinated among more than one add/drop node in a transmission path. In this manner, channel assignments and reconfigurations for add/drop requests can be coordinated among nodes to ensure that collisions do not occur not only within a particular node but also at a downstream node. For example, in addition to checking within a particular node before reconfiguring the wavelength blockers, software-based control can be used to facilitate the same types of checks at one or more downstream nodes so that an optical channel is not reconfigured to the &ldquo;through&rdquo; path of an upstream node when that optical channel having the same wavelength is being added at a downstream node without first being dropped. Other collision scenarios will be apparent to those skilled in the art as well as the control arrangements to facilitate channel assignments to avoid such collisions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the invention, an add/drop arrangement including wavelength blockers can provide another advantage over the conventional add/drop arrangements. In particular, a dynamic gain equalization function (DGEF) can be incorporated within wavelength blockers <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> to provide per-channel gain equalization so that all &ldquo;through&rdquo; and &ldquo;add&rdquo; channels are essentially at the same power level when outputted from the respective wavelength blockers <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. Dynamically adjusting gain of the optical channels therefore can effectively compensate for the aforementioned power divergence that may occur in the optical channels and which worsens as optical channels traverse multiple repeater (e.g., amplifier) and other add/drop nodes. For one exemplary dynamic gain equalization approach, see U.S. Pat. No. 6,212,315 issued Apr. 3, 2001 to C. Doerr and entitled &ldquo;<highlight><italic>Channel Power Equalizer for a Wavelength Division Multiplexed System&rdquo;. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows another illustrative embodiment of an add/drop node <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> incorporating interleaving to increase channel spacing between adjacent optical channels thereby improving the add/drop performance at the node. More specifically, interleaving (and de-interleaving) of a WDM signal can be used to increase channel spacing to avoid the aforementioned problems of prior art arrangements and also to enable use of other commercially available devices for adding and dropping channels which might otherwise not be suitable because of channel spacing considerations. Again, system design considerations will likely dictate the actual type and configuration of components. Because node <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> includes many of the same components as node <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>), which perform in the same or similar manner, only differences between the embodiments shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference> will be described here for sake of brevity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> As shown, wavelength interleaver <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> separates (e.g., de-interleaves) individual optical channels within WDM input signal <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> according to a prescribed pattern or arrangement so that channel spacing between the optical channels is thereby increased. In one exemplary embodiment, interleaver <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> generates a first group of optical channels in path <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and a second group of optical channels in path <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> such that all odd numbered optical channels (i.e., &lgr;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, &lgr;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, &lgr;<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, . . . &lgr;<highlight><subscript>N&minus;1</subscript></highlight>) are on path <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> while all even numbered optical channels (i.e., &lgr;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, &lgr;<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, . . . &lgr;<highlight><subscript>N</subscript></highlight>) are on path <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>. In this manner, channel spacing between adjacent optical channels in WDM input signal <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> is increased, thereby minimizing other potential problems associated with the closer channel spacing such as insertion losses in downstream components, crosstalk, and so on. By way of example, an exemplary WDM system may carry <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> optical channels with channel spacing in the WDM input signal <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> being 50 GHz. By separating at least every other channel into a different one of paths <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>, the channel spacing for the WDM signal in each of paths <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> becomes 100 GHz. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Interleavers or other devices having comparable function are commercially available and are contemplated for use in various embodiments of the invention. By way of example only, one such interleaver is a 50/100 GHz passive interleaver manufactured by companies such as JDS Uniphase and others. Other exemplary devices include so-called wavelength &ldquo;slicers&rdquo; manufactured by companies such as Chorum Technologies and others. Other alternative devices and arrangements will also be apparent to those skilled in the art. As such, the foregoing examples are meant to be illustrative only and not limiting in any way. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Tap <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, optical demultiplexer <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, and wavelength blocker <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> in path <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> are similar to the corresponding components in the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and will not be described here in detail for sake of brevity. Briefly, these components are similarly used for dropping selected optical channels <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> via drop path <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> and for routing selected optical channels via &ldquo;through&rdquo; path <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight>. The only significant difference between this embodiment and that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is that only a subset of the total number of optical channels from WDM input signal <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> are being processed for &ldquo;drop&rdquo; and &ldquo;through&rdquo; routing in path <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, e.g., odd numbered optical channels having wavelengths &lgr;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, &lgr;<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, . . . &lgr;<highlight><subscript>N&minus;1</subscript></highlight>. Similarly, tap <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight>, optical demultiplexer <highlight><bold>365</bold></highlight> and wavelength blocker <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> in path <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> perform a similar function as those same components in path <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> (as well as the corresponding components in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>), but only for another subset of the total number of optical channels from WDM input signal <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, e.g., even numbered optical channels having wavelengths &lgr;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, &lgr;<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, . . . &lgr;<highlight><subscript>N</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> As with the corresponding components in the illustrative embodiment in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, optical multiplexer <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight>, wavelength blocker <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> and combiner <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> in add path <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> are similarly used for adding optical channels to the WDM signal. As such, the basic operation of these components for adding the optical channels is the same and will not be repeated here for sake of brevity. In this embodiment, however, the optical channels to be added to the WDM signal, i.e., those that are added at optical multiplexer <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> and not blocked by wavelength blocker <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>, are first combined in combiner <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> with the optical channels in &ldquo;through&rdquo; path <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Interleaver <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> is then used to interleave or otherwise combine the optical channels in through paths <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> with those optical channels generated as output from combiner <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. The optical channels generated as output from combiner <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> include the optical channels routed in &ldquo;through&rdquo; path <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> as well as the optical channels being added via &ldquo;add&rdquo; path <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight> that are not blocked by wavelength blocker <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>. In this manner, WDM output signal <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> is generated from interleaver <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> to include a combination of optical channels from WDM input signal <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> that are not dropped at node <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> along with optical channels being added at node <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>. As previously described, various commercially available interleaver and combiner devices may be suitably used to perform the function of interleaver <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> and are therefore contemplated for use according to the principles of the invention. By way of example, a 50/100 GHz passive interleaver is one of several commercially available devices suitable for this purpose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows another illustrative embodiment of an add/drop node <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> incorporating an express routing capability, optical amplification to compensate for losses, growth capability for add/drop, and interleaving to increase channel spacing between adjacent optical channels. As shown, WDM input signal <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> is supplied to interleaver <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> which performs a similar function as described in the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. In this illustrative embodiment, interleaver <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> separates individual optical channels within WDM input signal <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> according to a prescribed pattern or arrangement such that a first group of optical channels in path <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> include all odd numbered optical channels (i.e., &lgr;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, &lgr;<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, . . . &lgr;<highlight><subscript>N&minus;1</subscript></highlight>) while a second group of optical channels in path <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> include all even numbered optical channels (i.e., &lgr;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, &lgr;<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, . . . &lgr;<highlight><subscript>N</subscript></highlight>). Following the previous embodiment, the optical channels in WDM input signal <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> could be spaced apart by 50 GHz and a 50/100 GHz interleaver could be used to provide a 100 GHz separation in the channels supplied as output from interleaver <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> An express routing capability is provided according to the principles of the invention for the optical channels in path <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. In particular, these optical channels are routed directly through node <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> without passing through any components associated with dropping channels. In this example, the odd numbered optical channels (i.e., &lgr;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, &lgr;<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, . . . &lgr;<highlight><subscript>N&minus;1</subscript></highlight>) are expressly routed from path <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> through variable optical attenuator <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>, which is a commercially available device useful for controlling the signal power level of the optical channels. For example, variable optical attenuator <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> can be used to maintain power levels of the &ldquo;express&rdquo; optical channels to be relatively equal to the levels of the &ldquo;through&rdquo; and &ldquo;add&rdquo; optical channels. These &ldquo;express&rdquo; optical channels are then supplied to interleaver <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The even numbered optical channels (i.e., &lgr;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, &lgr;<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, . . . &lgr;<highlight><subscript>N</subscript></highlight>) in path <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> are first routed through optical amplifier <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight> and then to a conventional 90/10 tap coupler <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> which operates similarly to taps <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, tap coupler <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> taps off 90% of the optical signal power of the incoming WDM signal (optical channels &lgr;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, &lgr;<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, . . . &lgr;<highlight><subscript>N</subscript></highlight>) and routes these along path <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> to wavelength blocker <highlight><bold>425</bold></highlight>. 10% of the optical signal power of the incoming WDM signal (optical channels &lgr;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, &lgr;<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, . . . &lgr;<highlight><subscript>N</subscript></highlight>) is tapped off and routed via &ldquo;drop&rdquo; path <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> to optical amplifier <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Each of optical amplifiers <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> provide amplification of the optical signals to compensate for the losses that the signals will incur in the respective paths. For example, because only 10% of the optical signal power is being routed via &ldquo;drop&rdquo; path <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, optical amplifier <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> is useful for boosting the signal power of the optical channels to be dropped at node <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight>. Similarly, optical amplifier <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight> is particularly useful for boosting the optical signal power of the optical channels that are being routed in &ldquo;through&rdquo; path <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight> to compensate for loss on the &ldquo;through&rdquo; path <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight> and also to balance optical signal power levels of the &ldquo;through&rdquo; optical channels with those optical channels being added at node <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> as will be described in further detail below. Other amplification schemes will be apparent to those skilled in the art and are a matter of design choice based on factors such as required signal levels, loss &ldquo;budget&rdquo; for the system, nodes, and so on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> An optional interleaver <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> can be used in &ldquo;drop&rdquo; path <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> to further increase the channel spacing of the optical channels being dropped. In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, interleaver <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> can be a 100/200 GHz interleaver wherein the incoming optical channels &lgr;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, &lgr;<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, . . . &lgr;<highlight><subscript>N </subscript></highlight>are spaced apart by 100 GHz and each group of optical channels output from interleaver <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> has a channel spacing of 200 GHz. As shown, optical demultiplexer <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> can be used to separate optical channels &lgr;<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, &lgr;<highlight><subscript>8</subscript></highlight>, . . . &lgr;<highlight><subscript>N </subscript></highlight>while optical demultiplexer <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> can be used to separate optical channels &lgr;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, &lgr;<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>, . . . &lgr;<highlight><subscript>N-2</subscript></highlight>. In this manner, the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> provides a growth capability in that a system may be initially configured without one of optical demultiplexers <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> and, as drop requirements change, the applicable optical demultiplexer can be added to accommodate additional drop requirements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Similar to the previous embodiments, wavelength blocker (with optional DGEF) <highlight><bold>425</bold></highlight> is provisionable, e.g., by software-based or other control mechanisms, to selectively block or pass optical channels. In particular, wavelength blocker <highlight><bold>425</bold></highlight> would be provisioned to block wavelengths corresponding to those optical channels being dropped via path <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> as in the preceding embodiments. Those optical channels not blocked by wavelength blocker <highlight><bold>425</bold></highlight> would be routed along &ldquo;through&rdquo; path <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight> to combiner <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> to be combined with the optical channels being added at node <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> as will be described in more detail below. The primary difference between the &ldquo;express&rdquo; optical channels in path <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and the &ldquo;through&rdquo; optical channels in path <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight> is that the optical channels in &ldquo;through&rdquo; path <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight> can be dropped depending on the particular provisioning that is in effect at any given time whereas the &ldquo;express&rdquo; optical channels cannot be dropped at node <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Optical channels are added to the WDM signal at node <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> in a similar manner as described for the preceding embodiments. However, the illustrative embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> provides an additional growth capability in that node <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> can be initially configured with a single optical multiplexer and additional optical multiplexers can be added as the &ldquo;add&rdquo; requirements change for node <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight>. In this example, optical multiplexer <highlight><bold>435</bold></highlight> is shown to process optical channels having wavelengths &lgr;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, &lgr;<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, . . . &lgr;<highlight><subscript>N&minus;1</subscript></highlight>, while optical multiplexer <highlight><bold>436</bold></highlight> is shown to process optical channels having wavelengths &lgr;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, &lgr;<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, . . . &lgr;<highlight><subscript>N</subscript></highlight>. It should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the particular wavelength assignments for the one or more optical multiplexers is a matter of design choice. For example, it may be desirable and practical for each optical multiplexer to handle a band of optical channels of adjacent wavelengths, e.g., &lgr;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, &lgr;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, . . . &lgr;<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>in optical multiplexer <highlight><bold>435</bold></highlight> and &lgr;<highlight><subscript>i&plus;1</subscript></highlight>, &lgr;<highlight><subscript>i&plus;2</subscript></highlight>, . . . &lgr;<highlight><subscript>N </subscript></highlight>in optical multiplexer <highlight><bold>436</bold></highlight>, and so on. Factors such as channel spacing, the total number of optical channels (N), and other considerations will dictate particular configurations and component selection for adding the optical channels. Other modifications to the particular scheme for adding optical channels, which are consistent with the teachings herein, will also be apparent to those skilled in the art and are contemplated by the teachings herein. For example, other components for combining optical channels may be used instead of optical multiplexers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Combiner <highlight><bold>437</bold></highlight> is used to combine the optical channels supplied by each of optical multiplexers <highlight><bold>435</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>436</bold></highlight>. By way of example, combiner <highlight><bold>437</bold></highlight> can be a 50/50 combiner that combines an equal amount of signal power from each of the multiplexed signals. Optical amplifier <highlight><bold>438</bold></highlight> is then used to amplify the optical channels supplied by combiner <highlight><bold>437</bold></highlight> and the amplified signal is then passed to wavelength blocker <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>, which operates in a similar manner as described in the preceding embodiments. For example, wavelength blocker <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> is configured or otherwise provisioned, e.g., via remote software-based control, to block those wavelengths corresponding to optical channels not being added at node <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> while passing the wavelengths of those optical channels being added at node <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight>. Wavelength blocker <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> provides an added benefit by minimizing amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) noise that may be generated by optical amplifier <highlight><bold>438</bold></highlight>. Again, wavelength blocker <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> may also include a dynamic gain equalization function (DGEF) to provide a per-channel gain equalization capability so that the power of the optical channels being added can be maintained at a level approximately equal to the average of the power of the optical channels in &ldquo;through&rdquo; path <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Combiner <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> can be used to combine the selected optical channels being added via &ldquo;add&rdquo; path <highlight><bold>431</bold></highlight> to the optical channels from &ldquo;through&rdquo; path <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight>. In one illustrative embodiment, a well-known 60/40 combiner can be used so that the combined signal comprises 60% of the power of the optical channels from &ldquo;through&rdquo; path <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight> and 40% of the power of the optical channels from &ldquo;add&rdquo; path <highlight><bold>431</bold></highlight>. As such, the &ldquo;through&rdquo; optical channels would be slightly favored in this particular scenario. The incorporation of amplification within node <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> and the selection of appropriate power splitting and combining ratios for the various taps, combiners, multiplexers, demultiplexers, and interleavers will of course be a matter of design choice based on factors such as loss budget and so on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The combined multi-wavelength signal is then routed via path <highlight><bold>451</bold></highlight> to interleaver <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> where it is interleaved with the multi-wavelength signal that comprises those optical channels expressly routed from path <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, e.g., optical channels having &lgr;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, &lgr;<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, . . . &lgr;<highlight><subscript>N&minus;1 </subscript></highlight>in this exemplary embodiment. The interleaved signal is then amplified (optionally) by optical amplifier <highlight><bold>449</bold></highlight> for transmission as WDM output signal <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> to the next node in the network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows another illustrative embodiment of an add/drop node <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> that provides 100% add/drop capability, optical amplification to compensate for losses, growth capability for add/drop, and interleaving to increase channel spacing between adjacent optical channels. The embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is similar in configuration and in operation to that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> with the exception that path <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> is used for dropping optical channels instead of express routing as is done in path <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. As such, only the differences between the embodiments shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference> will be discussed here for sake of brevity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> As shown, WDM input signal <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> is provided to an optional optical amplifier <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> which boosts the signal power of the optical signal. Again, incorporation of optical amplification is a matter of design choice. Interleaver <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> performs the same function as interleaver <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> in that the incoming WDM input signal <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> is de-interleaved into two output streams, optical channels having wavelengths &lgr;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, &lgr;<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, . . . &lgr;<highlight><subscript>N&minus;1 </subscript></highlight>in path <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> and optical channels having wavelengths &lgr;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, &lgr;<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, &lgr;<highlight><subscript>N </subscript></highlight>in path <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>. The processing of the optical channels in path <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> via optical amplifier <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight>, tap <highlight><bold>561</bold></highlight>, wavelength blocker/DGEF <highlight><bold>562</bold></highlight>, through path <highlight><bold>563</bold></highlight>, and combiner <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> is the same as that previously described for the optical channels in path <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> and will not be repeated here for sake of brevity. Similarly, optical amplifier <highlight><bold>565</bold></highlight>, interleaver <highlight><bold>566</bold></highlight>, and optical demultiplexers <highlight><bold>567</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>568</bold></highlight> perform the same &ldquo;drop&rdquo; functions while optical multiplexers <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>536</bold></highlight>, combiner <highlight><bold>537</bold></highlight>, optical amplifier <highlight><bold>538</bold></highlight>, and wavelength blocker <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> perform the same &ldquo;add&rdquo; functions as described for the corresponding components in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> For the optical channels in path <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, optical amplifiers <highlight><bold>509</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight>, tap <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, interleaver <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>, optical demultiplexers <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>, and wavelength blocker <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight> also perform the same &ldquo;drop&rdquo; functions as the corresponding components both in path <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> as well as those corresponding components in the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. By including the same drop capability in path <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, any of the optical channels in WDM input signal <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> can now be dropped at node <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight>. Interleaver <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight> is therefore used to interleave or otherwise combine the optical channels from &ldquo;through&rdquo; path <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight> (e.g., those not dropped via &ldquo;drop&rdquo; path <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>) with the optical channels combined in path <highlight><bold>551</bold></highlight> that are supplied from &ldquo;through&rdquo; path <highlight><bold>563</bold></highlight> (e.g., those not dropped via &ldquo;drop&rdquo; path <highlight><bold>564</bold></highlight>) and from &ldquo;add&rdquo; path <highlight><bold>531</bold></highlight>. The interleaved signal is then amplified by optical amplifier <highlight><bold>549</bold></highlight> and supplied as WDM output signal <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
