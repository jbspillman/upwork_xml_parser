<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A connector with a limited ampacity supplies a load which draws more current than the ampacity of the connector. A buck converter changes the power passing through the connector to a higher current at a lower voltage to energize the load. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="A-0002" lvl="0">Alternatively, if the load is intermittent, the current passing through the connector may charge a large capacitor which is able to supply a larger current to the intermittent load. The capacitor may also be used to power a continuous load, such as a memory, during failure of a power supply feeding the connector. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to power supplies for auxiliary devices located outside of a main device. More particularly, the invention relates to TV receivers which supply power to an external module. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In the past, the amount of current that a television receiver was able to provide to an external module was limited to about one ampere, because a connector which has an ampacity of more than one ampere tends to be bulky and expensive. As a result, external modules for use with television receivers have been limited to those drawing one ampere or less. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Ampacity is defined by the USA National Electrical Code as the current carrying capacity of electric conductors, expressed in amperes. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The instant invention allows a conventional connector to power a module requiring higher current than the ampacity of the connector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In a first embodiment of the invention, a power supply arrangement, for passing power through a connector having a limited ampacity, comprises a load having a predetermined voltage and amperage requirement. A power source having a voltage higher than the load requirement produces a current lower than the load requirement. A converter means converts the source of high voltage at low current to a lower voltage at a higher current. The output of the source is coupled through the connector to the input of the converter means. The output of the converter means is coupled to the load. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the invention, a power supply arrangement for passing power through a connector having a limited ampacity comprises an intermittent load having a predetermined voltage and amperage requirement. A power source has a voltage approximately equal to the predetermined voltage requirement and produces a current less than the amperage requirement. The power source is coupled through the connector to a capacitance. The intermittent load is coupled to the capacitance. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows an arrangement for energizing a load <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which is external to a television set <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The load <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> requires a high current, such as two amperes, which is beyond the capability of connector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, which has an ampacity rating of one ampere. The invention therefore provides a twelve volt supply <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, which provides twelve volts at one ampere. This is within the ampacity rating of connector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. A converter means, such as buck converter <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, converts the twelve volts at one ampere to five volts at two amperes, in order to energize load <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In this way, connector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, which has an ampacity rating of one ampere, is able to supply load <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, which draws two amperes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows another embodiment of the invention. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, TV set <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> contains a five volt power supply <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> which produces one ampere. However, intermittent load <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, which is external of the TV set, draws more than one ampere, such as in the range of two amperes. The invention provides a high value capacitance <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, such as a five farad Supercap, coupled across the supply for intermittent load <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Capacitance <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> may be charged by the current from power supply <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, which produces one ampere. However, since load <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is intermittent, it may draw a higher value of current from capacitance <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The embodiment of the invention shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> may be used to supply current to a continuous load, such as memory <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, through regulator <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>, in the event that there is a failure of power supply <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
