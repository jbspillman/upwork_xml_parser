<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a seat pad for outdoor furniture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> As is known, outdoor furniture such as chairs, settees, gliders and the like have been constructed to be of a cushion type or a non-cushion type. For example, outdoor chairs are known wherein a fabric or webbing is placed across a metal or wood frame in order to provide a seat and back surface to directly receive an occupant. Such constructions are of the non-cushion type and are designed with a particular seat geometry so that an occupant is seated comfortably. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Similar chairs also have been used with cushions to receive an occupant. Typically, the cushions are relatively thick and change the seating geometry of a chair by raising the level of the seat surface as well as changing the surface at which the back of the occupant is supported. Thus, these chairs are designed to compensate for the changes in geometry brought about by the cushions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It is an object of this invention to provide a seat pad for a chair of the non-cushioned type that does not change the seating geometry of the chair. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the invention to provide a seat pad for outdoor furniture of relatively thin construction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the invention to provide a contoured seat pad for a chair of relatively thin and generally rigid construction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the invention to provide a free-standing seat pad which is contoured to provide seat and back support surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Briefly, the invention is directed to a seat pad for outdoor furniture which is comprised of a pair of parallel spaced apart discrete bars, a fabric sleeve disposed over the bars and padding disposed in the sleeve between the bars to bias the bars laterally outwardly from each other and to stretch the sleeve into a flattened shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Each bar is of rigid stock material, such as aluminum, and is typically of rectangular cross section. In addition, each bar is contoured to complement the shape of the piece of furniture on which the pad is used. For example, each bar is formed with a horizontally disposed section and a vertically disposed section such that the fabric sleeve defines a flattened seat and a flattened back. Also, each of the horizontal and vertical sections of a bar may be contoured with a curved end and a rounded transition section may be disposed between the horizontal and vertical sections of the bar. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The seat pad is made as thin as possible to conform to a chair so as not to change the seating geometry of the chair. In this respect, the padding is made slightly thicker than the thickness of the rigid bars and is compressible to a slightly smaller thickness when seated upon it. Typically, the padding material is relatively dense, such as a densified polyester, in order to maintain the shape of the seat pad. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The seat pad further includes a plurality of rows of stitching across the sleeve in order to secure the front face of the sleeve to the back face as well as to the padding therebetween to stiffen the sleeve. The stitching is particularly located at the top area of the flattened back of the sleeve, the front area of the flattened seat of the sleeve and the transition area between the back and seat of the pad in order to aid the pad in conforming to the bends of a chair, particularly in the transition zone between the seat and back of a chair. The stitching also provides an aesthetic appearance to the seat pad. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The seat pad can be easily and quickly installed on a chair and secured in place using a single strap that, for example, envelopes the back of the chair. The strap also serves to hold the pad in place so that the pad conforms to and follows the contour of the chair. In a similar manner, the pad may be easily and quickly removed from a chair when desired.</paragraph>

</brief-description-of-drawings>
<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the chair <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is constructed for use as a non-cushion type chair and is provided in known manner with a frame <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, for example of aluminum, and a web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of fabric secured to and across frame <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to define a seat and a back. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, wherein like reference characters indicate like parts as above, a seat pad <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is placed on the chair <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to enhance the comfort of a seated occupant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the seat pad <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is formed of a sleeve <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of fabric material, a pair of discrete rigid bars <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> disposed on and in opposite sides of the sleeve <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and padding <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> within the sleeve <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and between the bars <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The sleeve <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is of any material suitable for use on outdoor furniture and is initially provided with an open lower end and a closed upper end. In addition, a strip of material <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is stitched or sewn at each of two diametrically opposite internal sides of the sleeve <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in order to define a pair of elongated pockets, each of which receives a rigid bar <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Each bar <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is made of a rigid stock material, such as aluminum, and is of flattened cross-section. For example, each bar <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is of a width of &frac34; inch and a thickness of {fraction (5/16)} inch. Further, each bar <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is contoured to have a horizontally disposed section <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and a vertically disposed section <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Each section <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is also contoured to have a curved end in order to complement the shape of the chair <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Each bar <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> also has an intermediate transition section <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> which is curved to match with the contour of chair <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> between the seat and back thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The padding <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is made of a densified material, such as a densified polyester, that is relatively dense to maintain the shape of the sleeve <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The padding <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be in the form of a flat sheet or web of material and is of a width to fit between the two rigid bars <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. In addition, the padding means <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has a sufficient resiliency to bias the rigid bars <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> laterally outwardly from each other in order to stretch the sleeve <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> into a flattened shape to define a flattened seat and a flattened back. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the seat pad <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> also includes a plurality of rows <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of stitching to secure the front face of a sleeve <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to the back face of the sleeve <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> as well as to the padding means <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> therebetween in order to stiffen the sleeve <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The rows <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of stitching are also placed to reinforce the seat pad <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> at the ends where the seat pad <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is contoured to match the contour of the chair <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as well as to provide an aesthetic appearance. Rows <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of stitching are also provided in the transition section between the front and back of the seat pad <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> for similar purposes. As illustrated, a pair of rows <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of stitching are disposed across a top area of the flattened back of the sleeve <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, three rows of stitching <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are provided across a bottom area of the flattened back and a pair of rows of stitching are disposed across a front area of the flattened seat of the sleeve <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In order to assemble the seat pad <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the padding <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is slid through the open end of the sleeve <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to completely fill the sleeve <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Next, a closure means, such as a zipper <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, disposed at the open end of the sleeve <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is manipulated to close the sleeve <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The pad is then sewed so that rows of stitching <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are made to secure the padding <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in place within the sleeve <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and to further rigidify the seat pad <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> where the rows of stitching <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are placed. The pad may then be stored until such time as it is necessary to insert the bars. For example, several pads may be stuffed, sewn and stored. Depending on the shape of the chair for which a seat pad is intended, the proper pair of bars for that chair is subsequently selected and inserted into the sleeve <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to complete the assembly process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In order to complete the assembly process, the sleeve <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is reopened at the bottom and a rigid bar <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is slid through the open end of the sleeve <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> into each pocket formed on either side of the sleeve <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by the strips <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The bars <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> thus shape the sleeve <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> into a horizontally disposed seat and a vertically disposed back. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> After fabrication, the seat pad <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> takes on a free-standing shape. That is to say, the rigid bars <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> define a seat and back while the padding <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> biases the bars <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> outwardly of each other so as to flatten the sleeve <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. As such, the free-standing seat pad <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may be readily placed on a chair as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> or may be stored. Several such pads <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may be stacked for storage purposes and/or transportation purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the back of the seat pad <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is provided with a strap <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> which is secured to the sleeve <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in an integral manner. The strap <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is made, for example, of a pair of strips <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, each of which is stitched at one end to the sleeve <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. In addition, one strip <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is provided with a buckle <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> while the other strip <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is provided with a layer of self-adhering material <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, such as a Velcro brand strip, for looping through the buckle <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and for securement to itself. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> After the seat pad <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> has been placed on the chair <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the strap <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is manipulated so that the strips <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> envelope the back of the chair <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to secure the seat pad <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in place. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The seat pad <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> has a thickness when free-standing of approximately 1 &frac34;&Prime; due to the thickness of the padding <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the double thickness of the sleeve <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. When a person sits on the pad <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the pad <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is compressed to a lesser thickness without changing the seating geometry of the chair <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. That is to say, the relative thinness of the seat pad <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> does not raise the occupant vertically any significant distance and does not position the back of the occupant away from the back of the chair <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Thus, the seat pad may be used with chairs that are designed to be of the non-cushion type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The seat pad <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may be purchased with a chair <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or may be sold separately for use on previously purchased chairs of the non-cushioned type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> pair of seat pads <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may be employed on a two seat settee <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, where a chair <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> has a different contour from that as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the seat pad <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime; is provided with rigid bars (not shown) which are contoured to the shape of the chair <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. For example, the ends of the rigid bars may have a flatter curvature for the chair shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> as compared with the chair of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The seat pads <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may be provided in various colors and patterns so that a user may select different colors and/or patterns to change the aesthetic appearance of a chair. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The invention thus provides a seat pad of relatively thin construction which can be used without changing the geometry of a chair or the like. Further, the invention provides a seat pad which is a free-standing structure that can be readily handled for placement on a chair to provide a cushioned seat and back as well as for storage. </paragraph>
