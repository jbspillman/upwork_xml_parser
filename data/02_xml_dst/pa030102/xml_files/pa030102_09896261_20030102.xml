<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A method of manufacturing a wear resistant shoe (<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>) includes upsetting (<highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>) one end portion (<highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>) of cylindrical member to work harden that portion to a substantial depth, machining (<highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>) the cylindrical member portion to finished dimensions and surface hardening (<highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>) a face (<highlight><bold>28 </bold></highlight>or <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>) of the machined cylindrical member portion. The cylindrical member may comprise rod stock of a diameter less than the greatest diameter of the finished shoe and be upset or swaged to axially reduce and radially increase the dimensions of the one end portion. A hollow region (<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>) is formed in an opposite rod stock end portion and the periphery (<highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>) of the hollow region is crimped about a rounded end (<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>) of the piston (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>). The cold work done during the swaging or forming process provides a foundation for hardened faces comprising balance (<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>) and auxiliary balance (<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>) lands, forms a crude shape of the shoe, and imparts work hardening and wear property improvements. The harder metal surface provides a foundation for subsequent surface hardening such as coating with TiN. The crimping process used to join the shoe to the piston imparts cold work to the skirt region of the shoe and enhances the wear resistance of the shoe. The cold heading step (<highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>) may be omitted if a hardened rod stock is used, but the skirt should be annealed (<highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>) prior to crimping to the piston. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a process of making a wear resistant shoe of the type frequently employed to engage a swash-plate or moving cam surface in a pump or similar device, and the product resulting from that process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It is a fairly common practice to harden machinery parts that are subject to substantial wear. For example, pumps (and analogous motors) sometimes employ a plurality of pistons that are sequentially actuated by a off-axis rotating cam surface called a swash plate. Each piston has a shoe which is fixed to the piston by a ball and socket joint and has wear resistant face which engages the swash plate. U.S. Pat. No. 5,728,475 illustrates a technique for hardening the wear surfaces of a shoe suitable for use in such a pump, motor or similar environment which is compatible with aircraft fuel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In this patented arrangement, the shoe is machined to a nearly final shape and then coated to provide a surface hardening. Thereafter, a skirt portion of the surface hardened shoe is annealed so that the skirt may be crimp attached to a rounded portion of the piston to form the ball and socket joint. This technique has met with good success, however, for more demanding applications, an improved wear couple may be required. In some applications, the boride surface hardening coating tended to crack, apparently because the hard thin boride coating was insufficiently supported by the soft basis metal. In addition, some operating conditions caused wear-through of the coating. The need to crimp the shoe to the piston head precludes the use of starting stock in the cold-reduced condition. The decreased ductility in this condition would result in greater chance of cracking during crimping. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is desirable to prevent cracking of the surface hardening and to increase the wear resistant properties of such a shoe. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a shoe with a work hardened foundation, a surface hardened face and a work hardened skirt forming the socket of the ball and socket joint. A cold heading process of cold working to form the cam engaging surfaces and a crimping process of cold working to join the piston and shoe are performed as separate process steps. If the entire cylinder blank from which the shoe is formed were cold worked, the crimping process would be difficult or impossible to perform without cracking. This process differs from U.S. Pat. No. 5,728,457 in that the hardening of the cam engaging surfaces ( a balance land and back flange) is achieved by cold heading as opposed to a thermal diffusion boriding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In general, and in one form of the invention, a wear resistant shoe is made by cold-heading one end portion of a generally cylindrical blank to radially increase and axially diminish the dimensions of the one end portion, and to work harden the one end portion while leaving an opposite end portion dimensionally unchanged. Subsequent cold-working and hardening of the opposite end portion is achieved while joining the shoe and piston during crimping of the skirt about a received piston rounded end. A hollow skirt is machined in the dimensionally unchanged portion prior to the subsequent cold-working. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Also in general, a wear resistant shoe is formed from hardened rod stock and assembled to a piston by first annealing one end portion of the machined rod stock and then forming a hollow region in the annealed rod stock end portion. Subsequent crimping of the periphery of the hollow region about a rounded end of the piston rehardens the annealed end. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> An advantage of the present invention is that a hardened region provides support for a surface hardened face to reducing fracturing of the surface hardened face. No Laves phase precipitation occurs; thus no post hardening thermal treatment is required. Cold heading of the shoe through hardens, as opposed to case hardening the upset material, thus simplifying grinding and lapping of the balance land and auxiliary balance lands. Wear resistance of the auxiliary balance land increases. A subsequent surface hardening, for example, a 2 micron thick titanium nitride coating, remains intact after testing under conditions that historically wore through the 25 micron thick boride coating and into the basis metal. Masking operations can be performed more simply by mechanical arrangements as opposed to the chemical means employed in former process. The harder substrate provides a superior base on which to support the wear resistant coating.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the drawings and particularly to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, there is shown a piston shoe <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of an axial piston pump or motor. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows the piston skirt portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> or flange open to receive the rounded end of piston <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, while <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows that portion crimped about the annular or rounded piston head <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The shoe <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a flat shoe wear surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that contacts a cam plate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. A back flange <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the shoe <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also wears against an auxiliary cam plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. In order for the piston shoe <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to operate within a fuel environment, the piston shoe <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> must be corrosion resistant, compatible with fuel, and provide the desired wear resistance. The piston shoe <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is made of a cold workable cobalt based alloy which is compatible with fuel and provides corrosion resistance. The wear surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which bears against the cam plate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the back flange <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which bears against the auxiliary cam plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are provided with a thermal diffusion boride treatment which provides the desired wear resistance. In order to restore sufficient ductility to flange <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the shoe <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> that will be cold worked, a solution treatment is performed to anneal that region at a temperature range of 2050.degree. to 2250.degree. F. in a non-oxidizing environment. The wear surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and back flange <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are maintained at a cooler temperature by engagement of the shoe <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with a heat sink such as a copper part, so that the coated surfaces do not lose their coating. The flange area <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the shoe <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is then cold worked by crimping in order to form the material to the round shape of the piston head <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The shoe <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and piston <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> are substantially as described in the abovementioned U.S. Pat. No. 5,728,475. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> wear resistant shoe <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> which may be used in place of the shoe <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> has a surface hardened flat annular balance land or face <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> for engaging a cam plate, a socket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for providing a pivotal coupling to a piston, and a work hardened foundation <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in the face region for providing rigid support for the surface hardened face <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Haynes 25 (AMS 5759) was originally selected for fuel motor and pump shoes on the basis of its cold workability, corrosion resistance and wear resistance and was used in the solution annealed bar form. The process of crimping the shoe <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to the piston gave rise to work hardening in the crimped region. This work hardening together with the inherent wear resistance of the Co based alloy gave rise to the requisite wear resistance at the piston to shoe interface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Comparing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, the annealed rod stock <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> from which the shoe is to be formed is shown in dotted lines and has two end portions <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. End <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is upset or cold-headed as indicated at <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to radially increase and axially diminish the dimensions of the one end portion. The cold-heading also serves to work harden the one end portion while the opposite end portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is dimensionally unchanged and remains in an unhardened state. Later end <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> will be cold-worked and hardened as indicated at <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. The cold-headed blank is machined as indicated at <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to form the final cross-hatched shape and final dimensions prior to the cold-working <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> to form a hollow skirt region <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> defined by the skirt or flange <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in end portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> for receiving a rounded end <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of a piston <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and to form the cam engaging wear resistant surfaces <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The skirt <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> should remain unhardened until it is hardened by crimping <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, however, enhanced hardness of the cam engaging surfaces <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may be achieved by masking the skirt region as at <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and surface hardening <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> the machined cam engaging surfaces, for example, by application of a TiN material to a thickness of approximately 2 micron. Later, the crimping <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> imparts an increased hardness to the cylindrical member close to the crimp. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Prior to cold heading, the soft rod stock is a cylindrical blank of an alloy of cobalt as shown by the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> outline surrounding the right hand portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the extended region <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> enclosed in the dotted lines. The rod stock has a diameter less than the greatest diameter of the finished shoe. Cold heading compresses the material axially and displaces the material in region <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> radially outwardly to form the work hardened foundation regions <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the peripherally outer portions of the hardened faces <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Process step <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> indicates this work hardening of portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of the cylindrical member to a substantial depth. Machining steps <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> remove excess material such as at <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and create a shoe of finished dimensions as indicated by the cross-hatched region of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> ready for masking and surface hardening of faces <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the machined cylindrical member portion as indicated at <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> To summarize <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, the starting basis metal in the annealed condition <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> with hardness generally less than 30 HRC is a right circular cylinder of single diameter greater than or equal to the non-crimped shoe skirt <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> diameter. This material is cold headed at <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to form a blank as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The larger diameter portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is upset by the cold head die by an amount sufficient to provide the desired hardening. The upset ratio (the amount of axial reduction divided by the original axial length of the portion to be upset) is generally in the range of 20-40%, with the higher amount preferred. The upset portion comprises the material making up the balance land <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the back flange <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. This upset portion comprises the material making up the balance land <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the back flange <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The non-upset portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> comprises the non-cold worked material making up the skirt <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The skirt is thus in a soft condition that can be crimped at <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> without cracking. After cold heading <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, the final, shoe geometry is machined from the blank. The balance land <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and back flange <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may subsequently be thermal diffusion borided and/or titanium nitride coated at <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> to further enhance the wear resistance. The shoe is then crimped at <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> onto the piston head, imparting cold work and wear resistance to the shoe skirt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates a modification of the process where substantially the same shoe <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is made starting with hardened rod stock <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. End <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is annealed at <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and remains in a soft condition until work hardening during the crimping step <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. The machining of both ends to the finished dimensions including forming the hollow region <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in the annealed rod stock end portion and machining the opposite end portion to form the cam engaging wear resistant surfaces is accomplished at <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. Note, the rod stock <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> must be of a diameter greater than or equal to the greatest diameter of the finished shoe since no cold-heading and radial enhancement occurs. Once machined, the skirt is masked at <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> to prevent surface hardening and the wear surfaces <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are surface hardened as before. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In both <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, the basis metal is Haynes 25 or L-605 (Co- 10Ni-20Cr&mdash;I5W-3Fe&mdash;O.IC-1Si-1.5 Mg-0.03P-0.02S). In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the starting basis metal <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is in the cold worked condition, with a hardness sufficient to provide the wear resistance or coating support desired. The shoe <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is machined from this work hardened material. The shoe is subsequently annealed at <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, for example, by placing it onto a copper heat sink of a type shown in the abovementioned U.S. Pat. No. 5,728,475. In the patent, such an arrangement is used to dissolve precipates deriving from a surface hardening coating, while here softening to a substantial depth is accomplished. A single induction coil may wrapped around the skirt and the skirt subsequently solution annealed by heating to 2150 deg. F. to 2250 deg. F. for 10 minutes in the case of a typical shoe. This anneals out the cold work in the skirt region making it possible to crimp the shoe to the piston without cracking. Longer times may be required for larger parts. The material comprising the back flange and the balance land is maintained by the heat sink at a temperature below 2150 deg. F. such that the cold work is retained. The balance land and back flange may subsequently be thermal diffusion borided and or titanium nitride coated to further enhance the wear resistance. The shoe is then crimped onto the piston head, imparting cold work and wear resistance to the shoe skirt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates the variations in hardness imparted by the cold-heading process <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. Material spills downwardly and outwardly so that the region <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is substantially work hardened. However, material in the conical regions <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> may, under some circumstances, receive little cold-working and remain unhardened. These conical regions constitute &ldquo;dead zones&rdquo; and zone <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> should be excluded from the finished balance land region. Also, zone <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> should not spill radially outwardly into the region of the auxiliary balance land <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The starting dimensions of the cylindrical blank should be selected to insure work hardening of the annular wear surface <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the foundation thereunder, as well as the surface <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. If L is the length of the original blank, the original cylindrical volume and post cold-heading volumes may be equated and solved to obtain L&equals;(A<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>E&plus;C<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>B)/A<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The upset U is the ratio of the height change to the initial height: U&equals;(L&minus;E&minus;B)/(L&minus;E). From the similar triangles illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the height B of the headed portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of the shoe prior to machining is B&equals;F/(G/2A&plus;&frac12;). For a selected upset ratio, these three equations may be solved simultaneously to determine L, U and B. This somewhat idealized analysis assumes the apexes of the dead zones are coincident and other simplifying assumptions. Also some allowances for machining material should be introduced. The results should be confirmed by experimentation with an actual shoe design. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In one example, the approximate hardness at the balance land <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> was 44 HRC and in the back flange <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, 45 HRC. The hardness at the apex of the shoe socket was 43 HRC. The hardness decreased to 36 HRC and finally 35 HRC at the midpoint and tip of the skirt respectively prior to crimping to a piston. </paragraph>
