<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to fuel cell systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A fuel cell can convert chemical energy to electrical energy by promoting a chemical reaction between two gases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> One type of fuel cell includes a cathode flow field plate, an anode flow field plate, a membrane electrode assembly disposed between the cathode flow field plate and the anode flow field plate, and two gas diffusion layers disposed between the cathode flow field plate and the anode flow field plate. A fuel cell can also include one or more coolant flow field plates disposed adjacent the exterior of the anode flow field plate and/or the exterior of the cathode flow field plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Each flow field plate has an inlet region, an outlet region and open-faced channels connecting the inlet region to the outlet region and providing a way for distributing the gases to the membrane electrode assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The membrane electrode assembly usually includes a solid electrolyte (e.g., a proton exchange membrane, commonly abbreviated as a PEM) between a first catalyst and a second catalyst. One gas diffusion layer is between the first catalyst and the anode flow field plate, and the other gas diffusion layer is between the second catalyst and the cathode flow field plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> During operation of the fuel cell, one of the gases (the anode gas) enters the anode flow field plate at the inlet region of the anode flow field plate and flows through the channels of the anode flow field plate toward the outlet region of the anode flow field plate. The other gas (the cathode gas) enters the cathode flow field plate at the inlet region of the cathode flow field plate and flows through the channels of the cathode flow field plate toward the cathode flow field plate outlet region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> As the anode gas flows through the channels of the anode flow field plate, the anode gas passes through the anode gas diffusion layer and interacts with the anode catalyst. Similarly, as the cathode gas flows through the channels of the cathode flow field plate, the cathode gas passes through the cathode gas diffusion layer and interacts with the cathode catalyst. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The anode catalyst interacts with the anode gas to catalyze the conversion of the anode gas to reaction intermediates. The reaction intermediates include ions and electrons. The cathode catalyst interacts with the cathode gas and the reaction intermediates to catalyze the conversion of the cathode gas to the chemical product of the fuel cell reaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The chemical product of the fuel cell reaction flows through a gas diffusion layer to the channels of a flow field plate (e.g., the cathode flow field plate). The chemical product then flows along the channels of the flow field plate toward the outlet region of the flow field plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The electrolyte provides a barrier to the flow of the electrons and gases from one side of the membrane electrode assembly to the other side of the membrane electrode assembly. However, the electrolyte allows ionic reaction intermediates to flow from the anode side of the membrane electrode assembly to the cathode side of the membrane electrode assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the ionic reaction intermediates can flow from the anode side of the membrane electrode assembly to the cathode side of the membrane electrode assembly without exiting the fuel cell. In contrast, the electrons flow from the anode side of the membrane electrode assembly to the cathode side of the membrane electrode assembly by electrically connecting an external load between the anode flow field plate and the cathode flow field plate. The external load allows the electrons to flow from the anode side of the membrane electrode assembly, through the anode flow field plate, through the load and to the cathode flow field plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Electrons are formed at the anode side of the membrane electrode assembly, indicating that the anode gas undergoes oxidation during the fuel cell reaction. Electrons are consumed at the cathode side of the membrane electrode assembly, indicating that the cathode gas undergoes reduction during the fuel cell reaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> For example, when hydrogen and oxygen are the gases used in a fuel cell, the hydrogen flows through the anode flow field plate and undergoes oxidation. The oxygen flows through the cathode flow field plate and undergoes reduction. The specific reactions that occur in the fuel cell are represented in equations 1-3. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> As shown in equation 1, the hydrogen is reacted to form protons (H<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>) and electrons. The protons flow through the electrolyte to the cathode side of the membrane electrode assembly, and the electrons flow from the anode side of the membrane electrode assembly to the cathode side of the membrane electrode assembly through the external load. As shown in equation 2, the electrons and protons react with the oxygen to form water. Equation 3 shows the overall fuel cell reaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In addition to forming chemical products, the fuel cell reaction produces heat. One or more coolant flow field plates are typically used to conduct the heat away from the fuel cell and prevent it from overheating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Each coolant flow field plate has an inlet region, an outlet region and channels that provide fluid communication between the coolant flow field plate inlet region and the coolant flow field plate outlet region. A coolant (e.g., liquid de-ionized water, or other non conducting fluid) at a relatively low temperature enters the coolant flow field plate at the inlet region, flows through the channels of the coolant flow field plate toward the outlet region of the coolant flow field plate, and exits the coolant flow field plate at the outlet region of the coolant flow field plate. As the coolant flows through the channels of the coolant flow field plate, the coolant absorbs heat formed in the fuel cell. When the coolant exits the coolant flow field plate, the heat absorbed by the coolant is removed from the fuel cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a fuel cell system <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> including a fuel cell assembly <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> having a plurality of fuel cells <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. Fuel cell system <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> also includes an anode gas supply <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, an anode gas inlet line <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, an anode gas outlet line <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, a cathode gas supply <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, a cathode gas inlet line <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, a cathode gas outlet line <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>, a coolant inlet line <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>, and a coolant outlet line <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> To increase the electrical energy available, the plurality of fuel cells <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> can be arranged in series, to form a fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>. For example, one side of a flow field plate functions as the anode flow field plate for one fuel cell while the opposite side of the flow field plate functions as the cathode flow field plate in another fuel cell. This arrangement may be referred to as a bipolar plate. The stack may also include plates such as, for example, an anode coolant flow field plate having one side that serves as an anode flow field plate and another side that serves as a coolant flow field plate, e.g., a monopolar plate. As an example, the open-faced coolant channels of an anode coolant flow field plate and a cathode coolant flow field plate may be mated to form collective coolant channels to cool the adjacent flow field plates forming fuel cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> is typically provided with inlets, outlets, and manifolds for directing the flow of reactants and coolant to the appropriate flow plates, and assembled between a pair of thick rigid end plates, which are also provided with inlets and outlets. The end plate that is used to deliver one or more reactants to an end of the fuel cell stack is sometimes called a service end plate <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). The end plate at the opposite end of the fuel cell stack is sometimes called a blind end plate <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). The edges of the two end plates are bolted together to apply a compressive force on the fuel cell stack. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a partial schematic representation of fuel cell system <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> in operation. Anode gas supply <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, e.g., a reformer, provides in parallel hydrogen gas via inlet line <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> to the anodes of cells <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through N, e.g., <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. At each cell, the anode converts the hydrogen into protons and electrons. The protons travel through the solid electrolyte and to the cathode of the respective cells. At cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the electrons flow toward an external load. At the other cells, the electrons flow to the cathode of an adjacent fuel cell, toward the external load. Unreacted anode gas flows through the cells of fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> through outlet <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Similarly, cathode gas supply <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, e.g., an air blower, provides in parallel oxygen (air) via inlet line <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> to the cathode of cells <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through N. At each cell, the cathode forms water from the oxygen, protons from the respective anode, and electrons flowing from the external load (cell N) or adjacent anode (cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through N&minus;1). The water can be removed from stack <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> by the cathode gas stream. After flowing through the cells, the oxygen flows out of fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> through outlet <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Thus, as the anode and cathode gases are supplied to fuel cell system <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, hydrogen and oxygen are converted into water, and electrons flow through the external load, thereby supplying electrical energy. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to fuel cell systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Without wishing to be bound to theory, it is believed that fuel cell stacks can be susceptible to loss of heat to the environment, e.g., due to radiative, convective, and/or conductive heat loss. As a result, during use, as relatively hot reactant(s) containing water passes through the fuel cell stack, and experiences a temperature drop, water from the reactant(s) can condense in the fuel cell stack. For example, hydrogen coming from a reformer can be relatively hot, e.g., about 65&deg; C., and water-saturated, to minimizing drying out of the solid electrolyte in the fuel cell stack. In some embodiments, water may be added to the reactant(s) in a separate step, e.g., pre-humidification. As it enters the fuel cell stack, the hydrogen can experience a temperature drop to, e.g., about 60&deg; C., and water can condense in the fuel cell stack. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As water condenses in the fuel cell stack, the water can block the flow channels and the solid electrolytes, and eventually flood the fuel cells in the stack. As fuel cells get blocked by water and flood, their voltages decrease, and overall performance of the fuel cell stack decreases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Condensation of water can be particularly problematic when the fuel cell system is operating at low power. During operation at low power, gas flow or pressure through the fuel cell stack is relatively low, and the amount of heat generated by the cathodes in the fuel cell stack is also relatively low. As a result, condensation of water can be relatively high. In comparison, when the fuel cell system is operating at high power, gas flow or pressure and the amount of heat generated are relatively high, both of which can minimize condensation of water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Moreover, condensation of water, which effectively reduces the water content in the humidified reactant(s), and can be comparable to operating the fuel cell system with sub-saturated reactants, can shorten the life of the solid electrolyte by drying out the solid electrolyte. This can reduce the electrical output and life of the fuel cell stack. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In certain embodiments, the invention features a method of operating a fuel cell system having a fuel cell stack and a plurality of fuel cells associated with the fuel cell stack. The method includes monitoring an operating parameter associated with the fuel cell stack, and adjusting a temperature of the fuel cell stack based on the operating parameter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The operating parameter can be, for example, a voltage of a fuel cell, a power output from the fuel cell system, or a temperature of a fuel cell associated with the fuel cell stack. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Adjusting the temperature can include adjusting coolant flow through the fuel cell stack. Adjusting coolant flow can include restricting and/or unrestricting coolant flow through the stack, e.g., as a function of time and/or to cause the operating parameter to be a predetermined level. The predetermined level can be within about 15% of an operating parameter under normal operation of the fuel cell system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The fuel cell system can further include a first end plate associated with a first end of the fuel cell stack, and the method can further include heating the first end plate. Heating the first end plate can include heating a first heating element different than the first end plate. The first heating element can be adjacent to the first end plate or be disposed between the first end plate and the fuel cell stack. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The method can further include flowing a fluid, e.g., a heated fluid, through a flow channel defined by the first end plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The method can further include heating, e.g., electrically, the first end plate with a heating element disposed on the first end plate, and/or heating a second end plate associated with the fuel cell stack. Heating the second end plate can include heating a second heating element different than the second end plate. The second heating element can be adjacent to the second end plate, e.g., between the second end plate and the fuel cell stack. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The method can be performed as a feedback loop. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention features a method of operating a fuel cell system having a fuel cell stack and a plurality of fuel cells associated with the fuel cell stack. The method includes monitoring voltages of a set of fuel cells, and restricting coolant flow through the fuel cell stack when one or more of the monitored voltages deviate from a predetermined voltage range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Embodiments include one or more of the following features. The method can be performed as a feedback loop. The set of fuel cells includes all the fuel cells associated with the fuel cell stack. Restricting coolant flow is performed when one or more of the monitored voltages deviate by more than about 10% from an operating voltage under normal operation of the fuel cell system. The method further includes unrestricting coolant flow through the fuel cell stack, e.g., when the monitored voltages are in the predetermined voltage range and/or after a predetermined time of restricting coolant flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The method can further include monitoring an operating parameter of the fuel cell system, e.g., a power output of the fuel cell system, a temperature of the fuel cell stack, or a temperature of a first heatable element, and adjusting a temperature of the first end plate based on the operating parameter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Adjusting the temperature can include heating a first heatable element and/or flowing a fluid through the first end plate. The heatable element can be adapted to heat an outer periphery of the fuel cell stack. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The method can further include adjusting a temperature of a second end plate associated with the fuel cell stack based on the operating parameter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Loss of heat can be particularly high at the peripheries of the fuel cell stack, such as at the ends of the stack, e.g., near the end plates. This loss of heat is believed to result in the temperature of the fuel cell stack being non-uniform along the length of the fuel cell stack, and the ends of the fuel cell stack not being maintained at a desired operating temperature of the fuel cell stack. That is, the temperature of the ends at the fuel cell stack, particularly near the end plates, can be relatively lower than the temperature at the center of the fuel cell stack. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> As a result, condensation of water can be particularly problematic for cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which is located at the end of the fuel cell stack where heat loss is relatively high. Cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is also adjacent to an already relatively cool service end plate (due to radiative heat loss). Furthermore, cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has a cathode, which is where heat is generated during operation, that faces away from service end plate <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, vis-a-vis adjacent to the service end plate. Thus, cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is not provided with heating that it may have, for example, if the cathode of cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> were adjacent to service end plate <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Consequently, cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be relatively cooler, e.g., 2-4&deg; C. cooler, than other cells in the fuel cell stack and be particularly susceptible to water condensation from water-containing, relatively hot reactant(s) passing through the inlets and outlets extending through service end plate <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In a situation sometimes called cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> tripping, as the flow channels and the solid electrolyte of cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> get blocked by water, and cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> floods, its voltage decreases, and overall performance of the fuel cell stack decreases. Meanwhile, cell <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> through cell N may continue to operate normally and to transfer electrons to the cathode of cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. As this continues, the polarity of the electrodes of cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> reverses from normal operating conditions, e.g., the cathode becomes negative, and/or the potential difference between the anode and the cathode of cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can increase to relatively high oxidizing potentials, such as greater than about 0.6 Volts, or greater than about 1.23 Volts above a Standard Hydrogen Electrode (SHE). At these potentials, the anode of cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can interact with water to produce protons, electrons and oxygen (H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O&rarr;2H<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>&plus;2e<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>&plus;&frac12;O<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>). The protons migrate toward the cathode of cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and the electrons migrate toward the external load, as in the normal fuel cell process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> However, the relatively high oxidizing potential and the evolution of oxygen at the anode of cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can oxidize and degrade materials in the fuel cell, such as, for example, certain catalysts (e.g., ruthenium), catalyst supports (e.g., carbon), and carbon in the gas diffusion layers. These oxidizing conditions can lead to irreversible damage to the electrodes and loss in fuel cell performance. Thus, cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can act as the limiting cell in the fuel cell stack. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Moreover, as discussed above, cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> tripping can be particularly problematic when the fuel cell system is operating at low power. At low power, gas flow and/or the amount of heat generated by the cathodes in the fuel cell stack can be relatively low, and condensation of water can be relatively high. </paragraph>

Condensation of water is, therefore, minimized, thereby minimizing cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> tripping. The fuel cell assembly can also be operated with saturated reactant(s), thereby minimizing drying out of the solid electrolyte. As a result, the performance and life of the fuel cell assembly can be enhanced. </paragraph>

Cell N is positioned adjacent to the service end plate, and the cathode of cell N is adjacent to the service end plate. In these embodiments, cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> adjacent to the blind end may experience tripping as described above, and one or more heatable elements may be used to minimize tripping. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a fuel cell system <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> including a fuel cell assembly having a fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> composed of a plurality of fuel cells <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, e.g., eighty-eight fuel cells arranged in series. Fuel cell system <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> also includes an anode gas supply <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>, an anode gas inlet line <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>, an anode gas outlet line <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, a cathode gas supply <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>, a cathode gas inlet line <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>, a cathode gas outlet line <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight>, a coolant inlet line <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight>, and a coolant outlet line <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>. System <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> further includes a controller <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> and a valve <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight> that provide a mechanism for managing water in fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, e.g., reduces condensed water in the stack to enhance performance of the stack. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Controller <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>, e.g., a computer or a microprocessor, is generally adapted to regulate the flow of coolant through fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, e.g., based on a detected performance parameter of the fuel cell stack. By regulating the flow of coolant through fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, e.g., by closing or opening valve <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight>, controller <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> can regulate, e.g., increase or decrease, the internal temperature of the stack. This, in turn, can provide a method of operating fuel cell system <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> such that condensation of water in stack <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> can be minimized or regulated to enhance performance of the stack. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> More specifically, condensed water in fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> can be removed and/or the amount of condensed water can be minimized by restricting, e.g., reducing or stopping, coolant flow through the stack. By restricting coolant flow through stack <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, and for example, keeping other operating parameters of the stack unchanged, the internal temperature of the stack typically increases because there is less coolant flowing through the stack. The dew points of fuel cell gases entering the stack, however, remain substantially unchanged. Since the internal temperature, or dry bulb temperature, of the stack has increased, the fuel cell gases now have increased water carrying capacities, compared to the same gases at a lower dry bulb temperature. The increased capacities allow the gases to effectively remove water condensed in the stack and/or to minimize water condensation in the stack with minimal disruptions to the operation of the fuel cell system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Generally, restricting coolant flow affects all the fuel cells <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> in stack <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> because the coolant flows through the entire stack. Water can be removed and/or condensation can be minimized from one fuel cell, any combination of fuel cells or all the fuel cells by regulating coolant flow through the coolant inlet line. It is believed that the degree of water removal is proportional to the amount of water condensed in a fuel cell. That is, the more condensed water a cell has, the more the cell responds to coolant flow restriction, thereby providing a self-selecting process in which the cell(s) that needs the most water removal benefits the most from coolant flow restriction. The cell(s) that are not flooded or that do not have substantial amounts of condensed water operate substantially unchanged during coolant flow restriction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> After a period of coolant flow restriction, coolant flow can then be resumed, e.g., unrestricted, at a predetermined time to allow the coolant to conduct heat away from fuel cells <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> and prevent stack <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> from overheating. Coolant flow can be resumed to its pre-restricted flow or to a different flow rate. Generally, coolant flow restriction should be monitored to minimize drying out the electrolyte and overheating of stack <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, in one embodiment, controller <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>, valve <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight>, and stack <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> operate in a feedback loop to control coolant flow to the stack. Controller <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> receives as inputs voltage measurements of fuel cells <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. The voltage of a cell can be indicative of its performance, e.g., flooded cells typically have decreased voltages compared to cells that are not flooded. In response to these inputs, controller <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> regulates coolant flow to stack <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> by adjusting valve <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight> located along coolant inlet line <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight>. This, in turn, regulates the dry bulb temperature of stack <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, as described above. As the amount of condensed water in the stack responds to changes in the dry bulb temperature, this response is reflected in the voltage measurements, which are fed back to controller <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> to regulate coolant flow accordingly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> For example, controller <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> can be configured, e.g., programmed, to monitor the operating voltages of fuel cells <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, e.g., the controller can detect eighty-eight voltage measurements from eighty-eight fuel cells in the stack. Under one operating condition, the fuel cells can be operating within an acceptable or desirable voltage range, for example, in the range of about 0.58 Volt to about 0.62 Volt per cell, with an average voltage (V<highlight><subscript>avg</subscript></highlight>) of about 0.60 Volt per cell. As one or more cells collect condensed water and/or flood, the performance of the cell(s) decreases, which is indicated by the voltage(s) of these cell(s) typically decreasing from the acceptable or desirable voltage range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> In one method of operation, controller <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> can be configured to restrict coolant flow when it detects, from one or more of the monitored fuel cells, a minimum voltage (V<highlight><subscript>min</subscript></highlight>) that deviates from the average voltage by a predetermined value, e.g., greater than about 15% or greater than about 20%. That is, using the example above where V<highlight><subscript>avg </subscript></highlight>is about 0.60 Volt, controller <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> can restrict coolant flow when it detects one or more V<highlight><subscript>min </subscript></highlight>of about 0.48 to about 0.51 Volt. In other embodiments, controller <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> can be configured to restrict coolant flow when it detects a minimum voltage, or a predetermined number of minimum voltages, equal to a predetermined voltage, which may not be a function of the operating voltage range or the average voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> As described above, as coolant flow is restricted, the dry bulb temperature of stack <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> increases. As a result, condensation of water is minimized, and/or condensed water is removed by fuel cell gases, which typically increases cell voltages, e.g., back to the desired operating voltage range. Thus, controlling coolant flow provides a mechanism for recovering, for example, flooded cell(s) back to a desired level of performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The changes in cell voltages are fed back to controller <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> to control coolant flow according to a desired method of operation, e.g., further restricting coolant flow until the desired voltages are achieved or reinitiating coolant flow. For example, coolant flow can then be reinitiated by controller <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> when the monitored voltages are all within a desirable operating range, e.g., about 0.58-0.62 Volt. Alternatively, or in addition, coolant flow can be reinitiated after a predetermined amount of time of restricted coolant flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> In other embodiments, controller <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> is configured to monitor other operating parameters, such as, for example, the power output of the stack or the temperatures of fuel cells <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, which can be indicative of possible water condensation. Fuel cell system <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> can be adapted to automatically or periodically restrict coolant flow, e.g., for a predetermined amount of time, during low power operation, when water condensation can be particularly problematic. Fuel cell system <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> can be adapted to restrict coolant flow according to a predetermined schedule, e.g., to purge the system of condensed water, with or without monitoring any operating parameters of the fuel cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> In other embodiments, other methods can be used to regulate coolant flow including, for example, changing the speed of a coolant pump or momentarily turning off the coolant pump. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments, fuel cell assembly <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> can be replaced with, or modified to include features from, fuel cell assemblies described below having one or more heatable peripheries, e.g., heatable end(s), to further provide fuel cell systems having enhanced management of water condensation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows a fuel cell assembly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> having a fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> compressed between a service heatable end plate <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and a blind heatable end plate <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. Heatable end plates <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> can be heated to inhibit condensation of water from humidified reactants passing through heatable end plate <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and/or to inhibit heat loss from the ends of fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of fuel cells <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and a plurality of cooling plates <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> interspersed between the plurality of fuel cells <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and through which a coolant is recirculated to maintain fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> at a generally constant operating temperature. Insulation layers <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>, and current collector/conductor plates <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, are disposed between respective end plates <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and the opposite ends of fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. A plurality of structural members such as elongated bolts <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and releasably attachable nuts <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> inhibit movement of end plate <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> away from end plate <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows an embodiment of a fuel cell <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Fuel cell <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes catalysts <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> (e.g., platinum) that facilitate fuel cell chemical reactions and are applied to the anode and cathode sides, respectively, of a solid polymer electrolyte <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, such as a solid polymer membrane or a proton exchange membrane (PEM) (e.g., a material available from E.I. Du Pont de Nemours Co. under the trademark NAFION&reg;). Anode and cathode gas diffusion layers <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, which are formed from a resilient and conductive material such as carbon fabric or carbon fiber paper, are disposed on catalysts <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Fuel cell <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> further includes a first fluid flow plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> having a fluid flow surface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> with a plurality of flow channels <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> defined thereon. Flow channels <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> receive and conduct a reactant through an inlet and out an outlet that are in fluid communication with and open onto corresponding passageways (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>), respectively, in fluid flow plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which form respective portions of manifolds (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) in fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). Fluid flow plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be monopolar or bipolar. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Flow channel <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> carries a reactant, e.g., a fuel such as hydrogen, as well as a liquid, e.g., for humidification. A second fluid flow plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>&prime;, is essentially similar to first fluid flow plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, includes flow channels <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>&prime; for carrying a reactant, e.g., an oxidant such as air/oxygen as well as a liquid, e.g., humidification and/or product water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Gaskets <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> are preferably used to seal the passageways forming the portions of the manifolds. Gaskets <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> may include a frame gasket made from a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) material manufactured by E. I. Du Pont de Nemours Company and sold under the trademark TEFLON&reg;. In other embodiments, multiple O-ring gaskets may be used. </paragraph>

Discharge opening <highlight><bold>169</bold></highlight> is suitably connected via a conduit to a heat exchanger used for cooling the coolant passing through the fuel cell stack, or alternatively, a separate heat exchanger. Similarly, a blind end plate may be configured to pass coolant from the outlet coolant manifold through the blind end plate. With this configuration of the end plate, the temperature of the coolant introduced into the end plates can closely approach the maximum operating temperature of the fuel cell stack, e.g., within a few degrees Celsius or within one degree Celsius, so that both the fuel cell stack and the end plates or the desired surfaces and/or portions of the end plates are maintained at substantially the same temperature as the fuel cell stack. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> In other embodiments, one or both end plates <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> may have separate inlet and outlet openings that connect to the flow channel in the end plates and that do not connect to the inlet or outlet coolant manifold of the fuel cell stack so that a separately-heated fluid may be used, e.g., a heated fluid which is not mixed with the coolant passing through the fuel cell stack. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> pair of plates <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> are disposed between insulation layers <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> and end plates <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> to provide a seal for flow channels <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>, respectively. In certain embodiments, suitable insulation layers may provide the necessary sealing of the outer portion of flow channel <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>, thereby eliminating the need for plates <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. Providing flow channels on the end plates and eliminating plates <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> result in a compact fuel cell assembly design, a reduction in manufacturing costs, and an efficient transfer of heat from the fluid, e.g., coolant and separately-heated fluid, to the end plate and to the ends of the fuel cell stack. End plate <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and end plate <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> can be formed from a metal, such as steel, or from a plastic, such as polypropylene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments, suitable insulation layers may be provided between the ends of the fuel cell stack and the end plates so that the operating temperature of the fuel cell stack is generally constant along its length and so that the at least one flow channel of the service end plate does not extend over the active or working area of the fuel cell. Instead, the flow channel extends around the inlet fuel opening and/or the inlet oxidant opening in the service end plate, and/or is disposed adjacent to the inlet fuel opening and/or the inlet oxidant opening in the service end plate to inhibit condensation of the humidified reactant conducted through the inlet fuel opening and/or inlet oxidant opening. </paragraph>

The flow channels may be configured as passageways extending through the body of the end plate, or a combination of flow channels on a surface and passageways extending through the body of the end plate. When coolant is used, the flow channel(s) and/or passageway(s) in the end plates are sized and configured so that desired flow is conducted through the end plates as well as the cooling plates interspersed between the fuel cells throughout the length of the fuel cell stack, e.g., so as to not short circuit the flow of coolant through the end plates. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> The plurality of heating elements <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> are suitably connected to an electrical power supply that is desirably connected to suitable heat sensors for controllably regulating the supply of electrical power to heating elements <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> to maintain end plate <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> or at least the surface of the end plate at the operating temperature of the fuel cell stack. The plurality of heating elements may include suitable electrical resistance heating tape applied to the surface of the end plate corresponding to the active or working area of the fuel cell and/or around one or more of the inlet reactant openings. Similarly, a blind end plate may include a plurality of heating elements extending along the surface of the end plate corresponding to the active or working area of the fuel cell stack.

<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> show an embodiment of heatable current collector plate <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. Generally, collector plate <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is configured to substantially correspond to the active area of fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, similar to the flow channels described above. Heatable collector plate <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> includes a collector body <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> defining a negative electrical contact <highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight>, a resistive thermal device (RTD) <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight>, and a temperature sensor assembly <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight>. Collector body <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> is made of a solid, thermally conductive material, such as gold-coated copper, that can tolerate the relatively hot and humid conditions inside a fuel cell assembly. Collector body <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> can be attached to a connector bracket <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>), which is used to mount portions of resistive thermal device <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> and sensor assembly <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight>, described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Resistive thermal device <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> is attached to collector body <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> to heat collector plate <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and, therefore, end plate <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> and entering gases. Device <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> includes a resistive heater attached to a wire and plug assembly <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> that can be mounted on connector bracket <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>). The resistive heater can be, for example, a flexible Kapton&reg; polyimide sheet having resistive heating elements or wires embedded therein, such as those commercially available from Minco Products, Inc. (Minneapolis, Minn.). Wire and plug assembly <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> is interfaced with a power source that is interfaced with a controller, e.g., a computer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Temperature sensor assembly <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> is used to detect the temperature of collector plate <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. Sensor assembly <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> includes a sensor <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight>, e.g., a thermocouple, attached to a wire and plug assembly <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight>. Sensor <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> is attached to collector body <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>, preferably relatively close to resistive thermal device <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> to provide an accurate temperature reading of collector plate <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. Wire and plug assembly <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> mounts to connector bracket <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> and is interfaced with the controller. Temperature sensor assembly <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> is also commercially available from Minco Products, Inc. (Minneapolis, Minn.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> In operation, temperature sensor assembly <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> provides an input of the temperature of collector plate <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> to the controller. In response to a detected temperature input from sensor assembly <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight>, the controller controls the power source to provide power to resistive temperature device <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> as needed to maintain collector plate <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> at a predetermined temperature, e.g., about 64&deg; C., thereby heating end plate <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> and entering saturated fuel and/or oxidant gases and minimizing condensation of water on cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> In other embodiments, fuel cell assembly <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can include any of the embodiments of heatable end plates described above, e.g., end plates <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. For example, blind end plate <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and/or service end plate <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> can define one or more flow channels and/or include heating element(s) <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> In certain embodiments, the fuel cell systems described above may include one or more sensors interfaced to detect one or more operating parameters of the fuel cell system. The detected parameter(s) may be inputted to the controller, which can then control heating of the end plate(s) and/or collector plate(s) according to a predetermined operation, e.g., as in a continuous or intermittent feedback loop. For example, the sensor(s) can be configured to detect parameters such as temperature of the fuel cell stack, temperature of the end plate(s), flow of reactant(s), pressure of reactant(s), power output, and water condensation levels. The controller can adjust heating of the end plate(s) and/or collector plate(s) to operate within predetermined conditions, e.g., more heating at low power output. In certain embodiments, the detected parameters may be used to manually adjust heating of the end plate(s) and/or collector plate(s). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments, cell N of a fuel cell stack may not experience the same degree of heat loss that cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may experience. The heat-generating cathode of cell N is adjacent to the blind end plate to provide heating at the blind end of the fuel cell stack. Also, the mass consumption of gases on the cathode (which can be about twice that of the anode side) is relatively high to help transport condensed water away. As a result, cell N may not experience a cell tripping problem. Nevertheless, fuel cell assembly <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may include a heatable blind collector plate <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, generally as described above for heatable collector plate <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. A heatable blind collector plate may be used with or without a heatable blind end plate, and with or without a heatable service collector plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> A heatable end plate can be located between a fuel cell stack and a heatable service collector plate <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> or a heatable blind collector plate. Heatable elements, e.g., heatable collector plates, can be positioned adjacent one or more sides, with or without heatable elements adjacent to the top and/or bottom ends, of a fuel cell stack to minimize heat loss and fluid condensation. Thus, heatable elements may be used to heat any and all combinations of outer peripheries defined by the fuel cell stack. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> A fuel cell assembly may include multiple heatable service collector plates and/or multiple heatable blind collector plates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> While the heatable collector plates described above are resistively heated, other methods of heating can be used, such as chemical heating, other methods of electrical heating, using reflective materials, magnetic heating, mechanical heating, and electromagnetic heating. </paragraph>
