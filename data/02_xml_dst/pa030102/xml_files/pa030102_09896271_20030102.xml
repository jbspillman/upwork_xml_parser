<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to electrical systems and, more specifically, to keypads for mobile communication devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Manufactures are continuously developing mobile communication devices that are smaller and smaller. Accordingly, there is a need to minimize the size of these keypads. This is particularly the case given that it is becoming desirable to have as large a display as possible given the current trend of using such devices for retrieving data and graphical information from the Internet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> For such small keypads, an important factor is the ease with which the keypad may be used by a user and the size of the footprint on the surface of the device. Keypads for mobile telephones generally have a, basic, configuration as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Keys which are used in dialing numbers, as well as for other purposes, are typically provided in a 4 by 3 matrix having a first row of numerals &ldquo;1&rdquo;, &ldquo;2&rdquo;, and &ldquo;3&rdquo;, a second row of numerals &ldquo;4&rdquo;, &ldquo;5&rdquo;, and &ldquo;6&rdquo;, a third row of numerals &ldquo;7&rdquo;, &ldquo;8&rdquo;, and &ldquo;9&rdquo; and a fourth row having a first character/function key, numeral &ldquo;0&rdquo;, and a second character/function key. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> One approach that manufacturers have taken is to reduce the size of each of the individual keys in the keypad, thereby reducing the size or the overall footprint of the keypad. However, there is a limit to the reduction in the size of the keypad. If the keypad is made too small, then it is difficult for the user to press the desired key without also accidentally pressing the neighboring keys. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Another arrangement of keys, which is usually located above this arrangement, is used to carry out other functions, such as initiating and terminating telephone calls and navigating around the screen and various menus of the mobile telephone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> One disadvantage is that typical keypads take up a larger surface area of the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Therefore, what is needed is a keypad that is compact with a relatively small footprint. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A keypad device is provided that is relatively compact and can be used easily by the user. A mobile telephone includes a body, a display, and a keypad. The keypad is removably secured to the body and coupled to a processor. The keypad is depressible along a plurality of directions and can be switched between a first mode and second mode, wherein each combination of depressible direction and mode represent a unique group of alphanumeric letters. The processor includes word recognition software, such a desire word can be determined form the sequence of groups of letter selected without having to select each individual letter.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2 a</cross-reference> mobile terminal <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a body <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a display <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a keypad <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, an on/off button <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, a speaker <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and a microphone <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The display <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has a non-unity aspect ratio. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the keypad <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is fixed relative to the body and in another embodiment the keypad <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be moved relative to the body <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by a motor drive or manually. Additionally, the keypad <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be removable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The keypad <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is a depressible keypad with sensors located under the keypad <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, each sensor being positioned 90 degrees apart along the vertical and horizontal axis <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, respectively. Additionally, the keypad <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> includes a centrally located sensor. The central sensor is activated when the keypad <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is pressed directly downward and allows the keypad <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to toggle between a first mode and second mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The numeral keys <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> can be provided as a part of the keypad <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> or adjacent to the keypad <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> one another circular ring in a circular arrangement, such that neighboring numeral keys are in numerical order, or in a matrix type arrangement. The numeral keys can be arranged in an annulus, and the annulus may be rotated. In the embodiment with the annulus and the keypad <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the annulus and the keypad <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be keyed together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the keypad <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be used to select alpha-letter. The letters are divided into eight groups. For example, the letters &ldquo;a&rdquo;, &ldquo;b&rdquo;, and &ldquo;c&rdquo; are located in the first position of the first mode along the axis <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The letters &ldquo;d&rdquo;, &ldquo;e&rdquo;, and &ldquo;f&rdquo; are located in the first position of the second mode along the axis <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The keypad <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is switched from the first mode to the second mode by pressing the keypad <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> vertically. The selection of letters applies to selecting any desired letter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The keypad <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, as indicated above, is located above a plurality of sensors. Thus, as the keypad <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is pressed in any direction, the sensors can determine the desired direction and, hence, the corresponding groups of letters depending on the mode of the keypad <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The sensors located under the keypad <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are coupled to internal circuitry. The circuitry includes a processor having word recognition software such that when a certain sequence of letters are entered the processor is able to determine the intended word and complete the action. Thus, if the letter &ldquo;c&rdquo; is the desired first selection, then the user would select the first mode and then press in the upper portion of the keypad <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> along the axis <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The user would not be required to press the key pad three times as with typical prior art devices, in order to toggle through the letter &ldquo;a&rdquo; and &ldquo;b&rdquo; to get to the letter &ldquo;c&rdquo; and select that letter. As other groups of letters are selected, the processor can determine, based on the other letters, that the letter &ldquo;c&rdquo; was the intended letter for first selection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The mobile terminal <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is provided with locking means that locks out the keypad <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, such that pressing the keypad <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> or any of the other input keys does not result in a selection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, the grouping of the letters in the first mode and the grouping of the letters in the second mode are shown along with the process of switching between the modes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the sequence needed to write the phrase &ldquo;HELLO MY FRIEND&rdquo; is set forth based on the legend shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>. As evident from the sequence of entries, only the group of letters needs to be selected because the processor is capable of determining the intended word based on the selected sequence of groups. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Although reference is made to key-presses and pressing of keys, it is to be understood that an electrical device according to the invention may receive input by pressing of keys or by some other means. Furthermore, the foregoing description relates to a mobile terminal such as a mobile telephone, and it is understood that the invention can be applied to other devices such as computers, personal digital assistants, and entry terminals for inputting data or access codes, for example to gain access to a building or to another secure location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Particular implementations and embodiments of the invention have been described. It is clear to a person skilled in the art that the invention is not restricted to details of the embodiments presented above, but that it can be implemented in other embodiments using equivalent means without deviating from the characteristics of the invention. </paragraph>
