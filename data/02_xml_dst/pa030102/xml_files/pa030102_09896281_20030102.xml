<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention pertains to multi-site ventricular pacing systems, and particularly Bi-Ventricular and AV synchronous cardiac pacing systems that pace and sense in at least one atrial heart chamber and deliver ventricular pacing pulses to right ventricular (RV) and left ventricular (LV) sites separated by a V-V delay for treatment of heart failure, and particularly to measuring QRS duration as a heart failure parameter and optimizing the AV delay and/or V-V delay to enhance ventricular filling and cardiac output as a function of QRS duration. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Congestive heart failure (CHF) is defined generally as the inability of the heart to deliver enough blood, i.e., to supply sufficient cardiac output, to the peripheral tissues to meet metabolic demands. Frequently CBF is manifested by left ventricular dysfunction (LVD), but it can have a variety of sources. For example, CHF patients may have any one of several different conduction defects. The natural electrical activation system through the heart involves sequential events starting with the sino-atrial (SA) node, and continuing through the atrial conduction pathways of Bachmann&apos;s bundle and intemodal tracts at the atrial level, followed by the atrio-ventricular (AV) node, Common Bundle of His, right and left bundle branches, and final distribution to the distal myocardial terminals via the Purkinje fiber network. A common type of intra-atrial conduction defect is known as intra-atrial block (IAB), a condition where the atrial activation is delayed in getting from the right atrium to the left atrium. In left bundle branch block (LBBB) and right bundle branch block (RBBB), the activation signals are not conducted in a normal fashion along the right or left bundle branches respectively. Thus, in a patient with bundle branch block, the activation of the ventricle is slowed, and the QRS is seen to widen due to the increased time for the activation to traverse the conduction path. For example, in a patient with LBBB, the delay in the excitation from the RV to the LV can be as high as 120 to 150 ms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In diseased hearts exhibiting LVD and CHF, cardiac depolarizations that naturally occur in one upper or lower heart chamber are not conducted in a timely fashion either within the heart chamber or to the other upper or lower heart chamber. In such cases, the right and left heart chambers do not contract in optimum synchrony with each other, and cardiac output suffers due to the conduction defects. In addition, spontaneous depolarizations of the left atrium or left ventricle occur at ectopic foci in these left heart chambers, and the natural activation sequence is grossly disturbed. In such cases, cardiac output deteriorates because the contractions of the right and left heart chambers are not synchronized sufficiently to eject blood therefrom. Furthermore, significant conduction disturbances between the right and left atria can result in left atrial flutter or fibrillation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> More particularly, as described in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 6,129,744, LVD and other forms of heart failure are manifested by reduced ejection fraction from the left ventricle thereby reducing stroke volume and pulmonary edema limiting the patient&apos;s ability to exercise. Patients suffering from LVD are also known to have elevated levels of catecholamines at rest because the body is attempting to increase cardiac output that induce a higher resting heart rate. In addition, the QT interval for such a patient is affected by the catecholamine level and thus has a changed pattern during exercise as well. These patients have a decreased QT response, or smaller change in QT, during exercise, such that the QT interval shortening during exercise is smaller than that found normally. Although QT interval is influenced independently by heart rate alone, as well as by exercise and catecholemines, it is not known to what extent each of these factors or both are responsible for the changed QT response to exercise in LVD patients. However, it is known that patients suffering LVD clearly have a different pattern of QT interval shortening during exercise. Moreover, the changed conductive patterns or a heart in heart failure are manifested by other changes in the PQRST waveforms, particularly an abnormally wide or long duration of the ventricular depolarization signal, or QRS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It has been proposed that various conduction disturbances involving both bradycardia and tachycardia of a heart chamber could benefit from pacing pulses applied at multiple electrode sites positioned in or about a single heart chamber or in the right and left heart chambers in synchrony with a depolarization which has been sensed at least one of the electrode sites. It is believed that atrial and left ventricular cardiac output can be significantly improved when left and right chamber synchrony is restored, particularly in patients suffering from dilated cardiomyopathy, LVD and CHF. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A number of proposals have been advanced for providing pacing therapies to alleviate heart failure conditions and restore synchronous depolarization and contraction of a single heart chamber or right and left, upper and lower, heart chambers as described in detail in the above referenced &apos;744 patent and in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,403,356, 5,797,970, 5,902,324, and 6,070,100 and in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,720,768 and 5,792,203. The proposals appearing in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,937,226, 4,088,140, 4,548,203, 4,458,677, 4,332,259 are summarized in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,928,688 and 5,674,259. The advantages of providing sensing at pace/sense electrodes located in both the right and left heart chambers is addressed in the &apos;688 and &apos;259 patents, as well as in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,354,497, 5,174,289, 5,267,560, 5,514,161, and 5,584,867. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The medical literature also discloses a number of approaches of providing bi-atrial and/or bi-ventricular pacing as set forth in: Daubert et al., &ldquo;Permanent Dual Atrium Pacing in Major Intra-atrial Conduction Blocks: A Four Years Experience&rdquo;, <highlight><italic>PACE </italic></highlight>(Vol. <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, Part II, NASPE Abstract 141, p.885, April 1993); Daubert et al., &ldquo;Permanent Left Ventricular Pacing With Transvenous Leads Inserted Into The Coronary Veins&rdquo;, <highlight><italic>PACE </italic></highlight>(Vol. <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, Part II, pp. 239-245, January 1998); Cazeau et al., &ldquo;Four Chamber Pacing in Dilated Cardiomyopathy&rdquo;, <highlight><italic>PACE </italic></highlight>(Vol. 17, Part II, pp. 1974-1979, November 1994); and Daubert et al., &ldquo;Renewal of Permanent Left Atrial Pacing via the Coronary Sinus&rdquo;, <highlight><italic>PACE </italic></highlight>(Vol. 15, Part II, NASPE Abstract 255, p. 572, April 1992). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In the above-referenced &apos;324 patent, an AV synchronous pacing system is disclosed providing three or four heart chamber pacing through pace/sense electrodes located in or adjacent one or both of the right and left atrial heart chambers and in or adjacent to the right and left ventricular heart chambers. During an AV delay and during a V-A escape interval, a non-refractory ventricular sense event detected at either the right or left ventricular pace/sense electrodes starts a conduction delay window (CDW) timer. A ventricular pace pulse is delivered to the other of the left or right ventricular pace/sense electrodes at the time-out of the CDW if a ventricular sense event is not detected at that site while the CDW times out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The above-referenced &apos;744 patent discloses a rate responsive, bi-ventricular pacemaker having one or more sensors for sensing a parameter indicative of the physiologic need for cardiac output, and for pacing the patient on demand between a lower rate limit (LRL) and an upper rate limit (URL). In a specific embodiment, the pacemaker determines QT interval, and stores data representative of changes in QT interval as a function of paced heart rate and/or the patient&apos;s spontaneous lower rate when at rest. Variations in the correlation of QT interval and heart rate, and/or variations in patient lower rate at rest are processed to provide a time trend, or profile, from which a determination is made as to whether or not LVD is indicated. In alternate embodiments, other data derived from cardiac signals is processed and stored, e.g., QRS duration, T-wave amplitude, etc. A change in the variation of T-wave amplitude with respect to exercise, and consequent heart rate, can be easily measured and tracked in a QT rate responsive pacemaker, or any pacemaker adapted to sense and recover the T-waves. Likewise, as noted above, changes in QRS duration (width) and/or morphology may also be detected and tracked for detection of a trend. Trends in this data are periodically evaluated, e.g., on a daily basis, and stored for downloading to an external programmer for deriving an indication of LVD, or onset or progression of LVD or for automatic initiation of a treatment response signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In the &apos;744 patent, an algorithm for automatically adjusting the rate responsive parameters, i.e., the correlation function between QT and desired rate is suitably performed on a daily basis. The pacemaker measures a slope of the correlation function at the LRL, and adjusts the QT-rate function between LRL and URL accordingly as disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 4,972,834. If such changes are stored and analyzed for a trend, progress toward LVD can be indicated. Likewise, if it is found that the patient heart rate is not dropped to the programmed LRL during nighttime, such that the spontaneous lower rate has had an upward progression, this trend can also be used as an indicator of the onset of LVD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> As asserted in the &apos;744 patent, these functions can be performed in an implanted monitor solely dedicated to detection and storage of cardiac data and processing of such data to provide an indication of LVD when interrogated. In a more preferred embodiment, a rate responsive pacemaker system is disclosed that can pace and sense in any combination or all of the four cardiac chambers. The treatment response upon an indication of onset of LVD has a number of embodiments, including changing the rate response function; changing physiologic sensor blending for dual or plural sensor rate responsive pacemakers; initiating three or four chamber pacing to achieve improved left heart response, e.g., synchronous ventricular pacing and/or other multi-chamber sequential pacing; and providing for a measured release of an appropriate drug for treating the LVD. In yet another disclosed embodiment, the pacemaker is implanted with software for carrying out normal dual chamber pacing, but the software can be upgraded by programmer downloading to provide different pacing functions, or to function as a three or four chamber pacemaker, along with utilization of an additional lead or leads for delivering stimulus pulses to the left heart chambers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 5,749,906, a dual chamber pacing system, is disclosed that continually adjusts the AV delay so as to maintain optimal ventricular pacing for therapy of patients having cardiomyopathy. The QRS duration of paced ventricular events is monitored, and analyzed to determine if the paced ventricular event is a fusion beat with an intrinsic ventricular depolarization. If fusion beat frequency criteria established for the patient are met, then the AV delay is shortened incrementally so that the ventricular pace pulse is delivered earlier, and fewer fusion beats occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Chronically collected data from patients with progressive LVD or other types of heart failure is needed so that the treating cardiologist can properly and accurately chart the progression, determine the nature of the heart failure, and be able to implement the optimal treatment in a timely fashion. There is also a substantial need in the art for a pacemaker or other implantable medical device (IMD) incorporating three or four channel pacing having the capacity to optimize the AV delay and the V-V pacing delay for pacing the RV and LV to treat the changing patient condition. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In view of the above need, the present invention provides a system and method for monitoring patient cardiac signals and processing such signals within IMD to provide data from which the onset or progression of heart failure can be determined, particularly the QRS duration as measured during a paced depolarization of the heart, and optimizing synchronous pacing delay parameters to minimize the measured QRS duration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The present invention is implemented in a wide variety of ways. In the broadest context, the present invention pertains to cardiac pacing systems that pace or sense ventricular events (V-EVENT) at or deliver a first ventricular pace (V-PACE<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) pulse to a first ventricular site and deliver a ventricular pace (V-PACE<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) pulse to a second ventricular site spaced from the first ventricular site after a V-V delay from the V-EVENT or V-PACE<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. A measurement of the cardiac depolarization QRS duration is initiated upon delivery of the V-PACE<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The QRS duration can be retained in IMD memory for retrieval and analysis at a later time or transmitted to a remote external medical device in real time. A series of QRS duration times can be measured and processed to determine maximum, minimum and average QRS duration that are stored in memory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The QRS duration is preferably measured from a selected pair of sense electrodes located remote from the first and second ventricular sites. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The present invention is preferably implemented in a bi-ventricular pacing system wherein the first ventricular site is one of an RV site or an LV site and the second ventricular site is the other of the RV or LV site, whereby pacing pulses V-PACE<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and V-PACE<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are delivered in the RV-LV sequence or the LV-RV sequence. The V-PACE<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be delivered either upon the time-out of a pacing escape interval or upon the V-EVENT occurring prior to time-out of the escape interval. The QRS duration can be measured from the V-PACE<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> pulse following time-out of the V-V delay timed from a V-EVENT (a VS marker), a V-PACE<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> delivered upon a V-EVENT (a VS/VP marker) or a V-PACE<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (a VP marker). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The present invention is also preferably implemented in a three or four chamber pacing system wherein pacing and sensing at one or both of an RA site and an LA site are provided. Bi-ventricular pacing in the LV and RV is provided, wherein V-PACE<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may be delivered to one of the LV site or RV site after time-out of a SAV delay from an atrial event (A-EVENT) sensed at one of the RA or LA sites or a PAV delay an atrial pace pulse delivered to one of the RA or LA sites. V-PACE<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is delivered to the other of the LV site or RV site after time-out of the V-V delay. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, this invention provides a system and method for monitoring the QRS duration, processing such signals to provide data from which the onset or progression of heart failure is determined, and adjusting synchronous pacing delay parameters including SAV delay and/or PAV delay and/or V-V delay to enhance cardiac output as a function of QRS duration. The SAV delay and/or the PAV delay and/or the V-V delay can be varied from the prevailing delays as a function of measured QRS duration so as to minimize the width of the QRS complex. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, the optimal V-V delay and optionally the optimal PAV delay or SAV delay or the combination of the same that minimizes the measured QRS duration and maximizes mechanical heart performance is determined. In one variation of this aspect of the invention, the SAV delay and/or PAV delay and/or V-V delay providing the minimum QRS duration is derived by successively applying incremented or decremented ones of the SAV delay, PAV delay and/or V-V delay, deriving a QRS_DUR<highlight><subscript>SAMPLE </subscript></highlight>value at each adjusted delay, comparing the set of N derived QRS_DUR<highlight><subscript>SAMPLE </subscript></highlight>values to determine the minimum QRS_DUR<highlight><subscript>SAMPLE </subscript></highlight>value, and setting the SAV delay, PAV delay and/or V-V delay to the SAV delay, PAV delay and/or V-V delay that provides the minimum QRS<highlight><subscript>13 </subscript></highlight>DUR<highlight><subscript>SAMPLE </subscript></highlight>value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Another manner of determining the values of the SAV delay, PAV delay, and/or V-V delay that provide a minimal QRS duration (QRS<highlight><subscript>13 </subscript></highlight>DUR<highlight><subscript>MIN</subscript></highlight>) following delivery of the V-PACE<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> involves measuring the QRS<highlight><subscript>13 </subscript></highlight>DUR<highlight><subscript>SAMPLE </subscript></highlight>values after a change in one or more of the V-V delay, SAV delay, and PAV delay are compared with the preceding or prior measured QRS<highlight><subscript>13 </subscript></highlight>DUR<highlight><subscript>SAMPLE </subscript></highlight>value to determine if the change has decreased the QRS duration. An additional change in the same direction (increasing or decreasing the parameter duration) is made if the prior change does decrease the QRS duration. But, if the change results in an increase in the measured QRS duration, then the change direction is reversed to repeat the measurement of the QRS duration using the prior parameter value. A rest period of a number of heart cycles or a time period is provided between each change in a V-V delay, SAV delay, and PAV delay parameter value to allow the heart to acclimate to the change. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> These methods can be first practiced by the physician in the initial post-implant telemetry session to derive and store in IMD memory the SAV delay, PAV delay and/or V-V delay that affords the shortest QRS duration that is also retained in memory as the QRS DURRF value. The methods are then performed at a programmed time of day preferably when the patient is at rest and the patient&apos;s heart rate is low and stable. The derived SAV delay, PAV delay and/or V-V delay that affords the shortest QRS duration are then employed until the next programmed time of day or other event criteria are met. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> This summary of the invention has been presented here simply to point out some of the ways that the invention overcomes difficulties presented in the prior art and to distinguish the invention from the prior art and is not intended to operate in any manner as a limitation on the interpretation of claims that are presented initially in the patent application and that are ultimately granted. </paragraph>

This embodiment of the invention is programmable to operate as a three or four chamber pacing system having an AV synchronous operating mode for restoring upper and lower heart chamber synchronization and right and left atrial and/or ventricular chamber depolarization synchrony. Of course, the present invention may also be practiced in a simpler, three-chamber pacing system eliminating certain of the features of the preferred embodiment described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> It should be appreciated that the present invention may be utilized particularly to treat patients suffering various forms of heart failure with or without bradycardia. The pacing system of the present invention can also be incorporated into an anti-tachyarrhythmia system including specific high rate pacing and cardioversion shock therapies for providing staged therapies to treat a diagnosed tachyarrhythmia. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, heart <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes the upper heart chambers, the RA and LA, and the lower heart chambers, the RV and LV and the coronary sinus (CS) extending from the opening in the RA laterally around the atria to form the great vein (GV) that extends further inferiorly into branches of the GV. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is an illustration of transmission of the cardiac depolarization waves through the RA, LA, RV and LV in a normal electrical activation sequence at a normal heart rate with the conduction times exhibited thereon in seconds. The cardiac cycle commences normally with the generation of the depolarization impulse at the SA Node in the right atrial wall and its transmission through the atrial conduction pathways of Bachmann&apos;s Bundle and the Internodal Tracts at the atrial level into the left atrial septum. The RA depolarization wave reaches the atrio-ventricular (AV) node and the atrial septum within about 40 msec and reaches the furthest walls of the RA and LA within about 70 msec, and the atria complete their contraction as a result. The aggregate RA and LA depolarization wave appears as the P-wave of the PQRST complex when sensed across external ECG electrodes and displayed. The component of the atrial depolarization wave passing between a pair of unipolar or bipolar pace/sense electrodes, respectively, located on or adjacent the RA or LA is also referred to as a sensed P-wave. Although the location and spacing of the external ECG electrodes or implanted unipolar atrial pace/sense electrodes has some influence, the normal P-wave width does not exceed 80 msec in width as measured by a high impedance sense amplifier coupled with such electrodes. A normal near field P-wave sensed between closely spaced bipolar pace/sense electrodes and located in or adjacent the RA or the LA has a width of no more than 60 msec as measured by a high impedance sense amplifier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The depolarization impulse that reaches the AV Node is distributed inferiorly down the bundle of His in the intraventricular septum after a delay of about 120 msec. The depolarization wave reaches the apical region of the heart about 20 msec later and is then travels superiorly though the Purkinje Fiber network over the remaining 40 msec. The aggregate RV and LV depolarization wave and the subsequent T-wave accompanying repolarization of the depolarized myocardium are referred to as the QRST portion of the PQRST cardiac cycle complex when sensed across external ECG electrodes and displayed. When the amplitude of the QRS ventricular depolarization wave passing between a bipolar or unipolar pace/sense electrode pair located on or adjacent the RV or LV exceeds a threshold amplitude, it is detected as a sensed R-wave. Although the location and spacing of the external ECG electrodes or implanted unipolar ventricular pace/sense electrodes has some influence, the normal R-wave width does not exceed 80 msec in width as measured by a high impedance sense amplifier. A normal near field R-wave sensed between closely spaced bipolar pace/sense electrodes and located in or adjacent the RV or the LV has a width of no more than 60 msec as measured by a high impedance sense amplifier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The typical normal conduction ranges of sequential activation are also described in the article by Durrer et al., entitled &ldquo;Total Excitation of the Isolated Human Heart&rdquo;, in CIRCULATION (Vol. XLI, pp. 899-912, June 1970). This normal electrical activation sequence becomes highly disrupted in patients suffering from advanced CHF and exhibiting Intra-Atrial Cardiac Dysfunction (IACD), LBBB, RBBB, and/or IVCD (Intra-Ventricular Cardiac Dysfunction). These conduction defects exhibit great asynchrony between the RV and the LV due to conduction disorders along the Bundle of His, the Right and Left Bundle Branches or at the more distal Purkinje Terminals. Typical intra-ventricular peak-peak asynchrony can range from 80 to 200 msec or longer. In RBBB and LBBB patients, the QRS complex is widened far beyond the normal range to from &gt;120 msec to 250 msec as measured on surface ECG. This increased width demonstrates the lack of synchrony of the right and left ventricular depolarizations and contractions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, a method and apparatus is provided to restore the depolarization sequence of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and the synchrony between the right and left ventricular heart chambers that contributes to adequate cardiac output based upon QRS duration. This restoration is effected through providing optimally timed cardiac pace pulses to the right and left ventricles as necessary and to account for the particular implantation sites of the pace/sense electrodes in relation to each heart chamber while maintaining AV synchrony. The present invention efficiently provides pacing at multiple ventricular pacing sites in a triggered pacing mode in response to a ventricular sense event detected at either ventricular pace/sense electrode site during the AV delay only. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a schematic representation of an implanted, three channel cardiac pacemaker of the above noted types for restoring AV synchronous contractions of the atrial and ventricular chambers and simultaneous or sequential pacing of the right and left ventricles. The pacemaker IPG <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is implanted subcutaneously in a patient&apos;s body between the skin and the ribs. Three endocardial leads <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> connect the IPG <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with the RA, the RV and the LV, respectively, through connections made in the IPG connector block <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>.

Alternatively, a plurality of such electrodes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may be formed in an array on the outer surface of the housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> or the connector block <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in a manner described in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 5,331,966. These electrodes may be selectively employed to measure the QRS duration as described further below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Any of the housing electrodes may be designated as a remote indifferent can electrode. For discussion purposes, this indifferent can electrode will be referred to hereinafter as &ldquo;IND_CAN electrode 22&rdquo;. This electrode may be employed in unipolar pacing and sensing combinations with a pace/sense electrode of one or more of the depicted leads <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The depicted positions of the pace/sense electrodes in or about the right and left heart chambers are also merely exemplary. Other leads and pace/sense electrodes may be used instead of the depicted leads and pace/sense electrodes that are adapted to be placed at electrode sites on or in or relative to the RA, LA, RV and LV. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The depicted bipolar endocardial RA lead <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is passed through a vein into the RA chamber of the heart <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and the distal end of the RA lead <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is attached to the RA wall by an attachment mechanism <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The bipolar endocardial RA lead <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is formed with an in-line connector <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> fitting into a bipolar bore of IPG connector block <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that is coupled to a pair of electrically insulated conductors within lead body <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and connected with distal tip RA pace/sense electrode <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and proximal ring RA pace/sense electrode <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Delivery of atrial pace pulses and sensing of atrial sense events is effected between the distal tip RA pace/sense electrode <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and proximal ring RA pace/sense electrode <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, wherein the proximal ring RA pace/sense electrode <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> functions as an indifferent electrode (IND_RA). Alternatively, a unipolar endocardial RA lead could be substituted for the depicted bipolar endocardial RA lead <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and be employed with the IND_CAN electrode <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Or, one of the distal tip RA pace/sense electrode <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and proximal ring RA pace/sense electrode <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> can be employed with the IND_CAN electrode <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> for unipolar pacing and/or sensing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Bipolar, endocardial RV lead <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is passed through the vein and the RA chamber of the heart <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and into the RV where its distal ring and tip RV pace/sense electrodes <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are fixed in place in the apex by a conventional distal attachment mechanism <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. The RV lead <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is formed with an in-line connector <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> fitting into a bipolar bore of IPG connector block <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that is coupled to a pair of electrically insulated conductors within lead body <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and connected with distal tip RV pace/sense electrode <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and proximal ring RV pace/sense electrode <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, wherein the proximal ring RV pace/sense electrode <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> functions as an indifferent electrode (IND_RV). Alternatively, a unipolar endocardial RV lead could be substituted for the depicted bipolar endocardial RV lead <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and be employed with the IND_CAN electrode <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In this illustrated embodiment, a bipolar, endocardial CS lead <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is passed through a vein and the RA chamber of the heart <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, into the CS and then inferiorly in a branching vessel of the great vein GV to extend the proximal and distal LV CS pace/sense electrodes <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> alongside the LV chamber. The distal end of such a CS lead is advanced through the superior vena cava, the right atrium, the ostium of the coronary sinus, the coronary sinus (CS), and into a coronary vein descending from the coronary sinus, such as the great vein (GV). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In a four chamber or channel embodiment, LV CS lead <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> could bear proximal LA CS pace/sense electrodes <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> positioned along the CS lead body to lie in the larger diameter CS adjacent the LA. Typically, LV CS leads and LA CS leads do not employ any fixation mechanism and instead rely on the close confinement within these vessels to maintain the pace/sense electrode or electrodes at a desired site. The LV CS lead <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is formed with a multiple conductor lead body <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> coupled at the proximal end connector <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> fitting into a bore of IPG connector block <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A small diameter lead body <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is selected in order to lodge the distal LV CS pace/sense electrode <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> deeply in a vein branching inferiorly from the great vein GV. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In this case, the CS lead body <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> would encase four electrically insulated lead conductors extending proximally from the more proximal LA CS pace/sense electrode(s) and terminating in a dual bipolar connector <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The LV CS lead body would be smaller between the LA CS pace/sense electrodes <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the LV CS pace/sense electrodes <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. It will be understood that LV CS lead <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> could bear a single LA CS pace/sense electrode <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and/or a single LV CS pace/sense electrode <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> that are paired with the IND_CAN electrode <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> or the ring electrodes <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, respectively for pacing and sensing in the LA and LV, respectively. </paragraph>

The IPG circuit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is illustrated in a functional block diagram divided generally into a microcomputer circuit <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and a pacing circuit <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. The pacing circuit <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> includes the digital controller/timer circuit <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, the output amplifiers circuit <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>, the sense amplifiers circuit <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight>, the RF telemetry transceiver <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>, the activity sensor circuit <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>, the EGM amplifiers circuit <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight>, and a number of other circuits and components described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Crystal oscillator circuit <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> provides the basic timing clock for the pacing circuit <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, while battery <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> provides power. Power-on-reset circuit <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> responds to initial connection of the circuit to the battery for defining an initial operating condition and similarly, resets the operative state of the device in response to detection of a low battery condition. Reference mode circuit <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> generates stable voltage reference and currents for the analog circuits within the pacing circuit <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, while analog to digital converter ADC and multiplexer circuit <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> digitizes analog signals and voltage to provide real time telemetry if a cardiac signals from sense amplifiers <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight>, for uplink transmission via transceiver <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>. Voltage reference and bias circuit <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight>, ADC and multiplexer <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight>, power-on-reset circuit <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> and crystal oscillator circuit <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> may correspond to any of those presently used in current marketed implantable cardiac pacemakers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> If the IPG is programmed to a rate responsive mode, the signals output by one or more physiologic sensor are employed as a rate control parameter (RCP) to derive a physiologic escape interval. For example, the escape interval is adjusted proportionally the patient&apos;s activity level developed in the patient activity sensor (PAS) circuit <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> in the depicted, exemplary IPG circuit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. The patient activity sensor <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> is coupled to the IPG housing and may take the form of a piezoelectric crystal transducer as is well known in the art and its output signal is processed and used as the RCP. Sensor <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> generates electrical signals in response to sensed physical activity that are processed by activity circuit <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> and provided to digital controller/timer circuit <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. Activity circuit <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> and associated sensor <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> may correspond to the circuitry disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,052,388 and 4,428,378. Similarly, the present invention may be practiced in conjunction with alternate types of sensors such as oxygenation sensors, pressure sensors, pH sensors and respiration sensors, all well known for use in providing rate responsive pacing capabilities. Alternately, QT time may be used as the rate indicating parameter, in which case no extra sensor is required. Similarly, the present invention may also be practiced in non-rate responsive pacemakers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Data transmission to and from the external programmer is accomplished by means of the telemetry antenna <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> and transceiver <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>, which serves both to demodulate received downlink telemetry and to transmit uplink telemetry. Uplink telemetry capabilities will typically include the ability to transmit stored digital information, e.g. operating modes and parameters, EGM histograms, and other events, as well as real time EGMs of atrial and/or ventricular electrical activity and Marker Channel pulses indicating the occurrence of sensed and paced depolarizations in the atrium and ventricle, as are well known in the pacing art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Microcomputer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> contains a microprocessor <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> and associated system clock <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> and on-processor RAM and ROM chips <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, respectively. In addition, microcomputer circuit <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> includes a separate RAM/ROM chip <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> to provide additional memory capacity. Microprocessor <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> normally operates in a reduced power consumption mode and is interrupt driven. Microprocessor <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> may be awakened in response to defined interrupt events, which may include A-TRIG, RV-TRIG, and LV-TRIG signals generated by timers in digital timer/controller circuit <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, and/or A-EVENT, RV-EVENT, and LV-EVENT signals generated by sense amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight>, among others. The specific values of the intervals and delays timed by digital controller/timer circuit <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> are controlled by the microcomputer circuit <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> by means of data and control bus <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> from programmed-in parameter values and operating modes. In addition, if programmed to operate as a rate responsive pacemaker, a timed interrupt at a predetermined interval such as every two seconds, may be provided in order to allow the microprocessor to analyze the sensor data and update the basic A-A, V-A and/or V-V escape intervals. In addition, in a preferred embodiment of the invention, the microprocessor <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> may also serve to define variable AV delays and the biventricular V-V delays in accordance with the routines illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the invention, microprocessor <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is a custom microprocessor adapted to fetch and execute instructions stored in RAM/ROM unit <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> in a conventional manner. It is contemplated, however, that other implementations may be suitable to practice the present invention. For example, an off-the-shelf, commercially-available microprocessor or microcontroller, or custom application-specific, hardwired logic, or state-machine type circuit may perform the functions of microprocessor <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Digital controller/timer circuit <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> operates under the general control of the microcomputer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> to control timing and other functions within the pacing circuit <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and includes a set of timing and associated logic circuits of which certain ones pertinent to the present invention are depicted. The depicted timing circuits include an upper rate interval (URI) timer <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight>, V-V delay timer <highlight><bold>366</bold></highlight>, an intrinsic interval timer <highlight><bold>368</bold></highlight> for timing elapsed VEVENT to V-EVENT intervals or V-EVENT to A-EVENT intervals, escape interval timers <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> for timing A-A, V-A, and/or V-V pacing escape intervals, an AV delay interval timer <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> for timing an AV delays from a preceding A-EVENT (SAV delay) or A-TRIG (PAV delay), and a post-event timer <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight> for timing post-ventricular time periods. RHC pace trigger and sense events are typically used for starting and resetting these intervals and periods. However, it would be possible to allow the physician to select and program trans-chamber or LHC pace trigger and sense events for these timing purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The post-event timer <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight> times the post-ventricular time periods following an RV-EVENT or LV-EVENT or a RV-TRIG or LV-TRIG and post-atrial time periods following an A-EVENT or A-TRIG. The durations of the post-event time periods may also be selected as programmable parameters stored in the microcomputer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. The post-ventricular time periods include the PVARP, a post-atrial ventricular blanking period (PAVBP), a ventricular blanking period (VBP), and a ventricular refractory period (VRP). The post-atrial time periods include an atrial refractory period (ARP) during which an A-EVENT is ignored for the purpose of resetting the AV delay, and an atrial blanking period (ABP) during which atrial sensing is disabled. These post-atrial time periods time out concurrently with the time-out of the SAV delay or PAV delay started by an A-EVENT or an A-TRIG. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the starting of the post-atrial time periods and the AV delays can be commenced substantially simultaneously with the start or end of the A-EVENT or the A-TRIG or, in the latter case, upon the start of end of the A-PACE which may follow the A-TRIG. Similarly, the starting of the post-ventricular time periods and the V-A escape interval can be commenced substantially simultaneously with the start or end of the V-EVENT or V-TRIG or, in the latter case, upon the start of end of the V-PACE which may follow the V-TRIG. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The microprocessor <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> also optionally calculates AV delays, post-ventricular time periods, and post-atrial time periods that vary with the sensor based escape interval established in response to the RCP(s) and/or with the intrinsic atrial rate. The variable AV delays are usually derived as a fraction of a maximum AV delay set for the pacing LRL (i.e., the longest escape interval). In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, the AV delays can be varied from the prevailing AV delay as a function of measured QRS duration so as to minimize the width of the QRS complex. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The output amplifiers circuit <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> contains a RA pace pulse generator (and a LA pace pulse generator if LA pacing is provided), a RV pace pulse generator, and a LV pace pulse generator corresponding to any of those presently employed in commercially marketed cardiac pacemakers providing atrial and ventricular pacing. In order to trigger generation of an RV-PACE or LV-PACE pulse, digital controller/timer circuit <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> generates a RV-TRIG or LV-TRIG signal at the end of a paced AV (PAV delay) delay or a sensed AV (SAV delay) delay provided by AV delay interval timer <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight>. Similarly, digital controller/timer circuit <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> generates an RA-TRIG signal that triggers output of an RA-PACE pulse (or an LA-TRIG signal that triggers output of an LA-PACE pulse if provided) at the end of the V-A escape interval timed by escape interval timers <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The output amplifiers circuit <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> includes switching circuits for coupling selected pace/sense electrode pairs from among the lead conductors and the IND_CAN electrode <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to the RA pace pulse generator (and LA pace pulse generator if provided), RV pace pulse generator and LV pace pulse generator. Pace/sense electrode pair selection and control circuit <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> selects lead conductors and associated pace/sense electrode pairs to be coupled with the atrial and ventricular output amplifiers within output amplifiers circuit <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> for accomplishing RA, LA, RV and LV pacing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The sense amplifiers circuit <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> contains sense amplifiers corresponding to any of those presently employed in commercially marketed cardiac pacemakers for atrial and ventricular pacing and sensing. As noted in the above-referenced, commonly assigned, &apos;324 patent, it has been common in the prior art to use very high impedance P-wave and R-wave sense amplifiers to amplify the voltage difference signal which is generated across the sense electrode pairs by the passage of a cardiac depolarization. The high impedance sense amplifiers use high gain to amplify the low amplitude signals and rely on pass band filters, time domain filtering and amplitude threshold comparison to discriminate a P-wave or R-wave from background electrical noise. Digital controller/timer circuit <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> controls sensitivity settings of the atrial and ventricular sense amplifiers <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The sense amplifiers in sense amplifiers circuit <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> are uncoupled from the sense electrodes during the blanking periods before, during, and after delivery of a pace pulse to any of the pace/sense electrodes of the pacing system to avoid saturation of the sense amplifiers. The sense amplifiers circuit <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> includes blanking circuits for uncoupling the selected pairs of the lead conductors and the IND_CAN electrode <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> from the inputs of the RA sense amplifier (and LA sense amplifier if provided), RV sense amplifier and LV sense amplifier during the ABP, PVABP and VBP. The sense amplifiers circuit <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> also includes switching circuits for coupling selected sense electrode lead conductors and the IND_CAN electrode <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to the RA sense amplifier (and LA sense amplifier if provided), RV sense amplifier and LV sense amplifier. Again, sense electrode selection and control circuit <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> selects conductors and associated sense electrode pairs to be coupled with the atrial and ventricular sense amplifiers within the output amplifiers circuit <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> and sense amplifiers circuit <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> for accomplishing RA, LA, RV and LV sensing along desired unipolar and bipolar sensing vectors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Right atrial depolarizations or P-waves in the RA-SENSE signal that are sensed by the RA sense amplifier result in a RA-EVENT signal that is communicated to the digital controller/timer circuit <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. Similarly, left atrial depolarizations or P-waves in the LA-SENSE signal that are sensed by the LA sense amplifier, if provided, result in an LA-EVENT signal that is communicated to the digital controller/timer circuit <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. Ventricular depolarizations or R-waves in the RV-SENSE signal are sensed by a ventricular sense amplifier and result in an RV-EVENT signal that is communicated to the digital controller/timer circuit <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. Similarly, ventricular depolarizations or R-waves in the LV-SENSE signal are sensed by a ventricular sense amplifier and result in an LV-EVENT signal that is communicated to the digital controller/timer circuit <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. The RV-EVENT, LV-EVENT, and RA-EVENT, LA-SENSE signals may be refractory or non-refractory, and can inadvertently be triggered by electrical noise signals or aberrantly conducted depolarization waves rather than true R-waves or P-waves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> To simplify the description of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 through 6</cross-reference>A-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>B, it will be assumed that the following references to an &ldquo;A-EVENT&rdquo; and &ldquo;A-PACE&rdquo; will be the RA-EVENT and RA-PACE, respectively, if there is no LA pacing or sensing provided or programmably-enabled. Otherwise, these references will refer to the programmably-enabled one of the RA-EVENT or LA-EVENT and RA-PACE or LA-PACE, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The possible operating modes of IPG circuit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> are depicted in the flow chart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> and described as follows. The particular operating mode of the present invention is a programmed or hard-wired sub-set of the possible operating modes as also described below. The AV delay is started in step S<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> when a P-wave outside of refractory is sensed across the selected atrial sense electrode pair during the V-A escape interval (an A-EVENT) as determined in step S<highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> or an A-PACE pulse is delivered to the selected atrial pace/sense electrode pair in step S<highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. The AV delay can be a PAV delay or SAV delay, depending upon whether it is started on an A-PACE or an A-EVENT, respectively, and is timed out by the SAV delay/PAV delay timer <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight>. The SAV delay or PAV delay is terminated upon a non-refractory RV-EVENT or LV-EVENT output by a ventricular sense amplifier prior to its time-out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The post-event timers <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight> are started to time out the post-ventricular time periods and the TRIG_PACE window, and the V-A escape interval timer <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> is started to time out the V-A escape interval in step S<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> if the SAV delay or PAV delay times out in step S<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> without the detection of a non-refractory RV-EVENT or LV-EVENT. The TRIG_PACE window inhibits triggered pacing modes in response to a sense event occurring too early in the escape interval. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Either a programmed one or both of the RV-PACE and LV-PACE pulses are delivered in step S<highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> (as shown in the flow chart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) to selected RV and LV pace/sense electrode pairs, and the V-A escape interval timer is timed out in step S<highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. When both of the RV-PACE and LV-PACE pulses are delivered, the first is referred to as V-PACE<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the second is referred to as V-PACE<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and they are separated by a VP-VP delay. As described in greater detail below in reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>B, if a bi-ventricular pacing mode is programmed in step S <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, it can be selectively programmed in a left-to-right ventricle (LV-RV) or right-to-left ventricle (RV-LV) pacing sequence wherein the first and second delivered ventricular pace pulses are separated by separately programmed VP-VP delays. The VP-VP delays are preferably programmable between about 4 msec and about 80 msec. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, the QRS duration of a paced ventricular event following delivery of V-PACE<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the selected RV or LV pace/sense electrode pair is selectively measured by a QRS duration timer <highlight><bold>376</bold></highlight> within the digital controller/timer circuit <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. The QRS duration timer <highlight><bold>376</bold></highlight> receives the output of an EGM sense amplifier in the EGM amplifiers circuit <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> that is coupled with a selected QRS duration sensing pair of pace/sense electrodes or with a pair of the housing sense electrodes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to detect the far field EGM in a manner described in the above-referenced &apos;966 patent. A slope and/or threshold detector can be employed in the EGM amplifiers circuit <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> for determining the start and end of the QRS waveform following V-PACE<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The pair of the housing sense electrodes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> that provide the highest amplitude or fidelity EGM signal is preferred because the far field more &ldquo;global&rdquo; EGM signal more closely approximates an ECG signal from external skin electrodes and the blanking time during and following delivery of the V-PACE<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> pulse can be minimized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Returning to step S<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the AV delay is terminated if an RV-EVENT or LV-EVENT (collectively, a V-EVENT) is generated by the RV sense amplifier or the LV sense amplifier in step S<highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. The time-out of the V-A escape interval and the post-ventricular time periods are started in step S<highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> in response to the V-EVENT. In step S<highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, it is determined whether a ventricular-triggered pacing mode is programmed to be operative during the AV delay. In accordance with the present invention, a ventricular-triggered pacing mode is programmed on, and it is undertaken and completed in step S<highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> (FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>B). Any VSP mode that may otherwise be available is programmed off. The time-out of the TRIG_PACE window is commenced in step S<highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> simultaneously with the time-out of the V-A escape interval and post-event time periods in step S<highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> If the V-A atrial escape interval is timed out by timer <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> in step S<highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> without a non-refractory A-EVENT being sensed across the selected pair of atrial sense electrodes, then the A-PACE pulse is delivered across the selected RA pace/sense electrode pair in step S<highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, the AV delay is set to PAV delay in step S<highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, and the AV delay is commenced by AV delay timer <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> If a non-refractory A-EVENT is sensed as determined in steps S<highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, then the V-A escape interval is terminated. The ABP and ARP are commenced by post-event timers <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight> in step S<highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, the AV delay is set to the SAV delay in step S<highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>, and the SAV delay is started in step S<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and timed out by SAV delay/PAV delay timer <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Assuming that the goal is to restore the normal activation sequence, a programmed SAV delay and PAV delay corresponding to a normal AV conduction time from the AV node to the bundle of His are used. Alternatively, SAV delay/PAV delay timer <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> may calculate the SAV and PAV delays in relation to the prevailing sensor rate or sensed intrinsic heart rate. The SAV delay may be timed from an RA-EVENT or LA-EVENT, and the PAV delay may be timed from an RA-PACE or an LA-PACE pulse. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> At the expiration of the V-A escape interval in step S<highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>, is it determined whether an RV-EVENT, LV-EVENT, or a collective V-EVENT (all hereinafter referred to as a &ldquo;V-EVENT&rdquo;) is sensed across the RV tip sense electrode or the LV sense electrode. Next, it is determined whether this sensed event is a non-refractory V-EVENT in step S<highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. If the V-EVENT is determined to be a non-refractory V-EVENT, then the TRIG_PACE window is started or restarted, the V-A escape interval is restarted, and the post-ventricular time periods are restarted in step S<highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, it is determined whether a ventricular-triggered pacing mode is programmed to be operative during the V-A escape interval. Ventricular triggered pacing during the V-A escape interval is not programmed on, or is not provided in the pacing system, when triggered ventricular pacing is inappropriate for the patient. If ventricular triggered pacing during the V-A escape interval is programmed on, then it is undertaken and completed in step S<highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> (FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>B). If triggered pacing is not programmed on as determined in step S<highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, then no ventricular pacing is triggered by the sensed non-refractory V-EVENT during the V-A escape interval. Steps S<highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> are merely included herein to complete the disclosure of one form of an AV synchronous pacing system in which the present invention may be incorporated. It will be understood that the present invention can be incorporated into an AV synchronous pacing system that does not include steps S<highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> depicts the step S<highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> in greater detail, and FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>B depict the steps S<highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> in greater detail. If a VP-VP pacing mode is programmed on in step S<highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, it can be selectively programmed in a left-to-right or right-to-left ventricle sequence, wherein the first and second delivered ventricular pace pulses (V-PACE<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and V-PACE<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) are separated by separately programmed VP-VP delays. If a bi-ventricular triggered pacing mode is programmed on in either or both of steps S<highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, it can be selectively programmed to immediately pace the ventricle from which the V-EVENT is sensed or a fixed or programmed ventricle regardless of where the V-EVENT is sensed with a V-PACE<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Then, the V-PACE<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is generated to synchronously pace the other ventricle after a programmed VS/VP-VP delay. Or, the triggered pacing mode can be selectively programmed in either or both of steps S<highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> to only synchronously pace the other ventricle than the ventricle from which the V-EVENT is sensed with V-PACE<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> after separately programmable VS-VP delays, depending on the right-to-left or left-to-right sequence. All of these VP-VP, VS/VP-VP, and VS-VP delays are preferably programmable between nearly 0 msec and about 80 msec. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> As a practical matter, the minimum VS/VP-VP, and VP-VP delays may be set to one half the system clock cycle in order to avoid simultaneous delivery of RV-PACE and LV-PACE pulses. The pace pulse width is typically programmable between about 0.5 msec and 2.0 msec, and the pace pulse amplitude is typically programmable between 0.5 and 7.5 volts. The system clock provides a full clock cycle of about 8.0 msec. Therefore, the minimum VP-VP delay is set at a half clock cycle or about 4.0 msec. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the IPG circuit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> can be programmed to either only deliver a single RV-PACE or LV-PACE (V-PACE<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) or the pair of RV-PACE and LV-PACE pulses (V-PACE<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and V-PACE<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) separated by the VP-VP delay timed out by V-V delay timer <highlight><bold>366</bold></highlight>. If delivery of only a single RV-PACE or LV-PACE is programmed as determined in step S<highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, then it is delivered in step S<highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The present invention is operative when VS-VP, VS/VP-VP or VP-VP pacing modes are programmed on in order to measure the QRS duration of the ventricular depolarization occurring after delivery of V-PACE<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to obtain diagnostic trend data indicative of the state or progression of heart failure. In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, the optimal V-V delay, and optionally, the optimal PAV delay or SAV delay or the combination of such synchronous pacing delays that minimizes the measured QRS duration and maximizes mechanical heart performance is determined. All of the possible pacing modes are described herein before describing an implementation of these features of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> If VP-VP pacing is programmed on in step S<highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, then V-PACE<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is delivered in step S<highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> in the programmed RV-LV or LV-RV sequence. Again, the RV-PACE pulse is typically delivered across the active RV tip electrode <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and one of the available indifferent electrodes that is programmed and selected through the pace/sense electrode selection and control <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> depending on the desired RV pacing vector as set forth above, and also depending upon which electrodes are present in the system. And, the LV-PACE pulse is delivered across the active LV pace/sense electrode <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and the IND_RV pace/sense electrode <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> in the trans-ventricular pacing path <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The V-PACE<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> pace pulse is delivered at a programmed pulse energy dictated by the programmed voltage and pulse width. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The V-V delay timer <highlight><bold>366</bold></highlight> is loaded with the programmed VP-VP delay and starts to time out in step S<highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. If the RV-PACE pulse is V-PACE<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, then a programmed VP-VP delay is timed in V-V delay timer <highlight><bold>366</bold></highlight>. The LV-PACE pulse can be delivered as V-PACE<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the LV pacing path <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> between the active LV pace/sense electrode <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and IND_RV pace/sense electrode <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> in step S<highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> after time-out of the programmed VP-VP delay in step S<highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. Conversely, if the LV-PACE pulse is the first to be delivered (V-PACE<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) in the pacing path <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, then a programmed VP-VP delay is timed in V-V delay timer <highlight><bold>366</bold></highlight>. The RV-PACE pulse is then delivered as V-PACE<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> typically across the active RV pace/sense electrode <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the programmed indifferent electrode in step S<highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> after time-out of the programmed VP-VP delay in step S<highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>B is a flow chart illustrating the steps S<highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> for delivering ventricular pace pulses triggered by a ventricular sense event in step S<highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> during the time-out of an AV delay, or in step S<highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> during time-out of the V-A escape interval. It may be noted that these steps are optional, and may not be provided in some devices, or alternatively, may be designed to be programmably enabled/disabled. As noted above, the sensing of R-waves in the RV and LV can be accomplished by employing several RV-SENSE and LV-SENSE sensing axes or vectors and the trans-ventricular sensing vector. The selected vectors may include the bipolar RV-SENSE vector (RV sense electrodes <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>), a unipolar RV-SENSE vector (RV tip sense electrode <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and IND_CAN electrode <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>), a unipolar LV-SENSE vector (LV sense electrode <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and IND_CAN electrode <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>), and a trans-ventricular, combined RV-SENSE and LV-SENSE vector (RV tip sense electrode <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and LV sense electrode <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>). The selection of the sensing vectors would depend upon heart condition and the selection of the pace pulse pathways. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The IPG circuit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> can be separately programmed in one of three triggered pacing modes designated VS/VP, VS/VP-VP or VS-VP triggered modes for step S<highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. In the VS/VP triggered pacing mode, a V-PACE<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is delivered without delay upon a RV-EVENT or LV-EVENT to the RV or LV pacing pathway, respectively. In the VS/VP-VP triggered pacing mode, the V-PACE<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is delivered without delay upon a RV-EVENT or LV-EVENT to the selected RV or LV pacing electrode pair, respectively, and a V-PACE<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is delivered to the other of the selected LV or RV pacing electrode pair after the VS/VP-VP delay times out. In the VS-VP pacing mode, a RV-EVENT or the LV-EVENT starts time-out of a VS-VP delay, and a single pace pulse (designated V-PACE<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) is delivered to the selected LV or the RV pace/sense electrode pair, respectively, when the VS-VP delay times out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The TRIG_PACE time window started by a prior V-EVENT or V-PACE must have timed out in step S<highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> prior to delivery of any triggered ventricular pace pulses. If it has not timed out, then triggered pacing cannot be delivered in response to a sensed V-EVENT. If the TRIG_PACE window has timed out, it is then restarted in step S<highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, and the programmed triggered pacing modes are checked in steps S<highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> When IPG circuit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is programmed in the VS/VP-VP triggered mode as determined in step S<highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, the non-refractory RV-EVENT or LV-EVENT or collective V-EVENT of indeterminable origin is treated as a single V-EVENT. If the TRIG_PACE window has timed out as determined in step S<highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, then the single V-EVENT triggers the immediate delivery of a programmed one of the RV-PACE or a LV-PACE as V-PACE<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> across the programmed bipolar or unipolar RV and LV pace/sense electrode pair, respectively, in step S<highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. Thus, V-PACE<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is delivered to a predetermined RV or LV pace/sense electrode pair, regardless of whether a RV-EVENT and LV-EVENT is sensed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Then, a VS/VP-VP delay is started in step S<highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> and timed out in step S<highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. The VS/VP-VP delay is specified as a VP-VP delay when the RV-PACE is V-PACE<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the LV-PACE is V-PACE<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The VS/VP-VP delay is specified as a VP-VP delay when the LV-PACE is V-PACE<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the RV-PACE is V-PACE<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The LV-PACE or RV-PACE pulse is delivered at the programmed amplitude and pulse width across the programmed LV or RV pace/sense electrode pair in step S<highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> In the simplest embodiment of the present invention, the VS/VP-VP mode would be the only triggered ventricular pacing mode provided. The remaining steps of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</cross-reference> are described in the event that the VS/VP and/or the VS-VP triggered ventricular pacing mode is included in the pacing system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, it is determined whether the VS-VP triggered pacing mode or the VS/VP triggered pacing mode is programmed. When the IPG circuit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is programmed to a single heart chamber VS/VP triggered pacing mode, the RV-EVENT or LV-EVENT triggers the immediate delivery of an RV-PACE or an LV-PACE across a programmed bipolar or unipolar RV or LV pace/sense electrode pair, respectively, in step S<highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>, regardless of whether an RV-EVENT or LV-EVENT was sensed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> When the IPG circuit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is programmed to the VS-VP triggered pacing mode, an LV-EVENT as determined in step S<highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> loads the appropriate VS-VP delay in V-V delay timer <highlight><bold>366</bold></highlight> in step S<highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and starts the VS-VP delay time-out in step S<highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>. The RV-PACE is delivered at its time-out in step S<highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> (also designated V-PACE<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). If an RV-EVENT is determined in step S<highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>, then the appropriate VS-VP delay is loaded in V-V delay timer <highlight><bold>366</bold></highlight> in step S<highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight>, and the VS-VP delay is timed out in step S<highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight>. The LV-PACE (also designated V-PACE<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) is delivered at time-out of the VS-VP delay in step S<highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Returning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the V-A escape interval is timed out in step S<highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> following the completion of the ventricular pacing mode of FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>B. If the V-A escape interval times out, then an RA-PACE pulse is typically first delivered across the RA pace/sense electrodes <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> in step S<highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, and the AV delay timer is restarted in step S<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Thus, it will be observed that the multi-site, AV sequential, bi-ventricular cardiac pacing system described above is selectively programmable to provide ventricular pacing pulses delivered to one or both of the RV and LV sites synchronously within a V-V delay following time-out of an AV delay from a preceding delivered A-PACE pulse or an A-EVENT (typically, the RA-PACE pulse or the RA-EVENT) and operating in accordance with the steps of: (a) timing an AV delay from a preceding delivered A-PACE pulse or A-EVENT; (b) detecting a V-SENSE at one of a first and second ventricular site within the AV delay and, in response, terminating the AV delay and providing a V-EVENT; (c) delivering a V-PACE<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> pulse to a selected one of the first and second ventricular sites upon the time-out of the AV delay or, in a triggered mode, upon the V-SENSE; (d) timing a V-V delay comprising one of a VS-VP pace delay from a V-EVENT that occurred prior to the time-out of the AV delay, or alternatively, timing a VP-VP pace delay from the V-PACE<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> delivered at the end of the AV delay, or timing a VS/VP-VP pace delay from a triggered V-PACE<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>; and (e) delivering a V-PACE<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> pulse to the other of the first and second ventricular sites upon the time-out of the V-V delay. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates the overall IMD function starting from the time of implantation (step S<highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>), initial programming (steps <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>), and baseline parameter measurements (step S<highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>). The illustrated steps continue through successive cycles of gathering parameter data in the IMD (steps S<highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>-S<highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight>), and uplink telemetry transmission of the accumulated data to an external programmer (steps S<highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>-S<highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight>) for display and analysis (step S<highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight>). This may result in possible reprogramming (step S<highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>) and baseline parameter measurement (step S<highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>) to better assess the heart failure state. Optionally, the pacing parameters, particularly the SAV delay, PAV delay and/or the V-V delay, can be adjusted and the optimal QRS duration determined again in step S<highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> illustrated in greater detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. The present invention may be implemented into a versatile multi-chamber pacing system as described above, or into a less comprehensive pacing system offering fewer programmable pacing parameters and operating modes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Each pacing parameter may be programmably enabled. A particular event trigger for initiating the measurement of the programmably enabled parameter, as well as any specific measurement criteria, can be programmed in step S<highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. This may be accomplished using conventional downlink telemetry transmitted commands that are received in the telemetry transceiver <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> and forwarded to the digital controller/timer circuit <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. The physician may initially program the pacemaker to deliver a bi-ventricular stimulation therapy in accordance with selected options provided in the flow charts of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4, 5</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>B as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, baseline parameter measurements are optionally performed for each programmably-enabled parameter to collect baseline or reference parameter data. In particular, the QRS duration reference or QRS_DUR<highlight><subscript>REF </subscript></highlight>data may be collected. This data may be stored in RAM <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and transmitted to the external programmer for observation by the physician. It may further be used to program the operating modes and parameter values, e.g., the LRL SAV, PAV, and/or V-V delays. The determined QRS_DUR<highlight><subscript>REF </subscript></highlight>value represents the optimal, shortest, QRS duration that can be obtained by adjustment of the SAV delay, PAV delay and/or V-V delay in steps S<highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. The SAV delay, PAV delay and/or V-V delay are programmed to the SAV delay, PAV delay and/or V-V delay determined in step S<highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. The initial QRS_DUR<highlight><subscript>REF </subscript></highlight>value is then stored in the IMD memory and also stored externally in a patient file maintained by the physician with a date and time stamp and other pertinent data such as patient activity level measured by activity signal processor circuit <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> and patient heart rate and stability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Periodically, the programmably-enabled parameters including the QRS_DUR<highlight><subscript>SAMPLE </subscript></highlight>values are measured in step S<highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> and stored in step S<highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>. This may be performed when an event trigger parameter occurs. In addition, an algorithm to adjust the V-V, SAV, and/or PAV delays to provide a measured QRS_DUR<highlight><subscript>MIN </subscript></highlight>value can be entered and performed in step S<highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> as shown in detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. The event criteria of step S<highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> may be a programmed time or multiple times of every day. Alternatively, specified days of the week or month, or the detection of a patient-initiated parameter measurement may be utilized as the trigger. Other programmed event such as a combination of one or more times of day, and/or a level of patient exercise indicated by the activity signal processor circuit <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> may also provide the trigger condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the measurement of the QRS duration to derive QRS_DUR<highlight><subscript>SAMPLE </subscript></highlight>data or to develop a derive QRS_DUR<highlight><subscript>MIN </subscript></highlight>pursuant to step S<highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> should take place when the heart rate is in a normal range and is stable within a certain stability tolerance. This criteria can be programmed by the physician and are determined over a series of heart cycles in steps S<highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> S<highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> in a manner well known in the art. In one embodiment of the invention, the measurement of the QRS duration is only performed in step S<highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> when the patient is at rest or within a programmed exercise range as determined in step S<highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>. Typically, in step S<highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>, incidences of spontaneous RA-EVENTs and RV-EVENTs would be monitored while the escape interval establishing the pacing rate is set to the LRI to determine the intrinsic heart rate. The heart rate would be established by the pacing lower rate if the rate cannot be determined in this way. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> In this particular case, the determination of a single QRS_DUR<highlight><subscript>SAMPLE </subscript></highlight>data point in step S<highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> would be conducted within one heart cycle. In this instance, heart rate, heart stability and activity level changes would not be measured when that single data point is derived. Alternatively, heart rate, stability and activity level changes become more pertinent if the IMD is programmed to derive an average QRS_DUR<highlight><subscript>SAMPLES </subscript></highlight>maximum, and/or minimum QRS_DUR<highlight><subscript>SAMPLE </subscript></highlight>values over a programmed number of heart cycles and sample values. Therefore, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> depicts the possible operation wherein the heart rate, heart stability, and patient activity level are re-determined in steps S<highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> through S<highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> before each QRS duration measurement or the programmed series is undertaken. The determination of average QRS_DUR<highlight><subscript>SAMPLE</subscript></highlight>, maximum, and minimum QRS_DUR<highlight><subscript>SAMPLE </subscript></highlight>values in step S<highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> may be aborted if the heart rate, stability and/or activity level changes such that the criteria is no longer satisfied before the parameter measurement steps are completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the invention, the algorithm may determine one or more of the settings of the SAV delay, PAV delay and/or V-V delay parameters that achieve the shortest QRS_DUR<highlight><subscript>MIN </subscript></highlight>value. This is shown in step S<highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, a programmable delay of a number of heart cycles is provided between each adjustment of a parameter value and the measurement of the QRS_DUR<highlight><subscript>SAMPLE </subscript></highlight>value to allow the heart to stabilize as described further below. The shortest achievable QRS_DUR<highlight><subscript>SAMPLE </subscript></highlight>value is retained in memory as the QRS_DUR<highlight><subscript>MIN </subscript></highlight>value along with the particular settings of the V-V, SAV, and/or PAV delay that provides that QRS_DUR<highlight><subscript>MIN </subscript></highlight>value. These parameter settings are then employed in the operation of the pacing system pursuant to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 through 6</cross-reference>B until they are derived again. As in the embodiment described in the foregoing paragraph, the calculation of these parameters may be aborted if the heart rate, stability and/or activity level changes such that predetermined criteria is no longer satisfied before the calculations are completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The QRS duration is measured as described above following the delivery of a V-PACE<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the RV or LV after a V-PACE<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or a V-EVENT occurs in the other of the LV or RV after time-out of the governing one of the VS-VP, VSNVP-VP or VP-VP delays. Then, the single or average, QRS_DUR<highlight><subscript>SAMPLE </subscript></highlight>value and maximum and minimum QRS_DUR<highlight><subscript>SAMPLE </subscript></highlight>values are obtained. As noted above, the QRS duration measurement preferably takes place using a selected pair of the housing sense electrodes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> coupled to the EGM sense amplifiers circuit <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight>, although other electrode pairs can be selected via pace/sense selection and control <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The completed one or more of a single or average, maximum, and minimum QRS_DUR<highlight><subscript>SAMPLE </subscript></highlight>values is stored in IMD memory with a date, time stamp and any other pertinent information such as heart rate and patient activity level, in step S<highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>. Steps S<highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> through S<highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> are repeated each time that the event trigger criteria for the QRS duration measurement are satisfied. The data collection continues over many days or months until the initiation of a telemetry session by the physician and uplink telemetry transmission of the accumulated parameter data in steps S<highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight>. The history of the number, times and dates of successive parameter measurements can also be stored in IMD memory, but the stored parameter data and related data may be discarded on a FIFO basis if the memory capacity assigned to such data storage is exceeded. The physician then reviews the accumulated data in step S<highlight><bold>428</bold></highlight> and can reprogram the values of the AV delays and the V-V delay, which can either be RV-LV delay and/or the LV-RV delay, repeating steps S<highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> In S<highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>, changes are automatically made to the SAV delay, PAV delay and/or V-V delay to derive a minimum QRS duration (QRS_DUR<highlight><subscript>MIN</subscript></highlight>) from a series of measured QRS<highlight><subscript>13 </subscript></highlight>DUR<highlight><subscript>SAMPLE </subscript></highlight>values obtained by dithering the values of one or more of the V-V delay, the SAV delay and the PAV delay. Step S<highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> can be programmed on or off and thereby bypassed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. No parameter changes are made if step S<highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> is disabled, but the physician still obtains valuable data illustrating the trend in QRS duration in the course of following the steps of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> that can be analyzed to determine whether the patient&apos;s heart failure state is improving or deteriorating. If it appears that the QRS duration is remaining stable or shortening over time, then it may be presumed that the applied pacing therapy and drug therapy is of benefit. If the QRS duration is lengthening, then adjustments in therapy, including repeating steps S<highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> to determine if it can be shortened, need to be undertaken. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> In one variation of this aspect of the invention, the SAV, PAV and/or V-V delays providing the minimum QRS duration is derived by successively applying incremented or decremented ones of the SAV delay, PAV delay and/or V-V delay, deriving a QRS<highlight><subscript>13 </subscript></highlight>DUR<highlight><subscript>SAMPLE </subscript></highlight>value at each adjusted delay, comparing the set of N derived QRS_DUR<highlight><subscript>SAMPLE </subscript></highlight>values to determine the minimum QRS<highlight><subscript>13 </subscript></highlight>DUR<highlight><subscript>SAMPLE </subscript></highlight>value, and setting the SAV delay, PAV delay and/or V-V delay to the SAV delay, PAV delay and/or V-V delay that provides the minimum QRS_DUR<highlight><subscript>SAMPLE </subscript></highlight>value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> One manner of determining the values of the SAV delay, PAV delay, and/or V-V delay that provide a minimal QRS duration (QRS DURMIN) following delivery of the V-PACE<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is Illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. At this point, the first measured QRS_DUR<highlight><subscript>SAMPLE </subscript></highlight>value at the prevailing V-V delay, SAV delay and PAV delay has been stored in step S<highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>. Each of a series of QRS_DUR<highlight><subscript>SAMPLE </subscript></highlight>values that are measured after a change in one or more of the V-V delay, SAV delay, and PAV delay are compared with the preceding or prior measured QRS_DUR<highlight><subscript>SAMPLE </subscript></highlight>value to determine if the change has decreased the QRS duration. An additional change in the same direction (increasing or decreasing the parameter duration) is made if the prior change does decrease the QRS duration. If, however, the change results in an increase in the measured QRS duration, then the change direction is reversed to repeat the measurement of the QRS duration using the prior parameter value. Only one reversal in direction is allowed to inhibit &ldquo;hunting&rdquo; that could otherwise occur and cause the algorithm to repeat the dithering indefinitely. A rest period of a number of heart cycles or a time period is provided between each change in a V-V delay, SAV delay, and PAV delay parameter value to allow the heart to acclimate to the change. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Thus, in step S<highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> one or more of the SAV, PAV, and/or V-V delays are either incremented or decremented, the corresponding increment or decrement flag is set so that the direction of change (increase or decrease) is recorded, and a &ldquo;NO&rdquo; count is set to &ldquo;0&rdquo;. Next, the resting period is timed or counted in steps S<highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>. It will be understood that a physician may establish an incrementing and decrementing routine from the patient work-up in steps S<highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> to determine which of the parameters and combinations of parameters effect a change in the QRS duration in the particular patient. The physician may also program increment and decrement amounts and the length of the resting period of steps S<highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>. In another embodiment, the physician may also program the system to abort or continue the process after a delay if steps S<highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> or S<highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> are not satisfied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> At this point, steps S<highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight>-S<highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> are repeated per step S<highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> to derive a succeeding measured QRS<highlight><subscript>13 </subscript></highlight>DUR<highlight><subscript>SAMPLE </subscript></highlight>value at the decremented or incremented one or more of the V-V, SAV, and/or PAV delays that is can be stored in memory in step S<highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> to retain a record of the operation of the algorithm for retrieval and review by the physician in a subsequently initiated telemetry session. The succeeding measured QRS<highlight><subscript>13 </subscript></highlight>DUR<highlight><subscript>SAMPLE </subscript></highlight>value is compared to the prior measured QRS_DUR<highlight><subscript>SAMPLE </subscript></highlight>value in step S<highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>. If the succeeding measured QRS_DUR<highlight><subscript>SAMPLE </subscript></highlight>value is less than the prior measured QRS_DUR<highlight><subscript>SAMPLE </subscript></highlight>value, then the flag status is checked in step S<highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>. If the increment flag was set in step S<highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, and the increment has effected the favorable reduction in the QRS duration, then the one or more of the SAV delay and/or PAV delay and/or V-V delay that was incremented in step S<highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> is again incremented in step S<highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>. Similarly, if the decrement flag was set in step S<highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, and the decrement has effected the favorable reduction in the QRS duration, then the one or more of the SAV, PAV, and/or V-V delay that was decremented in step S<highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> is again decremented in step S<highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight>. The process of steps S<highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>-S<highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight> is then repeated to determine if the QRS duration can be further reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Returning to step S <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, if the succeeding measured QRS<highlight><subscript>13 </subscript></highlight>DUR<highlight><subscript>SAMPLE </subscript></highlight>value is greater than the prior measured QRS_DUR<highlight><subscript>SAMPLE </subscript></highlight>value, which can occur in the first pass through steps S<highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> through S<highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> or in subsequent passes through S<highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>-S<highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight>, then a change in direction is initiated. The &ldquo;NO&rdquo; count (set to &ldquo;0&rdquo; in step S<highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>) is tested in step S<highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight> and incremented to &ldquo;1&rdquo; in step S<highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>. The flag status is tested in step S<highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> to determine the prevailing direction of change, and the change in direction is effected in step S<highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight> or S<highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight>. Thus, if the one or more of the SAV, PAV, and/or V-V delays was decremented previously, then the direction is changed in step S<highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight> to increment the one or more of the SAV delay and/or PAV delay and/or V-V delay and to repeat steps S<highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>-S<highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> At some point, the succeeding measured QRS_DUR<highlight><subscript>SAMPLE </subscript></highlight>value is greater than the prior measured QRS_DUR<highlight><subscript>SAMPLE </subscript></highlight>value, and the condition of step S<highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight> is satisfied. Then, the prior measured QRS<highlight><subscript>13 </subscript></highlight>DUR<highlight><subscript>SAMPLE </subscript></highlight>value is declared the QRS_DUR<highlight><subscript>MIN </subscript></highlight>value, and it and the corresponding one or more of the SAV, PAV, and/or V-V delays are stored in RAM and employed in the operating system as described above with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 through 6</cross-reference>B until step S<highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> is repeated upon a trigger event satisfying step S<highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the incremented or decremented preceding value of the one or more of the SAV delay and/or PAV delay and/or V-V delay are stored in RAM and employed in the operating system as described above with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 through 6</cross-reference>B until step S<highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> is repeated upon a trigger event satisfying step S<highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> the first time the condition of step S<highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> is not satisfied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The physician can also enter programming commands that enable successive changes in each of the SAV delay, PAV delay and V-V delay to be tested pursuant to steps S<highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> S<highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight> and the above-described variants. Therefore, the next one of the synchronous pacing delays can be tested after a previous synchronous pacing delay has been derived by repeating steps S<highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>-S<highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight> pursuant to step S<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> until all of the delay values have been derived. In many clinical cases, only the optimal V-V delay in the RV-LV or LV-RV sequence would be obtained. In other clinical cases, the optimal SAV delay would be first obtained, and then the optimal V-V delay in the RV-LV or LV-RV sequence would be obtained. In certain clinical cases, the PAV delay would be automatically set to substantially the same value as the optimal SAV delay derived through executing any of the various combinations of steps S<highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>-S<highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight>. The order of the process and the tests included in the process can be left to the clinicians to develop for the particular patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The resulting values of the SAV delay, PAV delay and/or the V-V delay may be stored with the corresponding QRS_DUR<highlight><subscript>SAMPLE </subscript></highlight>data and the other related data in step S<highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight>. This data may be employed in the operating system depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 through 6</cross-reference>B until the event criteria are next satisfied. Therefore, in this aspect, the present invention can be employed to selectively derive the SAV, PAV, and/or the V-V delays that optimally minimizes the QRS duration over a period of weeks or months until the physician is able to analyze the stored data in step S<highlight><bold>428</bold></highlight>, and optionally perform steps S<highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> if deemed desirable. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> The preceding specific embodiments are directed to RV and LV pacing in a programmed RV-LV or LV-RV sequence. Such pacing is in response to the occurrence of a V-EVENT sensed in, or a V-PACE<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> delivered to, the RV or LV. However, it will be understood that the present invention also embraces locating first and second ventricular pace/sense electrodes in either the RV or LV separated apart from one another. In this case, the V-PACE<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and/or V-PACE<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are delivered in one of the VS/VP, VS/VP-VP, or VS-VP triggered pacing modes to the first and/or second ventricular pace/sense electrodes to provide for triggered pacing on a V-EVENT detected during the AV delay only. </paragraph>
