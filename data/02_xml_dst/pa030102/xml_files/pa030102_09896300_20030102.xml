<heading lvl="1">I&mdash;BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present utility model refers to a laminar spread for beds, transformable into a bathtub and its purpose is the protection of the bed where it is applied to allow the one using the same to take a bath, without necessity of being transferred for such end. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A great quantity of affections exist due to which it is not advisable to make the patient move outside of the bed in which the person is confined. There even are cases in which it is not even convenient to carry out movements inside the bed where the patient lies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Such is the situation present with certain type of wounds, bone problems, post-surgery, burns, etc. When some of these cases happen and the sick person should remain lying on a bed for a long time, the hygiene of the same becomes a problem since to do so the patient should be transferred up to the place where the corresponding bathtub is located. The alternatives are to carry out this transfer once the conditions of the patient allow it, or to make a superficial hygiene &ldquo;in situ.&rdquo; That is to say that, anyway, the permanent and thorough hygiene is affected by the condition of the one affected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> One of the resources to solve this problem consists in, as soon as the conditions allow it, to transfer the sick person using a canvas that is passed below the person&apos;s body and, maintaining said canvas stretched by its edges borders, it allows to transport the patient up to the bathtub. In other cases a not very thick frame on which a strongly tensed fabric mounts so that it does not yield with the weight of the body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The problem is that, in the case of the canvas, if the stretcher bearers do not maintain it extremely and constantly tight when being carried, traumatic disarrangements of the body can take place. In the case of the frame, the problem can take place when passing the body over the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> As alternative or complementary means of those already mentioned, different stretchers are used which allow to transfer the body between said stretcher and its adjacent area, or vice versa reducing close contacts or disarrangements that can be traumatic. Among these well-known stretchers there are units provided of beds including movable tracts, as well as beds that can be disassembled from the structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In most of the cases it is stretchers to which it has been tried to endow of the biggest possible versatility, with the purpose that they adapt to the different stages that compose the operation of transfer of a body. That is to say that they can be prepared appropriately for the quick displacement on different support planes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Contrary to all these means, the present utility model supplies a laminar spread whose employment does not require the patient&apos;s transfer to take a bath. Indeed, it is a laminar spread applicable as covering means on the application bed and that it can be transformed into a bathtub. It includes a square sheet provided, so much of longitudinal and traverse fold lines, as of oblique fold lines, among all which the lateral walls are defined. Against these last ones they are foldable and sustainable corresponding corner folds, including one of said lateral walls a means for supplying rigidity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> So much the longitudinal lateral walls as the bolsters are foldable around their respective fold lines, for what they can be elevated until they are erect, while the corner folds that are formed fix to the longitudinal walls by means of the respective means of positional support. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The presence of a rigid member on one of the borders, on the other hand, supplies support to the set arranged in this way, supplemented by its means of support. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> With this disposition the spread is transformed in a bathtub that, once the bath has been carried out, can be evacuated of liquid through the corresponding outlet mouth and exhaust tube. Finally the lateral walls are depressed being the sheet disposed as a spread. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">IV&mdash;DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In general terms, this utility model refers to a laminar spread (a) for beds (b) that is transformable into a bathtub and it includes a square sheet (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) provided, so much of longitudinal (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime;) and traverse (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&prime;) fold lines, as of oblique fold lines (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>), among all which the lateral walls (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>)(<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) are defined. Against the latter walls (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>)(<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) there are foldable and supportable corresponding corner folds (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>), one (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) of said lateral walls (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>)(<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) including a means for supplying rigidity (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>). &lsqb;see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> More particularly, the present laminar spread (a) includes a square sheet (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) constituted by a waterproof and flexible material. This square sheet (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) is defined by two longitudinal (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) and by two traverse (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) borders, which are parallel. &lsqb;see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Parallel to said longitudinal borders (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), the square sheet (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) presents two respective longitudinal fold lines (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime;) that extend along the complete length of the sheet (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) ending in the traverse borders (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>). In this way among each longitudinal fold line (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime;) and their proximal border (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) a respective longitudinal lateral wall is conformed (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>). Both longitudinal walls (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) this way conformed are foldable around their respective fold line (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime;). &lsqb;see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, also in the square sheet (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), but in parallel form respecting the traverse borders (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>), there are two traverse fold lines (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&prime;) that extend along the complete width of said sheet (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) so that they cross the longitudinal lines (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime;) to in the longitudinal borders (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). With this disposition, among each traverse fold line (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&prime;) and their proximal traverse border (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) a respective lateral bolster wall is conformed (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>). Both bolster walls (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) are foldable around the respective fold lines (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&prime;) that conform them. &lsqb;see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In each one of the four corners of the square sheet (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) there is a respective oblique fold line (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) that joins the intersection of the lines of longitudinal fold (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime;) and traverse (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&prime;) with the proximal corner. These oblique fold lines (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>), together with the corner tracts (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&Prime;) (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&Prime;) of the longitudinal fold (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime;) and traverse (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&prime;) lines, define corresponding corner folds (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>). &lsqb;see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> These corner folds (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>), on the other hand, are foldable against the longitudinal lateral wall (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) adjacent to each one of them (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>), on which they have means of positional support (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> ). Another way of embodiment has also been foreseen in the one on which the corner folds (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) are foldable against the respective lateral bolster walls (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) in which the means of positional support (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) are found. &lsqb;see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Together with this, said longitudinal (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime;) and traverse (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&prime;) fold lines, define a bottom (<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) of the spread (a) provided of a mouth (<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>) for the discharge of liquid. This discharge mouth (<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>) that counts with closing means, ends in an exhaust tube (<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>). &lsqb;see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In the described embodiment, the laminar spread (a) has a means for supplying rigidity of one (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) of the lateral walls (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>)(<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>), consistent in a rigid member (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) supportable to the lateral bolster wall (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>). This rigid member (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) is endowed with a means of support (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&prime;) against any support, just as a wall. Nevertheless other ways of embodiment have been foreseen in which the spread (a) has rigid members (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) in several or in all the borders (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>)(<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) of the square sheet (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). &lsqb;see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The set works in the following way: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The laminar spread (a) is disposed on the bed (b) of application, so that the reverse of their bottom (<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) supports against the base of said bed (b). &lsqb;see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</cross-reference>&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Under these conditions, if the longitudinal lateral walls rise (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>), their respective fold lines (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime;) allow their folding until the same (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) are completely erected with regard to the bottom (<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The same happens to the lateral bolster walls (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) that can be folded due to the presence of their respective traverse fold lines (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&prime;). &lsqb;see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Together with this, in each corner of the sheet (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), the presence of the oblique fold line (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) and of the corner tracts (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&Prime;) (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&Prime;) of the longitudinal (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime;) and traverse (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&prime;) lines, allows a folding of that section of the sheet (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), so that the foldable corner folds (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) are formed.
