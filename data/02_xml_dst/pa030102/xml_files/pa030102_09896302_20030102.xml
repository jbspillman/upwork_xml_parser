<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to the field of apparatus for exercising the human body. More particularly, the invention relates to an improved apparatus for use with a treadmill that provides a means for exercising against an elastomeric resistance, thereby strengthening the legs and the lower body, and increasing the legs&apos; turnover. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Human exercise on a regular basis is acknowledged to have many benefits. A large segment of the population prefers to exercise indoors for reasons of climate, personal convenience, shyness, etc. Athletes in training may also prefer to exercise indoors for reasons of climate and personal convenience. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The prior art has recognized the benefits of simulating indoors the benefits of exercise usually conducted out of doors, such as the cross-country skiing simulator as disclosed in the Norton U.S. Pat. No. 4,434,981; the running on stadium stairs for strengthening the legs and increasing cardiac output is simulated to a degree by the Wilkinson U. S. Pat. No. 4,340,218. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Rehabilitation or strengthening various leg joints of the body through use of elastomeric or spring resistance appears in the art such as the Segal U.S. Pat. No. 4,606,542 for exercising the legs or arms, the Hartzell U. S. Pat. No. 4,371,162 which simulates the weight lifters squats exercise, and Reese U.S. Pat. No. 4,466,613 for portable quadriceps muscles exerciser. Martinez U.S. Pat. No. 6,053,850 provides for a variable resistance exercise assembly that attaches to a shoulder harness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Exercise apparatus for use with treadmills also appear in the art. For example, Frappier U.S. Pat. No. 5,167,601 provides for a leg muscle training device wherein stationary resistance is provided by a person grasping a tether firmly, and Lee U.S. Pat. No. 6,123,649 provides for an apparatus attached to a treadmill, with a resistance means that attaches to the user&apos;s body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a simple and convenient apparatus that attaches easily to any treadmill device. When used in conjunction with the treadmill, the resistance is exerted directly to the user&apos;s legs, providing benefits similar to running in sand dunes or up stairs, namely increased leg strength, speed and thrust, as well as the overall endurance of the user. The addition of a flexible panel maintains the proper position and alignment of the user on the treadmill, provides a means to adjust the resistance exerted on the user, and provides a housing for the elastomeric member, thus preventing the elastomeric member from fluttering excessively. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION AND OBJECTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved exercising device that increases overall endurance and leg strength by applying resistance to the legs while engaging in running or walking movements. It is another object of the invention to increase the leg turnover rate, thereby increasing a user&apos;s running speed, through the application of resistance to the legs while engaging in running or walking movements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the invention to provide an exercising device which may be used indoors with all commonly available treadmill devices, wherein the device is simple to manufacture and use, efficient in operation, disassembles easily for storage, is easy to erect for use in exercising. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> These and other objects of the invention are realized by providing an resistance exercise apparatus to be used in conjunction with a belt driven treadmill, and includes a base that attaches to the treadmill and having a vertical strut positioned to be behind the user, with an elastomeric member yieldable to resist motions of the legs that is secured to the strut and is mountable on the user&apos;s legs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A tether member that attaches to the user by means of a waist belt and extending to the strut defines the position and alignment of the user on the treadmill, and provides a means to adjust the resistance exerted on the user. A panel of flexible material houses the elastomeric member and further defines the position and alignment of the user on the treadmill. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Other objects, advantages and features of the invention become apparent from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment, reference being made to the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The exercise apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> of the drawings associated with a user <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> attaches to a treadmill <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and is positioned behind the user <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> substantially medially of the driven treadmill belt <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The apparatus includes a base <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>; at least one vertical strut <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> extending upwardly from the base <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>; a waist belt <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> mountable around the user&apos;s waist; a tether <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> that extends between the waist belt <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the vertical strut <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>; and an elastomeric member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> secured to the vertical strut <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, which engages with the user&apos;s legs by means of collars <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, a panel <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> having a pocket <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> along the lower portion is attached to the vertical strut <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> at multiple points. The pocket <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> houses the elastomeric member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, while the upper portion of the panel <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> extends between the tether <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the upper portion of the vertical strut <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The panel <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is substantially trapezoid in shape, and is made of substantially non-elastic, flexible material such as canvas or nylon fabric. Preferably the panel has means to releasably attach to the vertical strut <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Besides housing the elastomeric member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the panel defines the position and alignment of the user on the treadmill in relation to the invention. Further, it serves to prevent the elastomeric member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> from fluttering excessively during use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The tether <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is made of substantially non-elastic material such as woven canvas webbing, and may have means to adjust its length. Shortening the tether length will decrease the resistance exerted on the user, while lengthening the tether length will increase the resistance exerted on the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The elastomeric member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be selected from various materials, including bungie cords, bicycle tire inner tubes, rubber straps and the like. The elastomeric member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is attached to the leg collars <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> by means of a v-shaped webbing <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, and includes means to attach to the vertical strut <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The means to attach to the vertical strut is preferably a loop <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> that secures to a hook on the vertical strut <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> leg collar <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is mountable about the user&apos;s thigh and is comprised of a layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of substantially non-elastic material, said layer further comprising a plurality of flexible loops <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> protruding from the external side of the layer, an elastic layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> attached to the internal side of the non-elastic layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and fastening means to secure the collar around the user&apos;s thigh. When the collar is secured around the user&apos;s leg, the elastic layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> will be in contact with the user, and the loops <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> will flatten to provide a firm grip to the leg. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the collar fastening means refers to a hook and loop type fastener attached to the one end of the non-elastic layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, that threads through a buckle <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The base <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, comprises a rear support <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> from which the vertical strut <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> extends upwardly, a left support or arm <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and a right support or arm <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> that are joined to the rear support. Both left and right supports are preferably L-shaped in lateral cross-section, and have means to releasably attach to the treadmill such as releasable clamps <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The left and right supports <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> unite with the rear support <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, to form a substantially u-shaped base with engagement means to achieve an adjustable or variable width to accommodate varied treadmill widths. Preferably, the support engagement means comprises multiple apertures bored through the left support <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the right support <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, and the rear support <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, and fasteners. Preferably the fasteners are threaded bolts and nuts, but other fasteners such as cotter pins can be used, as well as other means to achieve adjustable width. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The base <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may also include means to stabilize the left and right supports <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Preferably, the means to stabilize the left and right supports <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> comprises a threaded rod <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. The threaded rod <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> extends between the left support <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and right support <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. The threaded rod <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> fits into apertures bored through the left support <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the right support <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, and is securely fastened by means of a nut <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The threaded rod <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> prevents the distortion or breaking of the left and right supports <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> that may be caused by the force exerted by the releasable clamps <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The vertical strut <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may include loop <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> that is secured to the top of the strut. The loop serves as an attachment point for the upper portion of the panel <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The vertical strut may have other loops or hooks along its length that serve as attachment points for the panel <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The above apparatus can be used in the following methods. The apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is secured to a treadmill <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> such as by the clamps <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, so that the base <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> rests on the ground, floor or other support surface, and is arranged to extend behind the user <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and to the rear of the treadmill <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The user <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> secures the waist belt <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> about the user&apos;s waist, and secures each leg collar <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> about the thigh of the user&apos;s legs. User moves his legs in a running or walking motion on the treadmill as the treadmill is set into operation. The elastomeric member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> stretches from the force of the user&apos;s motion and exerts resistance on the user&apos;s legs. The application of resistance to the user&apos;s legs may have the effect of strengthening the user&apos;s legs and lower body. The application of resistance to the user&apos;s legs may also increase the user&apos;s leg turnover rate, thereby increasing the user&apos;s running speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> As previously explained, shortening the length of tether <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> will decrease the resistance exerted on the user, while lengthening the length of tether <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> will increase the resistance exerted on the user. The resistance exerted on the user can also be adjusted by lengthening or shortening the left support <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and right support <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of the base <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> with respect to the end of the treadmill. It is understood that while adjusting the distance the base <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> extends behind the treadmill will modify the resistance exerted on the user, adjusting the length of the tether <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> provides a finer and quicker means for modifying the resistance exerted on the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> It will be clear from the above that there has been described an improved apparatus which fulfills the purposes and objects of the invention, but it is to be understood that the form of the invention shown and described is to be taken as merely a preferred embodiment and various changes in shape, material, size and arrangement of the parts may be resorted to without departing from the spirit of the invention of scope of the claims which follow: </paragraph>
