<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to data storage devices, or disk drives, for recording digital information on or reading digital information from a flexible magnetic media, which is disposed within a cartridge shell, and more particularly, to an apparatus to prevent misthreading of the media during insertion into the disk drive. </paragraph>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Microprocessors and supporting computer technologies are rapidly increasing in speed and computing power while decreasing in cost and size. These factors have led to the broad application of microprocessors to an array of electronic products, such as hand-held computers, digital cameras, cellular phones and the like. All of these devices have, in effect, become computers with particular application-specific attributes. For this new breed of computer products, enormous flexibility is gained by the ability to exchange data files and store computer software. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A variety of proprietary storage devices have been used in computer products. For example, hand-held computers have used integrated circuit memory cards (&ldquo;memory cards&rdquo;) as the primary information storage media. Memory cards include memory storage elements, such as static random access memory (SRAM), or programmable and erasable non-volatile memory, such as &ldquo;flash&rdquo; memory. Memory cards each typically are the size of a conventional credit card and are used in portable computers in place of hard disk drives and floppy disk drives. Furthermore, memory cards enhance the significant advantages of the size, weight, and battery lifetime attributes of the portable computer and increase portability of the storage media. Because of the limited memory density attainable in each memory card, however, and the high cost of the specialized memory chips, using memory cards in hand-held computers imposes limitations not encountered in less portable computers such as conventional personal computers, which typically use more power-consuming and heavier hard and/or floppy disk drives as their primary storage data device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> More portable computer products, such as the digital camera, have employed miniature video disks as the storage media. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,553,175, which issued Nov. 12, 1985 to Baumeister, discloses a digital camera configured to store information on a magnetic disk. In Baumeister, a signal processor receives signals representative of a picture from a photo sensor. Those signals are recorded on a magnetic disk for later processing. Unfortunately, the video disk storage product provides limited storage capacity. For that and other reasons such as power consumption and cost, the video disk has not been used in other computer products. As a result, interchanging data from one of these digital cameras with other computer products, such as a hand-held computer, is not readily achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Miniature hard disk drives also have been suggested for use in portable computer products. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,469,314, which issued Nov. 21, 1995 to Morehouse et al., discloses a miniature hard drive for use in portable computer applications. In Morehouse, a hard disk drive is described that is approximately 50 mm in diameter. While addressing many of the problems presented by storage requirements in portable computers, the obvious problem of removability of the storage media remained present. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Similar to a standard size cartridge, a miniature cartridge contains a flexible magnetic disk (or media) disposed within a hard outer shell. Such a standard size cartridge is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,445,157 (Takahashi). The Takahashi patent generally is directed to a disk cassette that contains a flexible magnetic disk having a center core, i.e., a hub, and an apparatus for reading digital information from and recording digital information on the flexible magnetic disk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Apparatus for reading digital information from and recording digital information on flexible magnetic media, or disk drives, often employ rotary actuators for positioning read/write heads of the disk drive over the surfaces of the storage media, which rotates about its hub. Rotary actuator assemblies (or rotary assemblies or head stacking assemblies (HSA&apos;s)) are used to carry the heads for magnetic disk drives, CD players, and optical drive devices. A rotary assembly has a pivot on bearings about which the actuator rotates to position the heads onto the desired track of the rotating storage media. An exemplary cartridge load and eject mechanism for a drive having such a rotary assembly is disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 6,055,125, which issued Apr. 25, 2000, to Muse et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6,055,125 is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The relatively small size of disk drive bays found in laptop and notebook computers, and smaller devices such as digital cameras, can place significant constraints on the designer of internal disk drives for use in such computers. Techniques that address and overcome the problems associated with these size constraints are therefore important. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A top plan view of an exemplary disk drive is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the disk drive comprises a rotary actuator assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a pivot <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> about which the actuator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> rotates and the platform <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> on which the storage media rests. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows an enlarged cross-sectional view of the disk drive of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> across line II-II. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the disk drive also contains a load ramp <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, which is known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a top plan view of the disk drive of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> when the rotary actuator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is parked or situated on the load ramp <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The actuator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is in this position when the actuator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is not accessing data from or recording data on the flexible media. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows an enlarged cross-sectional view of the disk drive of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> across line IV-IV. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the rotary actuator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is positioned (or &ldquo;parked&rdquo;) in back of the load ramp <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (away from the media). Also, the rotary actuator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has two arms <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, which serve as a suspension for the read/write heads, which themselves are situated on the distal ends of the arms <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> As also shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, the load ramp <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has two ramp-shaped halves <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. This load ramp <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is referred to as a scissors-type load ramp. When the actuator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is rotating away from the flexible storage media to its parked position, the halves <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the load ramp <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are in a closed position, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. When the actuator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is rotating into its parked position, the upper arm <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the actuator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is guided over the upper half <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the load ramp <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Similarly, the lower arm <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the actuator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is guided under the lower half <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the load ramp <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> When the rotary actuator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is in its parked position, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the halves <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of load ramp are in an open position. When a disk cartridge is inserted into the drive, it is designed such that the flexible media threads between the halves <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the load ramp <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, as they are positioned as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> During insertion of the cartridge, however, a problem can arise when the media misthreads below the lower half <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the ramp <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. This problem presents a minor failure in that every time it occurs, the user must eject the cartridge and reinsert it because in the misthreaded state, the drive cannot read from or record to the media. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Additionally, misthreading presents a major failure in that if the media misthreads, the heads of the actuator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can stick together. Further, in some cases when the heads stick together and as the actuator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> rotates toward its parked position, the arms <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the actuator become stuck between the halves <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the load ramp <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, i.e., instead of riding on the outside of the ramp <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. When this happens, the cartridge-eject mechanism in some disk drives cannot operate. At that point, the drive must be serviced to remove the cartridge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> It is, therefore, desirable to provide a disk drive that prevents misthreading of the flexible magnetic media during insertion into the disk drive. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Referring to the drawings, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a top plan view of the disk drive of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> in conjunction with a threader <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> according to the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows an enlarged cross-sectional view of the disk drive of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> in cooperation with a threader <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> according to the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows a top plan view of the disk drive of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> when the rotary actuator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is parked. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows an enlarged cross-sectional view of the disk drive of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> across line VIII-VIII. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the threader <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is a pliable (or compliant) element or piece of material that is attached only at the ends <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, i.e., having a hollow underside <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>u </italic></highlight>(<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>). Mylar&trade; is the preferred material, and more preferably, Mylar&trade; having a thickness of 0.05 mm. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 8</cross-reference>, the threader <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> preferably is ramp-shaped. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 7</cross-reference>, the threader preferably has a rectangular or square shape in a top plan view. For a disk drive having a media of approximately 46 mm. in diameter, a preferred height of a threader is in the range of approximately 0.5 mm. and approximately 1.5 mm., and more preferably is approximately 0.75 mm. In addition, the size of a preferred threader for such a disk drive is approximately 4 mm. by 4 mm. Further, the level of compliance for a preferred threader is sufficient to guide the disk without causing damage to either the disk or the actuator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, when the actuator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is parked and the media is inserted into the drive, the threader <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> has a height greater than that of the lower half <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the load ramp <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Thus, the threader <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> prevents the media from misthreading by guiding the media between the two halves <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the load ramp <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In this way, the threader <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> does not permit the media to pass below the lower half <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the load ramp <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In this case the media is more compliant then the threader <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and the media will bend up the ramp of the threader <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to thread between the two halves <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the load ramp. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As the actuator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> moves from a parked position and begins to load onto the media, the upper and lower halves <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the load ramp <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> pivot about the load ramp pin and move closer to the media. The tip of the lower half of the load ramp <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> moves from a position below the threader <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>) to a position above the threader <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>). This creates space between the lower half of the load ramp <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the threader <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to allow the lower arm of the actuator <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to pass between the two. The threader <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is sufficiently compliant so that as the actuator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> moves from a parked position onto the media, if the lower arm <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the actuator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> hits the threader <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the arm <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> will move the threader <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> out of the way without damaging the arm <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. It is important to protect the actuator arms <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> because if they are damaged it will hinder the reading and writing capability of the drive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> It is to be understood that even though numerous characteristics and advantages of the present invention have been set forth in the foregoing description, together with details of the structure and function of the invention, the disclosure is illustrative only. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, changes may be made in detail, especially in matters of shape, size and arrangement of parts within the principles of the invention to the full extent indicated by the broad general meaning of the terms in which the appended claims are expressed. </paragraph>
