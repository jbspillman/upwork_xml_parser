<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">An inlet to a disc drive&apos;s filter chamber is tapered to converge along most or all of its length so as to reduce drag and increase inflow volume and velocity. This accelerates the removal of particles from the disc drive&apos;s sealed chamber, reducing the likelihood of particle-induced data transfer errors or media damage. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This application relates generally to removing stray particles from a disc drive and more particularly to controlling a flow through a particle filter so as to remove particles more quickly. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Disc drive machines record and reproduce information on a recording media. The media generally takes the form of circular information storage discs having a multiplicity of concentric tracks. Conventional hard disc drives include a disc pack holding a plurality of vertically aligned rotating information storage discs, each surface of which has an associated magnetic head that is adapted to transfer information between the disc and an external system. An elongated flexure arm supports each head so that the head flies a small distance from its respective data storage surface. The rotation of the discs creates an air bearing that controls fly height. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> It is extremely important to the operation of the disc drive to quickly establish and maintain a dust free environment within the drive. Fly heights are very small, typically 0.5 microinches or less. A disc drive typically contains many particles much larger than this, at least initially. These particles can cause read or write errors, and can even damage the data surfaces or the heads. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> To prevent dust particles from entering into the drive it is important to thoroughly filter any air that enters the drive from the outside. Drives are typically vented to the outside only through a breather filter that very efficiently filters dust particles from any air passing therethrough. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is also important to limit the number of particles generated inside the drive. Unfortunately, some of the actions that generate particles are unavoidable. At present, the principal source of dust within the drive is microparticles that flake off of the parking surfaces when the drive is started and stopped. Other parts that rub during operation can cause dust particles as well. Therefore, it is necessary to provide effective internal particle filtering. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> For improved performance, Seagate engineers have been working to reduce &ldquo;cleanup time,&rdquo; the time needed for a particle filter to remove substantially all of the dust particles suspended in the air inside a disc drive. Until recently, most of this effort has been confined to improving the quality of particle filters, not appreciating the importance of optimizing air flow through them. It is to this shortcoming that the present invention is directed. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> As with a conventional disc drive, the present invention includes an aperture for receiving gas flow from a rotatable disc stack within a sealed housing. To accelerate the filtering of particles, a disc drive of the present invention includes a means for receiving an initial flow and for providing to the chamber a modified flow at a higher flow rate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In a typical embodiment, this is accomplished by a tapered channel having inner and outer opposing walls. For specificity, many features of the channel are defined with respect to a fastest-flow path passing between these walls, with the disc drive operating under nominal conditions. The path extends beyond an inlet and an outlet of the channel, both of which are defined as closed planar cross sections having a solid circumference. The inlet is defined as an upstream-most closed planar cross section orthogonal to the path. The outlet is similarly defined as a downstream-most smallest-area planar cross section orthogonal to the path. The channel contains exactly one cross-section orthogonal to the path for each corresponding point on the path. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Preferably, at least &frac23; of the length of the channel is substantially converging (i.e. having a cross sectional area that decreases at least 0.1% for each advance of R/100, where R is the nominal disc radius). Next, a shorter &ldquo;conduit&rdquo; that is substantially uniform passes the flow into the chamber. As a result of these features, under normal operating conditions, the average pressure in the filter chamber is significantly higher than that of the entire sealed chamber, significantly reducing the disc drive&apos;s cleanup time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Additional features and benefits will become apparent upon a review of the following drawings and the corresponding detailed description.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Referring to the drawings in general, and more particularly to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, shown there is a disc drive <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> configured to implement the present invention. Disc drive <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a housing <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> containing several discs <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> in a stack arranged for co-rotation in a conventional manner. Preferably, the discs <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> are each at least 50 mils thick to minimize the flutter that can result from having gaps in the shroud circumscribing the disc stack. The cover <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is configured to engage with the housing to provide a conventional sealed chamber. The chamber is sealed to resist the introduction of contaminants. The top and bottom flat surfaces of each disc <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> each include many thousands of circular tracks <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> containing data. A rotary actuator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> supports several transducer heads <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> each supported on a respective arm adjacent a respective surface of a disc <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. A conventional voice coil motor (comprising at least one magnet <highlight><bold>177</bold></highlight> and at least one voice coil <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>) controls the position of the actuator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> so that a selected one of the heads <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is positioned on its arc <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> adjacent a selected track <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>. Once the head <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is following the selected track <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>, data can be retrieved from or written to the track <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> via a flex connector <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> through which data signals flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> A spindle motor <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> causes the discs <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> to spin, counterclockwise as shown, at a tightly-controlled nominal frequency of several thousand revolutions per minute. This causes a wind of hundreds of feet per second to be carried along all about the circumference of discs. At the same time, head <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> flies a very small distance (less than 1 microinch) above its respective disc <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. This fly height must be small enough for strong magnetic interactions, but large enough to prevent damaging collisions. As it turns out, this distance is small enough that dust particles play a very significant role. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> To reduce the number of dust particles, a particle filter <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> is positioned to permit air to flow through it whenever the disc stack spins. According to the present invention, a tapered inlet is provided to increase the amount of air that will enter the filter chamber, which in turn increases the amount of air that flows through the chamber. The height <highlight><bold>183</bold></highlight> of the sealed chamber is also shown. For present purposes, it can be assumed that all open portions of the sealed chamber of all disc drives have this uniform height. Lengths and widths of items shown are therefore also representative of vertical cross-sectional areas. This is especially significant in the description of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a top view of a disc drive <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> with a filter/chamber/inlet configuration of the prior art, drawn to scale. Particle-capturing filter <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> is supported between opposing C-shaped gaps on the housing <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. One of the C-shaped gaps is on a column <highlight><bold>289</bold></highlight> of the housing that extends to contact the cover (not shown) of the disc drive <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The corner of the disc drive <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> shown is essentially uniform throughout the height of the chamber <highlight><bold>279</bold></highlight> and channel. For present purposes the dimensions are height-normalized so that the widths as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> directly represent the cross-sections of each depicted item. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> As discs <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> spin in direction <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>, air enters the filter chamber <highlight><bold>279</bold></highlight> through a channel having a substantially converging portion <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> and a substantially uniform portion <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. Filter <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> forms one side of chamber <highlight><bold>279</bold></highlight>, so that all air flowing into chamber <highlight><bold>279</bold></highlight> flows out through filter <highlight><bold>279</bold></highlight>. The channel has an inlet <highlight><bold>291</bold></highlight> and an outlet <highlight><bold>292</bold></highlight> that are both planar and substantially vertical. For specificity, the inlet <highlight><bold>291</bold></highlight> is defined so that its point <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> of fastest flow has a flow direction that is perpendicular to the inlet <highlight><bold>291</bold></highlight>, and that the inlet is the leftmost (upstream-most) cross section having a closed boundary. The outlet <highlight><bold>292</bold></highlight> is similarly defined so that its point <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> of fastest flow has a flow direction that is perpendicular to the outlet <highlight><bold>292</bold></highlight>. Connecting the points <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> of fastest flow is a path <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> of fastest flow. Each point on path <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> downstream from inlet <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> has a corresponding cross-section of the channel which has a corresponding area. Outlet <highlight><bold>292</bold></highlight> is further defined so that the area is equal to the minimum of these areas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Note that the boundary of the inlet <highlight><bold>291</bold></highlight> intersects inner and outer walls <highlight><bold>281</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight> that extend along the channel. Note also that &ldquo;substantially uniform&rdquo; portion <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is so named because its cross-sectional area (perpendicular to path <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>) varies by less than 0.1%, as measured by planes at any two points separated along the path <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> by exactly R/1000, R being the nominal radius of the discs <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. As used herein, similarly, a &ldquo;substantially&rdquo; converging or diverging portion such as <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> is one having a cross section that decreases too significantly, over too long a downstream or upstream path, to qualify as &ldquo;substantially uniform.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a portion of another disc drive <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> of the prior art, including a particle-capturing filter <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight>. Discs <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> having a nominal radius <highlight><bold>385</bold></highlight> rotate counterclockwise <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> about axis <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight>, permitting heads <highlight><bold>376</bold></highlight> to fly adjacent corresponding surfaces of discs <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>. (In the disc drive arts, note that the &ldquo;vertical&rdquo; direction is conventionally defined by the axis <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> of the disc stack, not by the planet&apos;s center). A series of time-averaged maximum flow points <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>337</bold></highlight> is shown. Note that the channel is bounded by an inlet <highlight><bold>391</bold></highlight> and an outlet <highlight><bold>392</bold></highlight>, and that points <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> are within substantially divergent parts of the channel. Interleaved therewith are three substantially convergent parts <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> of the channel. As with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is drawn to scale. Vertical surfaces shown therein are essentially uniform and essentially extend between a flat floor and a flat ceiling. A close examination of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> will thus reveal that along an estimated fastest-flow path connecting the reference points <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>337</bold></highlight>, less than &frac23; of the length of the channel is within a substantially converging portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> As used here and consistent with industry usage, &ldquo;substantially convergent&rdquo; refers to a portion of a channel or conduit having a cross section that decreases at least 0.1% for each advance of R/100 along the fastest-flow path, where R is the nominal radius of a disc in the stack. A conduit is &ldquo;substantially uniform&rdquo; if it is neither substantially convergent nor substantially divergent. Note that a conduit may thus be &ldquo;substantially uniform&rdquo; even if it is textured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Concerning <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 &amp; 3</cross-reference>, note that the described features concerning the maximum flow path, perpendicular cross sections, and convergent portions of channels are not conventionally referenced or known in the art. Rather, the drives <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> themselves are in public use. The features described above are inherent in these prior art designs, however, these inherent features are useful in contrasting designs of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows a portion of a disc drive <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> of the present invention. Disc drive <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> includes a sealed housing <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> containing air. A stack of one or more discs <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> having a nominal radius <highlight><bold>485</bold></highlight> rotate counterclockwise <highlight><bold>428</bold></highlight> at a nominal frequency about axis <highlight><bold>425</bold></highlight> using means like those of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. As a result, air flows into a flow-directing channel <highlight><bold>474</bold></highlight> having inner and outer opposing walls <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> and a curvilinear fastest-flow path <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> passing therebetween. The channel <highlight><bold>474</bold></highlight> is bounded by an inlet <highlight><bold>491</bold></highlight>, an outlet <highlight><bold>492</bold></highlight>, vertical walls <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight>, and a horizontal ceiling and floor. Inlet <highlight><bold>491</bold></highlight> is defined as the upstream-most closed cross section orthogonal to path <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>. Outlet <highlight><bold>492</bold></highlight> is defined as the downstream-most smallest-area cross section orthogonal to path <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Channel <highlight><bold>474</bold></highlight> contains exactly one cross-section orthogonal to the path for each corresponding point on the path, the channel having a length along the path bounded by inlet <highlight><bold>491</bold></highlight> and outlet <highlight><bold>492</bold></highlight>. Unlike any conventional disc drives, at least &frac23; of the length is within a substantially convergent portion <highlight><bold>475</bold></highlight> of the channel <highlight><bold>474</bold></highlight>. (Note that the convergent portion <highlight><bold>475</bold></highlight> is 100% of the channel, in the example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Because of this convergence, chamber <highlight><bold>479</bold></highlight> receives more air from channel <highlight><bold>474</bold></highlight> than a similarly constructed design of the prior art. The volume-averaged air pressure in chamber <highlight><bold>479</bold></highlight> is at least 5% to 50% higher than the volume-averaged air pressure within the entire disc drive cavity within housing <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. (All gas pressures mentioned in this document are absolute pressures, not gauge pressures.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment as shown, to scale, particle-capturing filter <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> has a width <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight> at least 20% to 50% of the nominal radius <highlight><bold>485</bold></highlight> (R). Additionally, the gap between the downstream side of the filter <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> and the discs <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> has a smallest-area cross-section <highlight><bold>445</bold></highlight> that is entirely within a horizontal distance <highlight><bold>447</bold></highlight> of the discs <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> that is less than 5% to 50% of R. Because the cross-section <highlight><bold>445</bold></highlight> has a width greater than 10% to 50% of R, also, the &ldquo;fastest flow&rdquo; path of the filter outlet gap has no special importance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, there is shown a greatly magnified view of a circular portion <highlight><bold>499</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The widths of several cross sections <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>509</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> are shown, all in planes perpendicular to fastest-flow path <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>. The leftmost cross section <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is constructed as far to the left as possible, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, while being closed by inner wall <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight>. Cross section <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> thus is identical to inlet <highlight><bold>491</bold></highlight>. Each cross section is separated from its successor along path <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> by exactly R/100. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> A single-disc implementation of the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4&amp;5</cross-reference>, Seagate&apos;s &ldquo;Snowmass&rdquo; product, has an actual nominal rotation rate of 7200 rotations per minute. By replacing a prior design with a tapered inlet design substantially as shown, the cleanup time was reduced by more than 20%. More particularly, the operating time until substantially all of the particles in the size range of 0.09 to 0.20 microns were eliminated was reduced from 23 seconds to 18 seconds. For modern disc drives with heads that fly about 0.5 microinches or less above the disc, this is a meaningful risk reduction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows a plot of widths <highlight><bold>698</bold></highlight> versus position <highlight><bold>697</bold></highlight>, both tick-marked in accurate increments of R/100.

Cross sectional area <highlight><bold>618</bold></highlight> is also plotted vertically, in areal units scaled so that each cross section has a width and area point exactly overlaid. Note that this assumes a constant channel and chamber height, which is graphically helpful but not fundamental to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Note that at the inlet (where position&equals;0), width has its maximum finite value. To the left of the inlet <highlight><bold>491</bold></highlight>, width is infinite. Moving downstream, cross sectional area <highlight><bold>618</bold></highlight> decreases steadily to a minimum value <highlight><bold>650</bold></highlight>, defining the channel outlet <highlight><bold>492</bold></highlight> at position <highlight><bold>651</bold></highlight>. A small distance to the right of cross section <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>, cross sectional area <highlight><bold>618</bold></highlight> jumps to a very large value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Alternatively characterized, a first embodiment of the present invention is a disc drive (such as <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) that includes a sealed housing (such as <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>), a rotatable stack of discs (such as <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>), and a chamber adjacent a particle filter (such as <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>). The chamber is configured to receive a gas flow through a channel (such as <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>474</bold></highlight>) that converges along most or all of its length. The chamber has a volume-averaged gas pressure last least 5% larger than that of the sealed housing. In this preferred embodiment, the chamber has a larger volume than that of the channel, and the filter is wider than R/10, where R is the nominal radius of a disc (such as <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>) in the stack. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In a second embodiment, the channel has inner and outer opposing walls (such as <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight>) and a curvilinear fastest-flow path (such as <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>) passing between them. The path extends beyond an inlet and an outlet of the channel. For specificity, the inlet (such as <highlight><bold>491</bold></highlight>) is defined as an upstream-most closed planar cross section orthogonal to the path. The outlet (such as <highlight><bold>492</bold></highlight>) is similarly defined as a downstream-most smallest-area planar cross section orthogonal to the path. The channel contains exactly one cross-section orthogonal to the path for each corresponding point on the path. The channel has a length along the path bounded by the inlet and the outlet. The length is between 5% and 20% of R. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In a third embodiment, the inlet (such as <highlight><bold>491</bold></highlight>) is a planar cross section configured to receive from the disc stack an initial flow characterized by V1, where V1 is a volume flow rate across the cross section. The initial flow is received into a means (such as channel <highlight><bold>474</bold></highlight>) for receiving the initial flow and for providing to a filter chamber (such as <highlight><bold>479</bold></highlight>) a modified flow characterized by V2&gt;V1, where is a volume flow rate of the modified flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In a fourth embodiment, a continuously converging portion (such as <highlight><bold>571</bold></highlight>) of the channel contains at least &frac23; of the channel&apos;s length (i.e. along the fastest-flow path). The portion contains a series of several cross sectional areas (such as <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>) each orthogonal to the path and defining successive pairs of the areas. Each of the successive pairs is separated by a distance along the path of R/100. Each of the successive pairs consists of a downstream one A<highlight><subscript>i&plus;1 </subscript></highlight>and an upstream one A<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>. The portion converges steadily enough so that 0.80&lt;(A<highlight><subscript>i&plus;1</subscript></highlight>/A<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>)&lt;0.99 for each of the successive pairs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In a fifth embodiment, the narrowest portion of the channel/filter combination occurs at one nominally uniform, contiguous conduit that overlaps the channel and the chamber. The conduit has a nominal cross section and two ends, the ends each abutting a respective region having a larger-than-nominal cross section. To promote laminar flow while minimizing drag, the conduit having a length between 1% and 5% of R. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In a sixth embodiment, reference is made to the volume-averaged, time-averaged flow speed that is an inherent attribute of the chamber and of the channel. In this preferred embodiment, this flow speed is greater for the channel than for the chamber. As a result of this flow speed increase, the stagnation pressure within the filter chamber increases non-linearly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> It will be clear that the present invention is well adapted to attain the ends and advantages mentioned as well as those inherent therein. While a presently preferred embodiment has been described for purposes of this disclosure, various changes and modifications may be made which are well within the scope of the present invention. For example, while the various embodiments of the present invention have been described with respect to a disc drive, the present invention is also applicable to, and may be implemented in, other data storage devices such as optical disc drives and magneto-optical disc drives. Numerous other changes may be made which will readily suggest themselves to those skilled in the art and which are encompassed in the spirit of the invention disclosed and as defined in the appended claims. </paragraph>
