<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to the field of vehicles, and, more particularly, to vehicle security systems. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Vehicle security systems are widely used to deter vehicle theft, prevent theft of valuables from a vehicle, deter vandalism, and to protect vehicle owners and occupants. A typical automobile security system, for example, includes a central processor or controller connected to a plurality of vehicle sensors. The sensors, for example, may detect opening of the trunk, hood, doors, windows, and also movement of the vehicle or within the vehicle when the security system is armed. Ultrasonic and microwave motion detectors, vibration sensors, sound discriminators, differential pressure sensors, and switches may be used as sensors. In addition, radar sensors may be used to monitor the area proximate the vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The controller typically operates to give an alarm indication in the event of triggering of a vehicle sensor. The alarm indication may typically be a flashing of the lights and/or the sounding of the vehicle horn or a siren. In addition, the vehicle fuel supply and/or ignition power may be selectively disabled based upon an alarm condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A typical security system also includes a receiver associated with the controller that cooperates with one or more remote transmitters typically carried by the user as disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,383,242 to Sassover et al. The remote transmitter may be used to arm and disarm the vehicle security system or provide other remote control features from a predetermined range away from the vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Such vehicle security systems may confirm to the user that a signal from the remote transmitter has been received by the controller at the vehicle. For example, the controller may cause the vehicle&apos;s parking lights to blink and/or cause the horn or siren to sound to confirm receipt of the signal. An example of such a system is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,028,505 to Drori. Moreover, such vehicle systems may also be used in vehicles with power door locks to operate the power door locks based upon the remote transmitter. In such cases, this signal confirmation technique may similarly be used to verify that a lock or unlock signal has been received from the remote transmitter, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> One limitation of such prior art systems is that the visual confirmation indication provided by typical vehicle light bulbs may not be bright enough for the user to easily distinguish. This may be particularly true if the user has walked some distance from the vehicle before using the remote transmitter. Further, the user may not wish to have a sound generated as a confirmation indication. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In view of the foregoing background, it is therefore an object of the invention to provide a vehicle security system that provides improved visual confirmation indications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> This and other objects, features, and advantages in accordance with the present invention are provided by a vehicle security system for a vehicle including at least one vehicle light bulb and a light indicator circuit for providing power thereto. The vehicle security system may include at least one vehicle sensor, a remote transmitter to be carried by a user, and a controller positioned in the vehicle and electrically connected to the light indicator circuit. The controller may be switchable to at least one of an armed mode and a disarmed mode based upon the remote transmitter, and the controller may cause the light indicator circuit to selectively supply power to the at least one vehicle light bulb upon switching to at least one of the armed and disarmed modes. In the armed mode, the controller may generate an alarm indication responsive to the at least one vehicle sensor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the vehicle security system may also include a strobe light device at the vehicle and electrically connected to the light indicator circuit for providing a confirmation indication to the user that the controller has been switched to at least one of the armed and disarmed modes. This may be done based upon at least one of a leading edge and a trailing of the power supplied by the light indicator circuit to the at least one vehicle light bulb. Also, the confirmation indication may have a duration less than a duration of the selectively supplied power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> More particularly, the strobe light device may provide the confirmation indication for a predetermined duration. The vehicle may also include at least one vehicle light bulb connector electrically connected to the light indicator circuit, and the strobe light device may be electrically connected to the light indicator circuit via the at least one vehicle light bulb connector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The strobe light device may include a strobe connector electrically connected to the at least one vehicle light bulb connector, a strobe light bulb carried by the strobe connector, and a control circuit for receiving power and causing the strobe light bulb to provide the confirmation indication. More specifically, the control circuit may include at least one capacitor for storing and discharging power. Additionally, the at least one vehicle light bulb connector may be a socket, and the strobe connector may be a plug for mating with the socket. For example, the socket may be a parking light bulb socket. The strobe light device may also include a light bulb connector carried by the strobe connector, and the at least one vehicle light bulb may be carried by the light bulb connector. Moreover, the strobe light bulb may have a greater luminosity than the at least one vehicle light bulb. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the vehicle may also include power door locks, and the controller may selectively operate the power door locks based upon the remote transmitter. Accordingly, the strobe light device may provide the confirmation indication to the user to indicate that the controller has selectively operated the power door locks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> A method aspect of the invention is for operating a vehicle security system for use with a vehicle comprising at least one vehicle light bulb and a light indicator circuit for providing power thereto. The vehicle security system may include a remote transmitter to be carried by a user and a controller positioned in the vehicle and connected to the light indicator circuit. Further, the controller may be switchable to at least one of an armed mode and a disarmed mode based upon the remote transmitter. Also, the controller may cause the light indicator circuit to selectively supply power to the at least one vehicle light bulb upon switching to at least one of the armed and disarmed modes. The method may include coupling a strobe light device to the light indicator circuit, and providing a confirmation indication to the user that the controller has been switched to at least one of the armed and disarmed modes using the strobe light device. The confirmation indication may be based upon at least one of a leading edge and a trailing edge of the power supplied by the light indicator circuit to the at least one vehicle light bulb. Also, the confirmation indication may have a duration less than a duration of the selectively supplied power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Yet another method aspect of the invention if for operating a vehicle security system for a vehicle comprising at least one vehicle light bulb connector. The vehicle security system may include a remote transmitter to be carried by a user and a controller positioned in the vehicle. The controller may be switchable to at least one of an armed mode and a disarmed mode based upon the remote transmitter. Further, the controller may selectively supply power to the at least one vehicle light bulb connector based upon switching to at least one of the armed and disarmed modes. The method may include coupling a strobe light device to the at least one vehicle light bulb connector, and providing a confirmation indication to the user that the controller has been switched to at least one of the armed and disarmed modes using the strobe light device.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The present invention will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which preferred embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout, and prime notation is used to indicate similar elements in alternative embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> security system for a vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to the invention includes at least one vehicle sensor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a remote transmitter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to be carried by a user, and a controller <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> positioned in the vehicle. The controller <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may be positioned within the dash board of the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, for example, and is connected to a light indicator circuit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, as illustratively shown. The light indicator circuit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> may be a relay, for example, although other suitable devices known to those skilled in the art may also be used. The light indicator circuit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> supplies power from the vehicle&apos;s battery to various vehicle light bulbs, such as headlight bulbs, parking light bulbs, dome light bulbs, etc. The light indicator circuit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> may be connected to the light bulbs of the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by a wiring system <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The controller <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is preferably switchable to at least one of an armed mode and a disarmed mode based upon the remote transmitter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In the armed mode, the controller <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> generates an alarm indication responsive to the vehicle sensor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. For example, the security system may include a siren (not shown), and the controller <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may cause the siren to generate the alarm indication, though other alarm devices may also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> More particularly, the remote transmitter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may include a first button <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> that may be pressed to cause the controller <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to switch to the armed mode, and a second button <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to cause the controller to switch to the unarmed mode. Furthermore, the remote transmitter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may also include a third button <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, which may be a &ldquo;panic&rdquo; button, for example, that causes the controller <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to immediately generate the alarm indication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the controller <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may cause the light indicator circuit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to supply power to one or more of the light bulbs of the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> upon switching to at least one of the armed and disarmed modes. For example, this allows the parking light bulbs of the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to be flashed as a confirmation indication that the controller <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> has received a signal from the remote transmitter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and/or performed a certain function, as discussed above. Yet, if only the parking light bulbs of the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are flashed as a confirmation indication, the confirmation indication may not be very bright, as illustratively shown by the short luminosity lines <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. As a result, it may be difficult for the user to see such a confirmation indication if he is not close to the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, the security system may also include one or more strobe light devices <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> at the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Each strobe light device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> provides a confirmation indication to the user that the controller <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> has been switched to at least one of the armed and disarmed modes. However, the strobe light device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the present invention provides a strobe light confirmation indication that is significantly brighter than that of conventional parking light bulbs, for example, as illustratively shown by the long luminosity lines <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Referring more particularly to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes one or more vehicle light bulb connectors <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, such as the vehicle&apos;s parking light bulb connectors, for example. The vehicle light bulb connector <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> may be within a plastic vehicle light housing <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, for example, and connected to the wiring system <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> via conductors <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. The controller <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may cause the light indicator circuit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to selectively supply power to the vehicle light bulb connector <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> based upon being switched to at least one of the armed and disarmed modes, as described above. The strobe light device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is preferably electrically connected to the vehicle light bulb connector <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> by a strobe connector <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. For example, the vehicle light bulb connector <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> may be a socket, and the strobe connector <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may be a plug for mating with the socket, as illustratively shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> As a result, the strobe light device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> according to the present invention may be used to retrofit existing vehicle security systems without having to run additional wiring or modify existing vehicle light bulb connectors. The strobe connector <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the strobe light device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be manufactured to connect with numerous vehicle parking light bulb sockets as well as other types of vehicle light sockets. As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, for example, the strobe connector <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may include bayonet type connectors <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> for mating with the vehicle light bulb socket <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Of course, the strobe connector <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may include threads or other suitable attachments and may be made in different sizes, as will be appreciated by those of skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The strobe light device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> further includes a strobe light bulb <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> carried by the strobe connector <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and a control circuit <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. More particularly, the strobe light device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may include a strobe light connector <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> which carries the strobe light bulb <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Again, bayonet type connectors, threads, or other suitable attachments may be used to connect the strobe light bulb <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to the strobe light connector <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, as similarly described above. The control circuit <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> receives power via the strobe connector <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and causes the strobe light bulb <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to provide the confirmation indication. For example, the control circuit <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> may include a capacitor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> for storing and discharging power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the control circuit <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> may cause the strobe light bulb <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to provide the confirmation indication, illustrated as pulses <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> based upon a leading edge <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and/or a trailing edge <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, respectively, of the power <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> supplied by the light indicator circuit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, for example. As a result, the strobe light bulb <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> need not be operational when a vehicle light bulb <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is otherwise on. Thus, the duration of the confirmation indication may be less than a duration that the power <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is selectively supplied by the light indicator circuit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. That is, if the vehicle light bulb <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is used as a parking light bulb, for example, the strobe light bulb <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may be set to only flash when the parking lights are turned on or off (i.e., on the leading or trailing edge <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> of the power <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> supplied thereto, respectively), not the entire time that they are on. Accordingly, the strobe light device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the present invention may advantageously provide a strobe light confirmation that does not continually flash the entire duration the vehicle light bulb <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is being used for other vehicle light applications (e.g., park lights). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the control circuit <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> may cause the strobe light bulb <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to provide the confirmation indication for a predetermined duration. Additionally, the control circuit <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> may cause the strobe light bulb <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to flash one or more times. Of course, if more than one flash is desired it may be necessary to adjust the duration during which the controller <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> causes the light indicator circuit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to supply power to the vehicle light bulb connector <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> to allow additional charging time, as will be appreciated by those of skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The strobe light device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may also advantageously include a light bulb connector <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for carrying the vehicle light bulb <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The light bulb connector <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is preferably of the same type as the vehicle light bulb connector <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. In this way, the same bulb recommended by the manufacturer of the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for the vehicle light bulb connector <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> may be used in the light bulb connector <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Even so, the light bulb connector <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be of a different type than the vehicle light bulb connector <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> so that light bulbs other than the recommended vehicle light bulb may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> It is also preferable that the strobe light bulb <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> have a greater luminosity than the vehicle light bulb <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The confirmation indication provided by the strobe light bulb <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> will therefore be much brighter than that provided by just the vehicle light bulb <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Yet, since the strobe light device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may also include the vehicle light bulb <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, the vehicle light bulb is still available for normal vehicle applications (e.g., parking lights). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The vehicle security system of the present invention may also be used with a vehicle including power door locks. The power door locks may include one or more actuators (not shown) for locking and unlocking the doors, and the controller <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may selectively operate the power door locks based upon the remote transmitter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. By way of example, the first button <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the remote transmitter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be used to lock the doors, the second button <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> may be used to unlock the doors, and the third button <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be used to cause a trunk actuator (not shown) to open the trunk of the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In such case, the strobe light device <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> may be used to provide the confirmation indication to the user, indicating that the controller <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> has selectively operated the power door locks, as similarly described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Of course, those of skill in the art will appreciate that the vehicle security system may be used to provide either the alarm function or the door locking/unlocking function, or both. For example, the first button <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the remote transmitter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may cause the controller <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to both lock the doors of the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and to switch to the armed mode, and the second button <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> may similarly cause the controller to both unlock the doors and switch to the disarmed mode.
