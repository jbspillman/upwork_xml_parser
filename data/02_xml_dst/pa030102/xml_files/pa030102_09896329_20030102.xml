<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A vacuum dry sprinkler system includes a sprinkler head formed with a body having a central orifice through which fire extinguishing fluid is expelled through an outlet end. A yoke, attached to the exterior surface of the sprinkler body, extends beyond the outlet end of the sprinkler body and is connected at its apex to a deflector. A thermally sensitive trigger member is coupled to the yoke and the outlet end of the sprinkler head. The sprinkler body carries an expulsion assembly which includes an expulsion member and a thrust member. In response to a fire, the expulsion member of the expulsion assembly overcomes the vacuum force and expels the sealing assembly out of the outlet end of the sprinkler body, while the thrust member laterally thrusts the sealing member out of the water trajectory path, and thus, prevents the sealing assembly from reseating on the outlet of the sprinkler head. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates generally to sprinkler heads used in sprinkler systems for extinguishing and/or controlling a fire, and in particular, to a sprinkler head for use in vacuum dry sprinkler systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Dry fire sprinkler systems are known in the industry, and utilized in applications wherein it is disadvantageous to have water or other fire extinguishing fluid residing within the fluid supply lines of the fire extinguishing system when the sprinkler system is not activated. One specific application in which dry sprinkler systems are used include warehouses and other commercial environments wherein the temperature is low enough to cause freezing of the fluid within the pipes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A common design for a dry sprinkler system is a vacuum dry sprinkler system. In a vacuum dry sprinkler system, the fluid supply pipes operationally connected to the network of sprinklers are continuously exposed to a vacuum which imparts a negative pressure, normally below atmospheric pressure, upon the sprinkler heads of the network. In response to a fire, the individual sprinkler heads within the network are activated by the rupture of a thermally sensitive trigger member carried by each sprinkler head, which in turn subjects the supply lines to a positive pressure, at or above atmospheric pressure. The positive pressure experienced by the system activates a control assembly which subsequently releases water or other fire extinguishing fluid under pressure through the supply lines. This fluid is subsequently expelled from the sprinkler heads in order to suppress or extinguish a fire. An example of a vacuum dry fire sprinkler system is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,927,406, issued to Kadoche on Jul. 27, 1999. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> One problem faced by the sprinkler industry when employing vacuum dry sprinkler systems is overcoming the vacuum pressure once the trigger member is activated. In the sprinkler heads of the sprinkler network, the central orifice of each sprinkler head is sealingly enclosed by a sealing assembly. The sealing assembly is spaced from a deflector, and is maintained in a sealed position by the trigger member normally positioned between the deflector and the sealing assembly. As the central orifice of the sprinkler body is in fluid communication with the supply lines, the sealing assembly is subjected to a vacuum under normal, non-activated conditions. Consequently, when the trigger member is activated by exposure to a preselected temperature, the sealing assembly is released from sealing force imparted by the trigger member. However, given the negative pressure within the central orifice, it has been observed that in many occasions, the vacuum pressure will prevent the removal of the sealing assembly from the orifice outlet. When the sealing assembly remains in the orifice outlet, the vacuum pressure is maintained within the supply lines, and thereby prevents actuation of the vacuum dry sprinkler system in response to a fire. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Another problem experienced by the industry when employing vacuum dry sprinkler systems occurs subsequent to the expulsion of the sealing assembly from the orifice outlet. Once expelled from the outlet, the sealing assembly often contacts and subsequently bounces off the deflector or supporting arms of the sprinkler head and is deflected back towards the orifice outlet. As there still exists a vacuum or negative pressure within the central orifice immediately subsequent to the expulsion of the sealing assembly, when the sealing assembly is deflected back towards the orifice, the sealing assembly is drawn back into the orifice outlet, thereby resealing the orifice outlet, and preventing the vacuum pressure from being broken. This resealing prohibits the activation of the vacuum dry sprinkler system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The resealing problem has prompted the industry to advance various assemblies intended to prevent resealing, however, such solutions have proven ineffective, or, given their complexity, have greatly increased the cost of manufacturing and installation, and reduced the reliability of the vacuum dry sprinkler system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Consequently, there exists a need for a vacuum dry sprinkler system having a sprinkler head capable of effectively expelling the sealing assembly from the sprinkler head outlet in response to a fire, and preventing the resealing of the sealing assembly due to deflection off the frame or deflector of the sprinkler head. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to a vacuum dry sprinkler system utilizing a sprinkler head configured to overcome the vacuum force imparted on the sealing assembly when the thermally responsive trigger is actuated in response to a fire, and further, thrusts the sealing assembly vigorously away from the sprinkler head to thereby prevent resealing caused by the bouncing off or deflection of the sealing assembly off of the frame or deflector of the sprinkler body, and towards the orifice outlet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> According to one aspect of the invention, a vacuum dry sprinkler system includes a fire extinguishing fluid supply line and a control system operably connected to the fire extinguishing fluid supply line which maintains the supply line at a vacuum or negative pressure during a non-activated condition, and is configured to forward fire extinguishing fluid upon exposure to a pressure equal or greater than atmospheric pressure. The system also includes a vacuum dry sprinkler head in fluid communication with the fire extinguishing fluid supply line and includes a sprinkler body with a central orifice and coupled to the fire extinguishing fluid supply line, a pair of frame arms extending a preselected distance from the outlet, a sealing assembly positioned within the orifice outlet, a deflector carried by the frame arms and spaced from the outlet, and a thermally sensitive trigger positioned between the sealing assembly and the deflector which is configured to releasably urge the sealing member into sealing engagement with the central outlet. The sprinkler head also includes a thrust member carried by the frame arms and configured to thrust the sealing assembly away from the sprinkler head to thereby prevent the same from reseating on the orifice outlet when the thermally sensitive trigger is actuated. The thrust member prevents the sealing assembly from contacting the deflector or frame arms of the sprinkler body and subsequently being deflected back into the orifice outlet, and hence, resealing the sprinkler head due to the vacuum pressure of the sprinkler system. By forcing the sealing member away from the sprinkler body, the resealing problem is largely overcome, and results in a more effective and reliable vacuum dry sprinkler system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the invention, the vacuum dry sprinkler system sprinkler head includes a spring expulsion assembly carried by the sprinkler body and having at least one spring force sufficient to sequentially overcome the vacuum pressure imparted upon the sealing assembly when the thermally sensitive trigger is actuated in response to a fire to thereby urge the sealing member from the outlet, and prohibit the sealing assembly from resealing the outlet. This spring expulsion assembly maximizes the responsiveness of the vacuum dry sprinkler system by reducing the probability of failure due to the inability to reliably and immediately separate the sealing assembly from the sprinkler body in response to a fire, and prevent subsequent deflection of the sealing assembly back into the orifice outlet. Consequently, the reliability of the vacuum dry sprinkler system is maximized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> According to still another aspect of the invention, the vacuum dry sprinkler system sprinkler head carries an annular expulsion member operably connected to the sealing assembly. The annular expulsion member overcomes the vacuum pressure exerted upon the sealing assembly and forces the sealing assembly from the outlet and away from the sprinkler body to thereby permit atmospheric pressure to enter the fluid supply line and subsequently activate the vacuum dry sprinkler system. The annular expulsion member thus assures that the sealing assembly does not remain within the central orifice after the thermally sensitive trigger has ruptured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> These and other objects, advantages, and features of this invention will become apparent upon review of the following specification in conjunction with the drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The present invention is embodied in a vacuum dry sprinkler system having at least one sprinkler head configured to vigorously expel the sealing assembly from the sprinkler body in response to a fire, and thus overcome the vacuum or negative pressure upon the sealing assembly to thereby activate the vacuum dry sprinkler system. Furthermore, the sprinkler head contains a thrust member which thrusts the sealing assembly in a direction away from the water trajectory path and thereby prevents reseating of the sealing assembly upon the sprinkler head subsequent to activation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, there is shown a vacuum dry sprinkler system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> positioned within an enclosure <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. Vacuum dry sprinkler system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> generally includes one or more fluid supply lines <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> positioned within an enclosure <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, a preselected distance above floor <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> and below ceiling <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>. Placed at regular intervals along supply lines <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> are sprinkler heads <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, sprinkler heads <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are depicted as projecting <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> upward toward ceiling <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> of enclosure <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, and thus are upright sprinkler heads. However, it will be recognized by those with ordinary skill in the art that sprinkler heads <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be secured to the underside of supply lines <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and depend therefrom towards floor <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, and in such an embodiment be described as pendent sprinkler heads. Sprinkler heads <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are secured to supply lines <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and are in fluid communication therewith. Supply lines <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> are in fluid communication with one another by one or more cross supply lines <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> running generally orthogonal to supply lines <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Supply lines <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> are in fluid communication with a system line <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> which is operably connected to a control system <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. Control system <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is in turn connected to a pump <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> and a pressurized water source <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. Under non-activated conditions, control system <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> activates pump <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> to draw a vacuum through the system line <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> and into supply lines <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and cross supply lines <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. In the non-activated state, pump <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> exerts a negative pressure or vacuum upon supply lines <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and sprinkler heads <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. When the temperature within enclosure <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is elevated to a preselected value indicative of a fire, sprinkler heads <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are actuated, which in turn exposes supply lines <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> to atmospheric or a positive pressure above that experienced during the non-activated condition. This positive pressure is experienced by control system <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> which in turn activates pressurized water source <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, resulting in the forwarding of water throughout supply lines <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and cross supply lines <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. This water subsequently expelled from sprinkler heads <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in an attempt to control or extinguish a fire. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Vacuum dry sprinkler system sprinkler head <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a sprinkler frame or body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and a fluid deflector <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> positioned a preselected distance from top region <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of sprinkler body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by a frame or yoke <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. A thermally sensitive trigger <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is mounted between sprinkler body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and deflector <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Sprinkler body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes an externally threaded bottom region <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, allowing sprinkler body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to be rotatably attached to supply line <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. A central orifice <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is formed in sprinkler body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and provides a fluid flow passageway enabling the expulsion of fire extinguishing fluid from outlet <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> of central orifice <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in response to a fire. Outlet <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is formed with a counterbore <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> which defines an annular shoulder <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Yoke <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is defined by a pair of frame arms <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> projecting from exterior surface <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of sprinkler body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and a preselected distance beyond top region <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Frame arms <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> each have an angled section <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> which meet at an apex <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. Apex <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of yoke <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is formed with a central member or boss <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> having formed therethrough an internally threaded of bore <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. Bore <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> is dimensioned to threadably receive a compression screw or member <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Thermally sensitive trigger <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is preferably in the form of a glass or composite frangible bulb <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Bulb <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is formed to include having an interior filled with a material having a known thermal expansion profile. When the material contained within bulb <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is exposed to a preselected temperature indicative of a fire, its expansion will cause the rupture of the glass in which it is encased. Preferably, bulb <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is formed with a linear center section <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and a pair of circular ends <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Also, preferably, a thin stem <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> depends from end <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In the non-activated state, outlet <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> of sprinkler head <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is sealed by a sealing assembly <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. Sealing assembly <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> includes a hollow plug <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and an insert member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. Plug <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> includes a section <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> which, in the assembled position, projects a preselected distance into central orifice <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Section <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of plug <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> contains an annular ledge <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> which supports insert member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. Extending upwardly beyond top region <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of sprinkler body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and between arms <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of yoke <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, is an external section <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>. Insert member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, positioned within plug <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, includes a generally circular base <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> having formed therethrough a central aperture <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight>, and an annular flange <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> projecting from base <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and towards bottom region <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of sprinkler body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Sprinkler body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> carries an expulsion assembly <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> defined by an expulsion member <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and a thrust member <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. Expulsion assembly <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> is configured to sequentially overcome the vacuum pressure imparted upon sealing assembly <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> once thermally sensitive trigger <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is ruptured in response to a fire. Thereafter, one sealing assembly <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> is separated from outlet <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, expulsion assembly <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> is configured to force sealing assembly <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> in a direction away from sprinkler body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and thus prevent relodgement or resealing of sealing assembly <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> upon outlet <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Expulsion member <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is preferably a Belleville spring, and has a generally circular shape formed with a central aperture <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. In the assembled position, periphery <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> of expulsion member <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> rests upon annular shoulder <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> of outlet <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. Central aperture <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> of expulsion member <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is dimensioned to enable the passage of section <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of plug <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> therethrough, while abuttingly contacting annular ledge <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. Consequently, it will be understood that expulsion member <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> provides a surface upon which plug <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of sealing assembly <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> is seated when sprinkler head <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is in the assembled position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Expulsion member <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is formed having an internally biased spring force which, in the assembled condition, is biased in a direction toward deflector <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, along its center axis. When sealing assembly <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> is positioned within central orifice <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and compression screw <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is rotated to exert a compressive force upon thermal sensitive trigger <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the compressive force is translated to sealing assembly <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and subsequently upon expulsion member <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, which in turn places expulsion member <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> in compression. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In the most preferred embodiment, central aperture <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> has a diameter of approximately 0.439, 0.529, or 0.624 inches while expulsion member <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> exhibits a spring force of approximately ninety five, one hundred ten, or one hundred sixty lbs, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Thrust member <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is positioned about external surface <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of external section <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> of plug <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and is placed in tension about frame arms <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of yoke <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>.

Central arcuate section <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> is connected to generally linear sections <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, each of which is attached to an attachment section <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight>. Each attachment section <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> includes a first member <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> attached to linear sections <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, and a second member <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> extending therefrom. In the preferred embodiment, second member <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> of each attachment section <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> projects from first member <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> at a preselected angle &bgr;, and is tangential with respect to linear sections <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In the most preferred embodiment, angle &agr; of arcuate section <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> is approximately 103&deg; and has a radius of approximately 0.183 inches. Also, in the most preferred embodiment, each linear section <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> has a length <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of approximately 0.402 inches and forms an angle &Dgr; with first member <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> of attachment section <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> of approximately 133.2&deg;. Further, in the most preferred embodiment, each first member <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> of attachment section <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> has a length <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> of approximately 0.058 inches, and forms an angle &phgr; with second member <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> of approximately 60.0&deg;. Also, in the most preferred embodiment, second members <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> have a length <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> of approximately 0.041 inches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Spring <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> may be formed of any material capable of being placed in tension such that when a force is applied to attachment members <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> in a direction towards center line <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, spring <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is placed tension. That is, when attachment members <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> are moved in the direction of center line <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, the angle &agr; expressed by arcuate section <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> is decreased to an angle less than the angle expressed by arcuate section <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> prior to the exertion of force upon attachment sections <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> To assemble sprinkler head <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, expulsion member <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is placed in supporting contact with annular shoulder <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> of outlet <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. Care must be taken at this stage of assembly to assure that expulsion member <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is correctly positioned such that when expulsion member <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is released from compression, its spring force will urge seating assembly <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> in a direction towards deflector <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and out of outlet <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> of central orifice <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Once expulsion member <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is in position, plug <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, having insert member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> positioned on annular ledge <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, is placed through central aperture <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> of expulsion member <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, bulb <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is placed within plug <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> with end <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> abuttingly contacting, and resting upon, the periphery defined by aperture <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> of base <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. When so positioned, stem <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> will depend through aperture <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> of insert member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and be positioned within section <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of plug <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, bulb <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is moved into a generally vertical position with end <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> positioned a preselected distance below bottom surface <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>&prime; of boss <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Once bulb <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is in position, compression screw <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is threadably rotated within internally threaded aperture <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> and eventually contacts end <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of bulb <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Continued rotation of compression screw <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> exerts a compression force upon bulb <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> in a direction towards bottom region <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. As plug <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> moves toward bottom region <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, expulsion member <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is likewise forced in a downward direction towards bottom region <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and is placed in compression. Upon release of the force exerted upon sealing assembly <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> when bulb <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> ruptures in response to a fire, expulsion member <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> will exert a rigorous and immediate force in the upward direction towards deflector <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to thereby expel seating assembly <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> from outlet <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> of central orifice <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Once sufficient compression of bulb <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is achieved, thrust member <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is attached to sprinkler body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Specifically, attachment sections <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> are received within notches <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> formed in arms <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, while arcuate section <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> will be placed about a section of the external surface <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> of external section <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> of plug member <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. When in position, thrust member <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is in tension, and exerts a lateral force upon plug <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. However, plug <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of sealing assembly <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> is maintained in sealing contact with outlet <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> of central orifice <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> by the compressive force exerted by bulb <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Once sprinkler head <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is in the assembled condition, externally threaded bottom region <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may be rotatably secured to a supply line <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> of the vacuum dry sprinkler system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In operation, once attached to a vacuum dry sprinkler system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, central orifice <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> will experience a negative or vacuum pressure. In response to a fire, the fluid within frangible bulb <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> will expand and eventually cause its rupture. At this point, sealing assembly <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> will continue to experience a sealing force as a result of the vacuum imparted upon central orifice <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> by vacuum dry sprinkler system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, despite that the force upon sealing assembly <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, exerted by bulb <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, has been eliminated. However, once fusible bulb <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> ruptures, the compressive force exerted upon expulsion member <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is immediately released, and as a result of its internal spring force, overcomes the vacuum pressure and forcibly and immediately expels seating assembly <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> from outlet <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> of central orifice <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and thus breaks the vacuum seal upon central orifice <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> As the rupture of bulb <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, and the subsequent expulsion of sealing assembly <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> by expulsion member <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, occurs within a very small time frame, the vacuum force or negative pressure imparted upon central orifice <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> by vacuum dry sprinkler system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> has a tendency to cause the relodgement of seating assembly <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> within outlet <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and thereby prohibits positive pressure from entering central orifice <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and subsequently activating vacuum dry sprinkler system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. However, thrust member <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> assures that seating assembly <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, will be thrust in a lateral direction away from sprinkler body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and thus assures that sufficient pressure will be introduced within central orifice <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, causing the subsequent activation of vacuum dry sprinkler system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Specifically, thrust member <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, once frangible bulb <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> ruptures, exerts a force upon external section <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> of plug member <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> in a lateral direction substantially orthogonal to the water trajectory path or center axis <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>&prime; of central orifice <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Once vacuum dry sprinkler system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is activated, water or other fire extinguishing fluid will travel supply line <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, into central orifice <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of sprinkler head <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and be forcibly expelled therefrom via outlet <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. The water will then impact deflector <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, resulting in dispersal of the water in an optimum pattern in order to attempt to control, suppress, or extinguish a fire. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Thus, it can be seen that the combination of the expulsion member <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and thrust member <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> provides an effective synergistic, combinatorial action upon seating assembly <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, which in turn, when used in conjunction with a vacuum dry sprinkler system, effectively expels seating assembly <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> from the outlet <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, and thrusts the same in a lateral direction to thereby prevent its resealing upon outlet <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and subsequently preventing the activation of the vacuum dry sprinkler system. The presence of expulsion assembly <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> significantly increases the reliability and effectiveness of a vacuum dry sprinkler system by assuring that the adequate positive pressure will be experienced by control system <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> so as to result in the expedient activation of vacuum dry sprinkler system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in an attempt to control a fire. </paragraph>
