<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates in general to the field of television systems, and more particularly, to the field of interactive television. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> With the recent advent of digital transmission technology, subscriber network television systems are now capable of providing many other services in addition to traditional analog broadcast video. For example, two-way and advanced one-way communications between a subscriber and a subscriber network system headend are now possible. The home communication terminal (&ldquo;HCT&rdquo;), also known as the set-top box, has become an important computing device for accessing video services and navigating a subscriber through a maze of services available. In addition to supporting traditional analog broadcast video and functionality, digital HCTs (or &ldquo;DHCTs&rdquo;) now also support an increasing number of enhanced video services that are made available through digital transmission technology. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Interactive television is an enhanced video technology enabled by two-way communication between a subscriber and a subscriber network system headend that is made possible by digital transmission technology and consists of such enhanced services as video-on-demand (&ldquo;VOD&rdquo;). In the digital transmission infrastructure that is utilized for interactive television, VOD service requires the exclusive or substantially exclusive use of bandwidth capacity, and thus, a portion of the infrastructure serves as the VOD infrastructure. Multiple System Operators (&ldquo;MSOs&rdquo;) invests millions of dollars in the construction and maintenance of VOD infrastructures to insure that there is sufficient bandwidth capacity available for VOD service. Thus, there is a need to efficiently utilize the VOD infrastructure to generate revenue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> There are other electronic communications systems that have been used for the sale and delivery of audio, video, and other products that can be transmitted electronically. For example, one may be able to purchase an audio product on the Internet and then download it to a personal computer for future use. The application of electronic communications systems for the sale and delivery of applicable products can offer advantages over more conventional product sales and delivery systems such as phone ordering with parcel delivery. For example, advantages may be offered such as the lower cost of product delivery or the savings of not requiring inventory, floor space, and retail employees. But, the present electronic communications sales and delivery systems are subject to problems with piracy of source content resulting in lost sales and revenues, and are generally incapable of consistent fast delivery. Furthermore, these systems are designed with provisions for delivering media products at master quality. Thus, there is a need for secure and fast sale and delivery of master quality audio, video, software, and other products by way of an electronic communications system. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The preferred embodiment of the present invention can be viewed, among other things, as a media system which includes logic configured to provide a user interface that provides a user with a plurality of media content selections available at various times, and a portable client media drive configured to receive over a secured transmission medium the media content selected by the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The preferred embodiment of the present invention also provides a method for recording media content. This method can be broadly summarized as follows: providing a user interface to select from a plurality of media content selections available at different times; receiving from a remote device the selected media content over a secured transmission medium; and recording the selected media content onto at least one portable medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Other systems, methods, features, and advantages of the preferred embodiments of the invention will be or become apparent to one with ordinary skill in the art upon examination of the following drawings and detailed description. It is intended that all such additional systems, methods, features, and advantages be included within this description, be within the scope of the present invention, and be protected by the accompanying claims.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The preferred embodiments of the invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which preferred embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those having ordinary skill in the art. Furthermore, all &ldquo;examples&rdquo; given herein are intended to be non-limiting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> One preferred embodiment of the present invention is generally implemented as part of a subscriber network television system, such as for a non-limiting example, a digital broadband delivery system (DBDS) or a cable television system (CTS). Hence, an illustrative DBDS and its operation will be described initially. Other conventional data delivery systems are also included within the scope of the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a block diagram view of a DBDS <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, which is generally a high quality, reliable and integrated network system that is preferably capable of delivering video, audio, voice and data services to client devices, such as a digital home communication terminal devices (DHCTs) <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Although <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> depicts a high level view of a DBDS <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, it should be appreciated that a plurality of DBDS systems can tie together a plurality of regional networks into an integrated global network so that DHCT users can receive media content provided from anywhere in the world. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The DBDS <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> preferably delivers broadcast video signals as digitally formatted signals in addition to delivering traditional broadcast analog video signals. Furthermore, the system can preferably support one way broadcast services as well as both one-way data services and two-way media and data services. The two-way operation of the network preferably allows for user interactivity with services, such as Pay-Per-View programming, Near Video-On-Demand (NVOD) programming according to any of several known NVOD implementation methods, View-on-Demand (VOD) programming (according to any of several VOD implementation methods), and interactive applications, such as Internet connections. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The DBDS <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also provides the interfaces, network control, transport control, session control, and servers to access media content from media services, and distributes media content to DHCT users. Note that the term media content will be understood to mean the content stored and delivered throughout the DBDS <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, such as movies, software, music, etc. When it is helpful to discuss each individual movie or program, etc. (i.e. media content in the singular), the term media content instance or the like will be used. The title of that media content instance will be referred to as a media content title. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> typical DBDS <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a head end <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, hubs <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, an HFC access network <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, and DHCTs <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. It should be appreciated that although a single component (e.g. a head end) is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> DBDS <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can feature a plurality of any one of the illustrated components or may be configured with alternative embodiments for any one of the individual components or with yet other additional components not enumerated above. Media content provided by one or more content providers, such as content provider <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, is communicated by the content providers to one or more head ends <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. From those head ends <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> the content is then communicated over a communications network <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> that includes a plurality of HFC access networks <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> (only one HFC access network <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is illustrated). The HFC access network <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> preferably comprises a plurality of HFC nodes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, each of which may serve a local geographical area. The hub <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> connects to the HFC node <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> through a fiber portion of the HFC access network <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The HFC node <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is connected to a tap <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which, in one implementation, is connected to a digital home communication terminal (DHCT) <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In other implementations, the tap <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is connected to a network interface unit (NIU) <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> which is connected to a digital home communication terminal (DHCT) <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The NIU <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is normally located at the property of a user and provides a transparent interface between the HFC node <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the users&apos; internal wiring. Coaxial cables are typically used to couple nodes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, taps <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and NIUs <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> because the electrical signals can be easily repeated with radio frequency (RF) amplifiers. As the high-level operations of many of the functions of a DBDS <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are well known to those of skill in the art, further high level description of the overall DBDS <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> will not be contained herein. It will be appreciated, however, that the DBDS <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is merely illustrative and should not be construed as implying any limitations upon the scope of the embodiments of the invention. For instance, subscriber network television systems also included within the scope of the embodiments of the invention include systems not utilizing physical structured cabling for transmission, such as, but not limited to, satellite systems. Further, transmission media included within the scope of the embodiments of the invention include, but are not limited to, HFC, optical, satellite, RF, FM, and microwave. Further, data provided from the head end <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to the DHCTs <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and programming necessary to perform the functions discussed below will be understood to be present in the DBDS <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, in accordance with the description below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows one implementation of transmission channels supported by the DBDS <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, as delivered by the head end <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and received as input channels by the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Although one DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and one head end <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are illustrated, it is understood by those having ordinary skill in the art that more than one of each may be included in a subscriber network television system. As indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the subscriber network television system can simultaneously support a number of transport channel types and modulation formats. The ability to carry analog and digital signals over a large bandwidth are characteristics of a hybrid fiber/coax (HFC) network typically employed in a subscriber network television system. As will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art, analog and digital signals in HFC networks can be multiplexed using, in one implementation, frequency division multiplexing (FDM), which enables many different types of signals to be transmitted over the subscriber network television system to the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In one typical implementation, a subscriber network television system using HFC supports downstream (i.e. in the direction from the head end <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>) frequencies from 50 MHz to 870 MHz, whereas upstream frequencies (i.e. in the direction from the DHCT to higher levels of the system) are in the 5 MHz to 42 MHz band. Generally, the RF channel bandwidth spacing for analog and digital services is 6 MHz. Furthermore, for a typical 870 MHz system in the U.S., a possible downstream RF spectrum subdivision plan uses 6 MHz spaced RF channels within the 50 MHz to 550 MHz band for analog video carriers and within the 550 MHz to 870 MHz range for digital carriers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the downstream direction channels, having been multiplexed preferably using frequency division multiplexing (FDM), and often referred to as in band channels, include Analog Transmission Channels (ATCs) <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and Digital Transmission Channels (DTCs) <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. These channels carry video, audio, and data services. For example, these channels can carry television signals, Internet data, or any additional types of data, such as Electronic Program Guide (EPG) data. The signals and data carried on these channels are provided through software, collectively referred to herein as services, as further defined below. The ATCs <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> are typically broadcast in 6 MHz channels having an analog broadcast composed of analog video and analog audio, and include Broadcast TV Systems Committee (BTSC) stereo and Secondary Audio Program (SAP) audio. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Like the ATCs <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, the DTCs <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> each occupy 6 MHz of the RF spectrum. However, the DTCs <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> are preferably digital channels consisting of 64- or 256-Quadrature Amplitude Modulated (QAM) digital signals formatted as MPEG-2 transport streams, allocated in a separate frequency range. The MPEG-2 transport stream enables transmission of a plurality of DTC channel types over each 6 MHz RF channel, as compared to a 6 MHz ATC <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. Three types of digital transport channels <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> include broadcast digital transmission channels <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, carousel digital transmission channels <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, and on-demand transmission channels <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. MPEG-2 transport may be used to multiplex video, audio, and data in each of these digital transmission channels (DTCs) <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. However, because MPEG-2 transport streams multiplex video, audio, and data to be placed in the same stream, the DTCs <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> do not necessarily have to be allocated in separate 6 MHz RF frequencies, unlike the ATCs <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Continuing with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the broadcast DTCs <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and carousel DTCs <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> preferably function as continuous feeds for indefinite time, whereas the on demand DTCs <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> are continuous feed sessions for a limited time. Preferably, all DTCs <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> are capable of being transmitted at high data rates. The broadcast DTCs <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> preferably carry data comprising multiple digitally compressed and formatted as MPEG-2, TV channels and other continuously fed data information. The carousel DTCs <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> carry broadcast data, such as EPG data and data for a catalog of recordable media content, that is systematically broadcast in a cycling fashion but updated and revised as need be. Thus, the carousel DTCs <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> can serve to carry high volume data, such as EPG data and purchasable recordable media (PRM) catalog data, as well as other data at high data rates. The carousel DTCs <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> preferably carry data formatted in directories and files by a Broadcast File System (BFS), which is used for producing and transmitting data streams throughout the subscriber network television system, and which provides an efficient method for delivery of application executables and application data to the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The on demand DTCs <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> can carry particular information, such as compressed video and audio pertaining to subscriber requested video services or recordable media content, as well as other specialized data information. Each carousel DTC <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and on demand DTC <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is defined by a session managed by a session manager <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, via an MPEG-2 Digital Storage Media&mdash;Command and Control (DSM-CC) protocol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Also shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is an Out-Of-Band (OOB) channel <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> that provides a continuously available two-way signaling path to the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> regardless of which in-band channels are tuned to by an individual DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in-band tuner. The DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may also comprise multiple in-band tuners in which case the OOB channel <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> complements the service of the set of in-band tuners. The OOB channel <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> consists of a forward data channel (FDC) and a reverse data channel (RDC). The OOB channel <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> can comply to any one of a number of well known transport protocols but preferably complies to either a DAVIC 1.1 Transport Protocol with FDC of 1.544 MBps or more using Quadrature Phase-Shift Keying (QPSK) modulation and an RDC of 1.544 Mbps or more using QPSK modulation, or to a DOCSIS Transport Protocol with FDC of 27 Mbps using 64-QAM modulation and a RDC of 1.544 Mbps or more using QPSK modulation or 16-QAM modulation. The OOB channel <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> provides the two-way operation of the network, which allows a subscriber interactivity with the services provided by the network. Therefore, the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> preferably contains functionality similar to a networked computer (i.e., a computer without a persistent storage device) in addition to traditional set top box functionality, as is well known in the art. Furthermore, the OOB channel <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> is not limited to a 6 MHz spectrum, but generally to a smaller spectrum, such as 1.5 or 3 MHz, in one embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a block diagram of the example headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, as configured in a subscriber network television system, to provide purchasable and recordable media (PRM) content services, either as an on-demand or scheduled service with a plurality of possible delivery durations. It will be understood that the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is merely illustrative and should not be construed as implying any limitations upon the scope of the preferred embodiments of the invention. In the system headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a PRM application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> and a plurality of other application servers (not shown) are connected to a digital network control system (DNCS) <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> via an Ethernet connection <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>. The PRM application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> preferably is responsible for the following: reserving and configuring system resources needed to provide PRM services, for packaging, configuring and making available the executable software program comprising a PRM application client <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>), for providing configuration and service data (such as a catalog of recordable media content categorized and displayed by titles available for rent and/or purchase) to PRM application clients <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>), and for storing data at the request of a PRM application client <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight>. A PRM application client <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> executing on processor <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) in DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> generates a user interface that is displayed on television <highlight><bold>441</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) for the subscriber to browse, purchase, and access media content such as movies, CDs, video clips, etc. This may require, among other things, engaging, preferably, in a direct two-way IP (Internet Protocol) connection with VOD content servers <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> provides management, monitoring, and control of the DBDS <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) network elements and broadcast services provided to users. The DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> provides control and communication functionality by monitoring the DHCTs <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and facilitating messaging between the DHCTs <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and components within the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. When any of the communication functionality is provided by headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> components other than the DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight>, the DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> indirectly provides similar functionality by providing the control and coordination to those other devices that provide the required communication functionality to enact a particular media service. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In one implementation, the DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> includes functional support for client-server applications and other components in the DBDS <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) with its server counterparts, including BFS Server <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> and SAM server <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight>, which will be described in greater detail below. Briefly, the client-server application counterparts work in coordination with DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> to effectively utilize the primary features of the interactive television system and manage the sale and delivery of audio, video, software, and other media content. Furthermore, the client-server application software in communication with DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> can effectively redirect allocation of excess VOD infrastructure capacity to facilitate maximum rate delivery of (PRM) content and also manages impulse purchase and trial purchase transactions, in cooperation with the PRM application client <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). Also, in one implementation, the DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> uses a data insertion multiplexor <highlight><bold>329</bold></highlight> and a data QAM <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> to insert the in-band broadcast file system (BFS) data into a compressed data stream, for example, an MPEG-2 transport stream. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> includes a session manager <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> and a conditional access system <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight>. The session manager <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> preferably uses the MPEG-2 DSM-CC protocol to coordinate requests for media content, for example, PRM content. The session manager <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> processes user to network (U-N) session signaling messages, manages allocation of session-related network resources and supports network management operations. The session manager <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> supports exclusive services, such as the PRM service, by providing the signaling interface to establish, maintain, and release client initiated exclusive sessions. The session manager <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> acts as a point of contact to the network for the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in the network <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to establish individual sessions. The session manager <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> also defines a resource descriptor structure, which is used to request the network resources within a session. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The conditional access system <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> communicates with the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the billing system <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> to determine whether a particular subscriber is authorized to receive PRM content. If a DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is not authorized for PRM service, the conditional access system <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> insures that such services are not transmitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The PRM application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> communicates via the Ethernet connection <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> to a service application manager (SAM) server <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> contained on the DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight>. Service application manager (SAM) server <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> is a server component of a client-server pair of components, with the client component being located at the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Together, the client-server SAM components provide a system in which the user can access services, which are identified by an application to run and one or more parameters, such as particular data content, specific to that service. The SAM server <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> also manages the life cycle of the applications on the system, including the definition, activation, and suspension of services they provide and the downloading of the applications into the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> as necessary. The PRM application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> defines its application to the SAM server <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> and the SAM server <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> instructs the BFS server <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> to add the executable code for the PRM application client <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) to a carousel (not shown) for distribution to the various DHCTs <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in the network <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. In other embodiments, executable code is not transferred, but instead, functionality is effected through other mechanisms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The BFS server <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> is a part of a broadcast file system that has a BFS client <highlight><bold>443</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) in each DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in the network <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Applications on both the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can access the data stored in the BFS server <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> in a similar manner to a file system found on disc operating systems. The BFS server <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> loads data for applications on a carousel (not shown) that sends data in a cyclical repeated fashion, each cycle approximately the same period of time so that the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> that communicates a request for any particular data may receive it when the user desires the data. Thus, the BFS client <highlight><bold>443</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) contained in the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> that receives the broadcast from the BFS server <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> can implement the application for the user, as will be described in greater detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> PRM content or data can reside in the PRM application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight>, in the VOD content server <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>, or in other application servers (not shown). The content manager <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> and VOD content servers <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> deliver MPEG-2 content to a group of QAM modulators <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>. PRM content can reside in VOD content servers <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> as a movie, as an audio program, or as an MPEG-2 private data program. The content manager <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> is responsible for managing the content on the VOD content servers <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> and on other servers such as PRM application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> or other application servers (not shown). The PRM application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> utilizes the content manager <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> and VOD content servers <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> to deliver the data, video and/or audio streams that make up the PRM services. The PRM application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> is also responsible for controlling the content manager <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> and VOD content servers <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>. The QAM group <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> is actually a multiplex of QAMs that support PRM content transmission to a particular DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The session manager <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> in DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> determines which QAM modulator has access to a particular DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The QAM modulators <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> are also responsible for encrypting the transport stream and inserting other data and information into the stream, as will be described in more detail below. The QAM modulators <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> receive the MPEG-2 transport stream from the VOD content servers <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> and convert it to an encrypted RF signal at a specified frequency (channel). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the invention, content manager <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> fulfills management of VOD content and PRM content. In an alternate embodiment, content manager <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> is comprised of two entities, a first content manager dedicated to VOD content management and a second manager dedicated to PRM content management. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> A Quadrature Phase-Shift Keying (QPSK) modem <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> is responsible for transporting the out-of-band IP (Internet protocol) datagram traffic between the distribution headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and a DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Data from the QPSK modem <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> is routed by headend router <highlight><bold>327</bold></highlight> within the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The headend router <highlight><bold>327</bold></highlight> is also responsible for delivering upstream application traffic, such as a user requests for PRM content, to the various application servers, such as, for example, PRM application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a block diagram illustrating a DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> that is coupled to a headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and to a television <highlight><bold>441</bold></highlight>. It will be understood that the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is merely illustrative and should not be construed as implying any limitations upon the scope of the preferred embodiments of the invention. Some of the functionality performed by applications executed in the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (for example, the PRM client application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight>) may instead be performed at the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and vice versa, in some embodiments. A DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is typically situated at the residence of a user or place of business and may be a stand-alone unit or integrated into another device such as, for example, a television set or a personal computer or an audio device, such as, for example, a programmable radio. The DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> preferably includes a communications interface <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight> for receiving signals (video, audio and/or other data) from the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> through the network <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and for providing any reverse information to the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> through the network <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> preferably includes at least one processor <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight> for controlling operations of the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, an output system <highlight><bold>448</bold></highlight> for driving the television display <highlight><bold>441</bold></highlight>, and at least one tuner system <highlight><bold>445</bold></highlight> for tuning into a particular television channel to be displayed and for sending and receiving various types of data or media content to and from the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The tuner system <highlight><bold>445</bold></highlight> includes, in one implementation, an out-of-band tuner and upstream transmitter for bi-directional QPSK data communication and a quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) tuner (in-band) for receiving television signals. It should be appreciated that the OOB tuner and upstream transmitter can be one component, or in other embodiments, the tuner and transmitter can be independent of each other and located separately within the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The OOB tuner and upstream transmitter enables the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to interface with a subscriber network television system so that the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can provide upstream data to the network, for example, via a QPSK channel that serves as an upstream OOB channel and received by a QPSK receiver in QPSK modem <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> in headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. In this manner, a subscriber can interact with the subscriber network television system to request services or the data of services such as, for example, PRM content. Alternatively, the upstream data transmission can be effected via a QAM channel with a QAM transmitter in DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and a QAM receiver in headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, a telephone modem in the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be utilized for upstream data transmission. Further, a headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> or hub <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or other component located upstream in the subscriber network television system may receive data from a telephone network coupled to a telephone modem and can route the upstream data to a destination internal or external to the subscriber network television system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> preferably includes a demultiplexing system <highlight><bold>443</bold></highlight> comprising functionality for QAM demodulation, forward error correction (FEC), transport demultiplexing, decryption (via decryptor <highlight><bold>588</bold></highlight>), and parsing, as is well known in the art, to counter the effect of signal processing of broadcast media content and data in the subscriber network television system. Transport demultiplexing preferably includes MPEG-2 transport demultiplexing. The demultiplexing system <highlight><bold>443</bold></highlight> in communication with communication interface <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight>, tuner system <highlight><bold>445</bold></highlight> and processor <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight> effects reception of compressed video streams, compressed audio streams, and compressed data streams corresponding to a selected program to be separated from other programs and/or streams transported in the tuned transmission channel and to be eventually stored in secondary storage device <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) in accordance with one embodiment of the invention, as will be described in greater detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Additionally, a receiver <highlight><bold>446</bold></highlight> receives externally generated information, such as user inputs or commands from other devices. The DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may also include one or more wireless or wired interfaces, also called communication ports <highlight><bold>474</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>475</bold></highlight>, for receiving and/or transmitting data to other devices. For example, the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may feature USB (Universal Serial Bus), Ethernet (for connection to a computer), IEEE-1394 (for connection to media devices in an entertainment center), serial, and/or parallel ports. The user inputs may be, for example, provided by a computer or transmitter with buttons or keys located either on the exterior of the terminal or by a hand-held remote control device or keyboard that includes user-actuated buttons, or the user inputs may be aural. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In one implementation, the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> includes system memory <highlight><bold>449</bold></highlight>, which includes FLASH memory <highlight><bold>451</bold></highlight> and dynamic random access memory (DRAM) <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight>, for storing various applications, modules and data for execution and use by the processor <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight>. Basic functionality of the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is provided by an operating system <highlight><bold>453</bold></highlight> that is primarily stored in FLASH memory <highlight><bold>451</bold></highlight>. Among other elements, the operating system <highlight><bold>453</bold></highlight> includes at least one resource manager <highlight><bold>467</bold></highlight> that provides an interface to resources of the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> such as, for example, computing resources. An application referred to as a navigator <highlight><bold>455</bold></highlight> is also resident in FLASH memory <highlight><bold>451</bold></highlight> for providing a navigation framework for services provided by the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The navigator <highlight><bold>455</bold></highlight> registers for and in some cases reserves certain user inputs related to navigational keys such as channel increment/decrement, last channel, favorite channel, etc. The navigator <highlight><bold>455</bold></highlight> also provides users with television related menu options that correspond to DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> functions such as, for example, blocking a channel or a group of channels from being displayed in a channel menu. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The FLASH memory <highlight><bold>451</bold></highlight> also contains a platform library <highlight><bold>456</bold></highlight>. The platform library <highlight><bold>456</bold></highlight> is a collection of utilities useful to applications, such as a timer manager, a compression manager, a configuration manager, an HTML parser, a database manager, a widget toolkit, a string manager, and other utilities (not shown). These utilities are accessed by applications via application programming interfaces (APIs) as necessary so that each application does not have to contain these utilities. Two components of the platform library <highlight><bold>456</bold></highlight> that are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> are a window manager <highlight><bold>459</bold></highlight> and a service application manager client (SAM) <highlight><bold>457</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The window manager <highlight><bold>459</bold></highlight> provides a mechanism for implementing the sharing of the screen regions and user input. The window manager <highlight><bold>459</bold></highlight> in the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is responsible for, as directed by one or more applications, implementing the creation, display, and de-allocation of the limited DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> screen display resources. It allows multiple applications to share the screen by assigning ownership of screen regions, or windows. The window manager <highlight><bold>459</bold></highlight> also maintains, among other things, a user input registry <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> in DRAM <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight>. When a user enters a key or a command via the remote control device <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> or another input device such as a keyboard or mouse, the user input registry <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> is accessed to determine which of various applications running on the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> should receive data corresponding to the input key and in which order. As an application is executed, it registers a request to receive certain user input keys or commands. When the user presses a key corresponding to one of the commands on the remote control device <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight>, the command is received by the receiver <highlight><bold>446</bold></highlight> and relayed to the processor <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight>. The processor <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight> dispatches the event to the operating system <highlight><bold>453</bold></highlight> where it is forwarded to the window manager <highlight><bold>459</bold></highlight> which ultimately accesses the user input registry <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> and routes data corresponding to the incoming command to the appropriate application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The Client SAM <highlight><bold>457</bold></highlight> is a client component of a client-server pair of components, with the server component being located on the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> preferably in DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight>. A SAM database <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight> (i.e. structured data such as a database or data structure) in DRAM <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> includes a data structure of services and a data structure of channels that are created and updated by the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Herein, database will refer to a database, structured data or other data structures as is well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Many services can be defined using the same application component, with different parameters. Examples of services include, without limitation and in accordance with one implementation, presenting television programs (available through a WatchTV application <highlight><bold>462</bold></highlight>), pay-per-view events (available through a PPV application <highlight><bold>464</bold></highlight>), digital music (<highlight><bold>478</bold></highlight>), video-on-demand (available through an VOD application <highlight><bold>463</bold></highlight>), purchasable recordable media (PRM) services (via PRM application client <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight>), and an interactive program guide (available through IPG application <highlight><bold>377</bold></highlight>). In general, the identification of a service includes the identification of an executable application that provides the service along with a set of application-dependent parameters that indicate to the application the service to be provided. For example, a service of presenting a television program could be executed by WatchTV application <highlight><bold>462</bold></highlight> with a set of parameters specifying the HBO to view HBO or with a separate set of parameters to view CNN. Each association of the application component (tune video) and one parameter component (HBO or CNN) represents a particular service that has a unique service I.D. The Client SAM <highlight><bold>457</bold></highlight> also interfaces with the resource manager <highlight><bold>467</bold></highlight>, as discussed below, to control resources of the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The PRM client application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> preferably is downloaded into DRAM <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> from the head end <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the PRM client application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> may be resident in FLASH memory <highlight><bold>451</bold></highlight>. Similar to an EPG application (not shown) that has an EPG database of records in which program information is supported by client-server EPG counterparts, the PRM client application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> employs a first PRM database <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight> of records that comprises information pertaining to PRM content for presentation to a subscriber. The first PRM database <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight> contains sufficient information for the presentation of available PRM content at the current time and for subsequent periods. The PRM application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight>, in communication with PRM application client <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight>, effects updates to the first PRM database <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight> stored in memory <highlight><bold>449</bold></highlight> or in a storage device (such as storage device <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>) of DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. PRM application client <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> reads first PRM database <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight> records and processes them into a displayable representation as part of a GUI presentation displayed on a television <highlight><bold>441</bold></highlight> or similar display device for presentation to a subscriber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> PRM content information associated with PRM content is transmitted on a regular or periodic basis from PRM application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) to one or more DHCTs <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. PRM content information may comprise descriptive information to populate the entries of a PRM guide, a service guide, or an EPG presentation with the corresponding PRM fields that are presented to the subscriber via a Graphical-User-Interface (GUI) from which a subscriber can select and request additional descriptive information about respective PRM content. Hence, per PRM content in the displayed presentation to the subscriber, the subscriber can retrieve and view (and hear if applicable) information specific to a PRM content title and proceed to purchase specific PRM content (i.e. one or more PRM content instances), as will be described in greater detail below. PRM content information comprises data organized into records of the first PRM database <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight> with record fields containing, but not limited to, information such as PRM content title, PRM content description, PRM genre, release year, casts or performers list, ratings information, and play duration for each PRM content instance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Application clients can also be downloaded into DRAM <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> at the request of the Client SAM <highlight><bold>457</bold></highlight>, preferably in response to a request by the user or in response to a message from the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. In one implementation, DRAM <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> contains a video-on-demand application (VOD) <highlight><bold>463</bold></highlight>, an e-mail application <highlight><bold>476</bold></highlight>, a PRM application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight>, and a web browser application <highlight><bold>475</bold></highlight>, among others. It should be clear to one with ordinary skill in the art that these applications are not limiting and merely serve as examples for one embodiment of the invention. Furthermore, one or more DRAM based applications may, as an alternative embodiment, be resident in FLASH memory <highlight><bold>451</bold></highlight>. These applications, and others provided by the subscriber network television system operator, are top level software entities on the network for providing services to the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> In one implementation, applications executing on the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> work with the navigator <highlight><bold>455</bold></highlight> by abiding by several guidelines. First, an application utilizes the Client SAM <highlight><bold>457</bold></highlight> for the provision, activation, and suspension of services. Second, an application shares DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> resources with other applications and abides by the resource management policies of the Client SAM <highlight><bold>457</bold></highlight>, the operating system <highlight><bold>453</bold></highlight>, and the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Third, an application handles situations where resources are only available with navigator <highlight><bold>455</bold></highlight> intervention. Fourth, when an application loses service authorization while providing a service, the application suspends the service via the SAM (the navigator <highlight><bold>455</bold></highlight> will reactivate an individual service application when it later becomes authorized). Finally, an application client is designed to not have access to certain user input keys reserved by the navigator (i.e., power, channel &plus;/&minus;, volume &plus;/&minus;, etc.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> An executable program or algorithm corresponding to an operating system (OS) component, or to a client platform component, or to a client application, or to respective parts thereof, can reside in and execute out of DRAM <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> and/or FLASH memory <highlight><bold>451</bold></highlight>. Likewise, data input into or output from any executable program can reside in DRAM <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> or FLASH memory <highlight><bold>451</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, an executable program or algorithm corresponding to an OS component, or to a client platform component, or to a client application, or to respective parts thereof, can reside in FLASH memory <highlight><bold>451</bold></highlight>, or in a local storage device coupled to DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and can be transferred into DRAM <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> for execution. Likewise, data input for an executable program can reside in FLASH memory <highlight><bold>451</bold></highlight> or a storage device, for example storage device <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>, and can be transferred into DRAM <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> for use by an executable program or algorithm. In addition, data output by an executable program can be written into DRAM <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> by an executable program or algorithm and can be transferred into FLASH memory <highlight><bold>451</bold></highlight> or into a storage device for storage purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The security processor <highlight><bold>565</bold></highlight> is a secure element for performing security and conditional access related functions. More particularly, the security processor <highlight><bold>565</bold></highlight> functions to authorize the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of a paying subscriber to execute specialized functionality of the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, such as receiving and decrypting (or descrambling) encrypted (or scrambled) media content and other data sent from a remote device. Security processor <highlight><bold>565</bold></highlight> preferably includes a microprocessor and a memory that only the microprocessor of the security processor <highlight><bold>565</bold></highlight> may access. Preferably, security processor <highlight><bold>565</bold></highlight> is contained in a tamper proof package. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, in one implementation, encryption is applied to the data stream of the requested media content, for example the respective PRM content, at the QAM group <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> at the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> according to encryption methods well-known to those of ordinary skill in the art. An encryption component resident in the QAM group <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> in the head end <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and under the direction of the DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> encrypts, for example, MPEG-2 transport stream packets used to transmit the PRM content. The encrypted PRM content also includes, in one embodiment, entitlement control messages that are recognized by the security processor <highlight><bold>565</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) at the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> as information needed to decrypt the encrypted PRM content. Security processor <highlight><bold>565</bold></highlight> preferably stores authorization information, wherein the authorization information indicates that the subscriber is entitled to access the PRM content. The authorization information is obtained from one or more entitlement messages sent by the head end <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> after, or concurrently with, initialization of the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> into a purchased service. If the authorization information indicates that the subscriber is entitled to the PRM content, security processor <highlight><bold>565</bold></highlight> generates a code word or key based on the authorization information and the received entitlement control message, and the security processor <highlight><bold>565</bold></highlight> uses this key to decrypt the encrypted PRM content at the decryptor <highlight><bold>588</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> includes a primary storage device <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> and a secondary storage device <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>. The ability to record programming on the primary storage device <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> provides a convenient method to temporarily buffer programming to fit a viewing schedule, however, in accordance with one embodiment, for economic reasons the systems will have a limited amount of primary storage. In one implementation, based on, for example, existing VCR usage patterns, there will be many occasions when the user will want to save or archive programs on the secondary storage device <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> for later viewing or archive the programs for later reference. The primary storage device <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> is preferably internal to DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and in electrical communication to an internal main bus for communication with other DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> elements through a data interface <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> such as a SCSI or IDE interface. In other embodiments, the primary storage device <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> can be externally connected to (and thus removable from) the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> via a communication port (for example, <highlight><bold>474</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>475</bold></highlight>) such as IEEE-1394 or USB or via a SCSI or an IDE interface. The primary storage device <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> is preferably a hard disk drive. The primary storage device <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> exhibits fast seek-time and high data transfer rates properties and its storage medium is preferably non-removable, such as in the case of a hard disk drive. Because the amount of data in one or more downloaded instances of PRM content typically surpasses the memory space allocated for application data in memory <highlight><bold>449</bold></highlight>, and because the primary storage device <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> features sufficiently large storage capacity, the primary storage device <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> serves, in one implementation, as a large repository or cache for downloaded PRM content. Alternatively, memory <highlight><bold>449</bold></highlight> may be large enough (and fast enough) to accommodate data transfers without the need for the primary storage device <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> In one implementation, under the auspices of the real-time operating system <highlight><bold>453</bold></highlight> executed by processor <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight>, and in coordination with PRM application client <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight>, downloaded PRM content and/or data is received in DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> via communications interface <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight> and stored in a temporary buffer in memory <highlight><bold>449</bold></highlight>. The temporary buffer is implemented and managed to enable data transfers from the temporary buffer to the primary storage device <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> in concert with the insertion of a newly arriving PRM content into the temporary buffer. The fast access time and high data transfer rate characteristics of primary storage device <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> enables PRM content and/or data to be read from the temporary buffer in memory <highlight><bold>449</bold></highlight> and written to the storage medium of primary storage device <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> in a sufficiently fast manner. Orchestration of multiple simultaneous data transfer operations is effected so that while content and/or data is being transferred from memory <highlight><bold>449</bold></highlight> to primary storage device <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>, new PRM content and/or data (herein media content) is received and stored in the temporary buffer. The coordination of data transfers and lower latency characteristics of primary storage device <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> enable PRM content to be received by DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> at high data rates. The primary storage device <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> functions to store media content that is received by the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> from the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> on an interim basis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> For permanent or semi-permanent storage, the secondary storage device <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> comprises a storage media drive, internally or externally connected to DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in a similar fashion as the primary storage device <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>, but featuring at least one high-capacity removable storage medium and, in one implementation, slower seek-time and lower data transfer rates characteristics. The secondary storage device <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> is preferably a multiple compact disc (CD) drive or multiple digital video disc (DVD) carousel or magazine drive that at least has write capability, but may also have read capability among other capabilities. Alternatively, the secondary storage device <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> may be a single CD drive or DVD drive with at least write capability, but may also have read capability among other capabilities, or a video recorder (VCR or D-VCR) or other data recorder. Alternatively, the carousel may be a magazine type. In one implementation, the media content that is received and stored on the primary storage device <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> is transferred by way of memory <highlight><bold>449</bold></highlight> to the secondary storage device <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> wherein it is written to one or more removable media residing in the secondary storage device <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>. The transfer of PRM content from primary storage device <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> to secondary storage device <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> can occur concurrently to the download of the respective PRM contain in a coordinated sequential fashion or after the respective PRM content has been completely received and stored in the primary storage device <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>. In the former case a second temporary buffer in memory <highlight><bold>449</bold></highlight> is utilized to implement the transfer of PRM content from the primary storage device <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> to secondary storage device <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>. Given its faster seek time and higher data transfer rate characteristics, primary storage device <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> preferably operates faster than the secondary storage device <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, PRM content is transferred from memory <highlight><bold>449</bold></highlight> to the secondary storage device <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> with higher data rate transfer characteristics, or yet in other embodiments, PRM content is transferred from a remote server or other remote device to a DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> communication port and then directly to the secondary storage device <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Also as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> preferably includes access to a printer <highlight><bold>458</bold></highlight>, either connected locally to the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> or via a home communication network via communication port <highlight><bold>474</bold></highlight>. In one implementation, the printer <highlight><bold>458</bold></highlight> prints labels to be applied to the removable media (i.e., CDs or DVDs) of the secondary storage device <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>. Preferably, these labels convey, at least, verification of purchase and authenticity of the data written to the media. Thus, in one implementation, labels are printed by the printer <highlight><bold>458</bold></highlight> as a result of an execution signal received by the printer <highlight><bold>458</bold></highlight> from the PRM application client <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> as a result of an authorized purchase of PRM content in which authorization was granted from the head end <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may operate without the printer <highlight><bold>458</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The PRM client application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> configures the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for the download, purchase, and billing of downloaded purchasable recordable media (PRM) content, including configuring the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for receipt of trial and impulse purchases of PRM content. The PRM application client <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> also provides for a user interface for specification of downloading options in cooperation with PRM application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) and in cooperation with other client applications, for example VOD <highlight><bold>463</bold></highlight> and PPV <highlight><bold>464</bold></highlight> and Music applications (not shown). Alternatively, the user interface may be provided from the head end <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Regarding the billing functionality, after a purchase transaction has occurred and the purchase is acknowledged, the purchase is recorded for billing purposes. In one embodiment, the PRM application client <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> configures the processor <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight> to cause PRM purchase transactions to be stored in the FLASH memory <highlight><bold>451</bold></highlight> part of system memory <highlight><bold>449</bold></highlight> or in some other designated non-volatile memory section of DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> as purchase transactions occur. PRM transaction records and associated fees are transmitted upstream via the OOB upstream channel at designated scheduled times (e.g., during low bandwidth consumption periods) to the billing system <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the PRM application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight>, under the direction of the billing system <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, may periodically poll individual DHCTs <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> or group of DHCTs to collect their respective PRM transaction history. PRM transaction records received from the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> by the PRM application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) are debited from the respective account of the subscriber by the billing system <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The PRM application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> also has library functionality for cataloging downloaded recordable media content. Media content information associated with PRM content is transmitted on a regular or periodic basis from PRM application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) to one or more DHCTs <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. PRM content information may comprise descriptive information to populate the entries of the first PRM database <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight> or a service guide or the corresponding PRM fields of an electronic program guide (EPG) that is presented to the subscriber via a Graphical-User-Interface (GUI) from which a subscriber can select and request additional descriptive information about respective PRM content titles. Hence, per PRM content information in the displayed presentation to the subscriber, the subscriber can retrieve and view (and hear if applicable) information specific to a PRM content title and proceed to purchase specific PRM content, as will be described in greater detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The PRM client application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> can offer the user a plurality of category choices, wherein the user may select from pre-configured categories from an input device such as a wired or wireless keyboard or remote control to classify downloaded PRM content into various categories. Alternatively, the user may enter textual information with an input device in order to create his or her own categories. Hence, downloaded PRM content can be recorded with modified or additional category information. In an alternate embodiment, a user can either download from the PRM application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight>, or transfer from a personal computer connected to a home communication network, additional information such as graphical information or a still picture to be included with the recording of the PRM content into recordable media inserted in secondary storage device <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>. PRM client application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> functionality further includes second database <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> management capabilities in which records of second database <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> can be stored in memory <highlight><bold>449</bold></highlight>, primary storage device <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>, or in a recordable disc inserted in secondary storage device <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>. Management of the second database <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> extends library functionality to the user for archiving PRM content as well as non-PRM content accessible via the secondary storage device <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> or a home communication network. Hence, the user is able to archive media content, perform searches (as extended by search capabilities inherent in the database management software program), and edit personal annotations such as the media content category, date recorded, etc. In one embodiment, subscriber network programming, such as for example cable programming, is first recorded/stored on the primary data buffer (for example, in primary storage device <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>) which is indexed by content ID and record date/time information (i.e. meta data). The minimum content ID information collected is the originating channel number but could include program ID (PID) or other media content and media content description information. The record date/time information is simply the date/time the recording was made and is used by the system for data management/purge) and can also be used by the subscriber as one of several methods to locate previously recorded media content. The media content recorded in the primary buffer (for example, primary storage device <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>) is available for viewing and disposition by the subscriber. Media content can be viewed, deleted, or spooled along with the data accessible by universal or widely adopted access and naming conventions (e.g., as is characteristically in meta data) to a secondary buffer (for instance, in secondary storage device <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>) for longer term storage and playback. Media content left in the primary buffer are subject to be overwritten by new media content. In one embodiment, the secondary buffer is located on removable media that can be stored for future playback. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is an example archive main screen <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> illustrating the archiving features provided by the PRM application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). Example archive main screen <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is preferably invoked after the user has received a purchase acknowledgement. Alternatively, example main screen may occur at the time of the download, or after the download, before or after the transfer to the secondary storage device <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>. The example archive main screen <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> includes a title header <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> suggesting to the user the purpose of the screen, and a subtitle header <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> indicating which hierarchical level of the archiving screen displays is currently displayed, in this instance, a main screen <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. Example main screen <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> includes an information window <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> that provides brief descriptive information, such as, for example, title, rating, date of composition, length of presentation, length of download and time and date of download. More or less information may be included. Example archive main screen <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> also includes several pre-configured lists, such as media content list <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight>, genre/descriptive list <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight>, and medium list <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>. Each of these pre-configured lists includes information within a series of list entry blocks <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight>. The information in these lists will preferably be defaulted to the selection corresponding to the shown highlighted list entry block <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight> of each list based on the characterizing information corresponding to the recordable media content selection. In one embodiment, this characterizing information can be received from the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) to enable the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to perform the archiving functionality. In other embodiments, this characterizing information need not be downloaded to a DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, but instead, can remain at the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> where the archiving functionality can be performed. Thus, genre/descriptive list <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> changes accordingly to the subscriber selection of a respective entry in media content list <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight>. For example, the genre/descriptive list <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> changes to a display corresponding to games displays upon the subscriber selecting games in media content list <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight>. Other embodiments are possible, such as a configuration screen (not shown) wherein the user categorizes the downloaded media content according to his or her own personal definitions or classifications. As another example, media content list <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight> includes such media content as movies, games, and software, as well as more media content options not shown. The default selection highlighted by highlighted list entry block <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight> corresponds to the fact that the downloaded media content is a movie, for example, Titanic. Genre/descriptive list <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> defaults to &ldquo;drama&rdquo; as this corresponds to the characterizing information of the Titanic, which lists the genre of Titanic as a &ldquo;drama&rdquo;. Although these are default selections, the user is free to scroll the highlighted list entry block <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight> of each list to enter his or her own preference for a category. For example, despite the pre-configured genre categorization of Titanic (e.g. drama), the user may choose to categorize Titanic as a romance, and thus advance the highlighted list entry block <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight> of the genre/descriptive list <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> to the list entry block <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight> containing the &ldquo;romance&rdquo; selection. As with any of the lists shown and described on the current and subsequent screens, the user may advance from one selection to the next selection within a list by using the up and down arrow keys of the remote control device, as suggested by up arrow <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> and down arrow <highlight><bold>534</bold></highlight>, as will be described in greater detail below. There are many variations of the scrolling function. Preferably, the user advances highlighted list entry block <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight> in each list up or down to highlight the list entry block <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight> containing the information desired. Alternatively, the windows in each list may be advanced through highlighted list entry block <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight>. The scope of the preferred embodiment of the invention is not limited to how the user advances to each list entry block <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight>. The user advances from one list, for example media content list <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight>, to another list, for example genre/descriptive list <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight>, by using scroll arrows on the remote, as suggested by scroll arrows <highlight><bold>536</bold></highlight>. Scroll arrows <highlight><bold>536</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>538</bold></highlight> correspond to scroll arrows located on a remote device <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight>, as will be described in more detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Category display <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> includes one example default format based on characterizing information corresponding to the purchased recordable media content. In this example, since Titanic is a &ldquo;movie&rdquo; of the &ldquo;drama&rdquo; genre, the category display <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> lists &ldquo;drama&rdquo; in an outline format and categorizes selections in this medium, DVD&num;1, as movies. Alternate formats may be displayed as well, such as personalized formats created by the user. The scope of the embodiments of the invention is not limited by how data is formatted on the screen displays. Assuming the Titanic purchase as the first purchased download by the user, the default will be to DVD&num;1. As illustrated, extended library functionality comprises the capability to not only to catalog media content but each individual medium (i.e., a CD disc or DVD disc) loaded in the carousel or magazine drive of secondary storage device <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) by the type (or category) of data stored on them. Category information may comprise, for example, types of music (such as classical, rock, or jazz), types of movies (such as comedy, drama, or horror), or types of software (such as games, word processing, or utilities). Sub-categories further delineate each category, for example, types of games. The library functionality determines if the appropriate disc is loaded in the secondary storage device <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) or prompts the user to load the secondary storage device <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> with the appropriate disc for the media content type that is to be recorded. For example, if rock &amp; roll music, transmitted from the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, is being recorded, the library functionality will control the selection of the appropriate medium, for example a CD from the carousel or magazine of the secondary storage device <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>, and load it into the drive for writing of the rock and roll music data to it, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. As another example, if the user chooses to view a drama movie, the library functionality will control the selection of the proper medium, in this case a DVD, from the carousel or magazine of the secondary storage device <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> and load into the drive for reading of the drama movie data in order to transmit it to a display device, such as for example, a TV display <highlight><bold>441</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the &ldquo;A&rdquo;, &ldquo;B&rdquo;, and &ldquo;C&rdquo; buttons on the example display screen correspond to like buttons on the remote control device <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> to provide certain user interface functionality. For instance, &ldquo;A&rdquo; button <highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight> suggests to a user that the user can request more PRM content information, as will be explained in greater detail below. The &ldquo;B&rdquo; button <highlight><bold>642</bold></highlight> suggests editing and search functionality, as will be described in greater detail below. Return Button &ldquo;C&rdquo; <highlight><bold>644</bold></highlight> suggests that the user can return to the main screen display wherein the purchase was made, for example a VOD catalog screen, or PPV screen. From the main screen display, the user can select &ldquo;play&rdquo; (not shown) to have the archived PRM content of his or her choice presented. The &ldquo;SEL&rdquo; button <highlight><bold>632</bold></highlight> suggests that the user can complete the archiving after making the selections in the pre-configured lists. Pressing the &ldquo;SEL&rdquo; button <highlight><bold>387</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>) on the remote control device <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight>, as suggested by select button <highlight><bold>532</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>), results in the example screen displayed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, as will be described in greater detail below. Buttons &ldquo;A&rdquo;-&ldquo;C&rdquo; (<highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>642</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>644</bold></highlight> respectively), arrow buttons <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>634</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>636</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>638</bold></highlight>, and &ldquo;SEL&rdquo; button <highlight><bold>632</bold></highlight> suggest a one-to-one functional correspondence to similar buttons on a remote device, such as the example remote control device <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. With continued reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates a block diagram example of a remote control device <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> that is used to provide user input to the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The arrow buttons <highlight><bold>382</bold></highlight> include an up arrow button <highlight><bold>383</bold></highlight>, a down arrow button <highlight><bold>384</bold></highlight>, a left arrow button <highlight><bold>385</bold></highlight>, and a right arrow button <highlight><bold>386</bold></highlight> that are used to scroll through options or selections and/or to highlight an option or selection displayed on one of the plurality of user interface screens. The select button <highlight><bold>387</bold></highlight> may be used to select a currently highlighted option or selection that is provided to the user. Lettered button &ldquo;A&rdquo; <highlight><bold>388</bold></highlight>, &ldquo;B&rdquo; <highlight><bold>389</bold></highlight>, and &ldquo;C&rdquo; <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> may be used to implement functions on a user interface screen that have the corresponding letter. Numeric buttons <highlight><bold>395</bold></highlight> may be used to enter numbers, or configured with the application to enter letters corresponding to the numeric buttons <highlight><bold>395</bold></highlight>. In describing the example screen displays, it will be understood that &ldquo;selecting&rdquo; or &ldquo;pressing&rdquo; the navigational and lettered buttons on the screen actually require selecting the corresponding buttons, or keys, on remote control device <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight>. Many alternative methods of providing user input may be used including a remote control device with different buttons and/or button layouts, a keyboard device, a voice activated device, etc. The embodiments of the invention described herein are not limited by the type of device used to provide user input. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a screen diagram that illustrates an example archive main screen <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> as a result of the user pressing the &ldquo;SEL&rdquo; button <highlight><bold>532</bold></highlight> in the archive main screen <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) to enter the movie Titanic under the &ldquo;drama&rdquo; subcategory in medium DVD&num;1. As noted, Titanic is displayed in category display <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> under the subcategory &ldquo;drama&rdquo; in outline format. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a screen diagram that illustrates an example archive main screen <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> wherein the user has entered another purchase of recordable media content, in this case, Suzie Floosey. The PRM client application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) recognizes Suzie Floosey as an adult movie from corresponding characterizing information delivered to the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and as similarly described above, defaults to each of these categories in the media content list <highlight><bold>924</bold></highlight> and genre/descriptive list <highlight><bold>922</bold></highlight>. As DVD&num;1 was used for movies by the same user, the default medium in the medium list <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight> is DVD&num;1. If the user purchasing the downloaded recordable media content was a different or second user, the default will preferably be to a different medium. For example, the default medium for the second user may be DVD&num;2, assuming no prior configurations by the second user, since characterizing information corresponding to the PIN entry of the user entered during the purchase of Suzie Floosey, as explained below, would reflect a different purchaser. Alternatively, the defaulted medium could be DVD&num;1, regardless of the purchaser, as the only DVD currently containing movie content, again assuming no prior configurations for movies. Note that the discussion regarding downloading to a DVD assumes that more than one movie may be downloaded to a DVD. In embodiments where the DVD allows only one movie to be downloaded, then the medium archiving aspect of said embodiment will select a distinct DVD per downloaded movie. Category display <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight> displays the current content on DVD&num;1, and automatically creates, as a default, the &ldquo;adult&rdquo; subcategory to correspond with genre/descriptive list <highlight><bold>922</bold></highlight>. As described earlier, the user may choose to describe the genre as a &ldquo;romance&rdquo;, and scroll to the corresponding selection in the genre/descriptive list <highlight><bold>922</bold></highlight>, whereby &ldquo;romance&rdquo; would appear in place of &ldquo;adult&rdquo; in the category display <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Upon the user entering the select button <highlight><bold>932</bold></highlight>, example archive main screen <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is presented, with the feature Suzie Floosey displayed in the category display <highlight><bold>1012</bold></highlight> under the &ldquo;adult&rdquo; subcategory, with a lock or PIN icon next to it to reflect PIN access authorization to view this media content instance presentation. The PIN access feature would have been determined during the purchase process. The PIN access entry icon may be displayed as a result of the user entering a PIN access number to purchase the media content instance, in accordance with the rating of the movie. Alternative icons or warning notices or messages alerting the user to PIN access entry requirements may also be employed. </paragraph>

Subtitle header <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> reflects the fact that the user is currently in the archive information screen <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>. The user selects up arrow <highlight><bold>1130</bold></highlight> and down arrow <highlight><bold>1134</bold></highlight> to advance highlighted list entry block <highlight><bold>1126</bold></highlight> in selection list <highlight><bold>1124</bold></highlight> to the desired selection. Selection list <highlight><bold>1124</bold></highlight> includes the current selections in the current medium, for example, DVD&num;1. Information corresponding to the selection in highlighted list entry block <highlight><bold>1126</bold></highlight> in the selection list <highlight><bold>1124</bold></highlight> is displayed in the information display <highlight><bold>1112</bold></highlight> to the right of selection list <highlight><bold>1124</bold></highlight>. PRM content information comprises data organized into records of first database <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) with record fields containing, but not limited to, information such as PRM content title, PRM content description, PRM genre, release year, casts or performers list, ratings information, and play duration. PRM content information also includes a plurality of prices (shown below) for each PRM content, with each respective price associated with a different downloading time and a download duration (shown below). PRM content information comprises additional information (not shown) such as a set of selectable downloading times with their respective price and respective approximate download durations. The effective window of calendar days in which respective PRM content is purchasable may also be included. Additional information may be included in aggregate fields to denote a PRM content instance rating and consequently support invoking parental control of media content via the PIN entry screen. Other fields designate information about the person that purchased and recorded the media content instance, the seller, the date purchased, the date recorded, and the method of sale (i.e., PRM purchase). Note that additional information about the highlighted selection in the selection list <highlight><bold>1124</bold></highlight> is available by selecting the &ldquo;A&rdquo; button <highlight><bold>1140</bold></highlight> to gain access to links to additional respective program related information such as program previews and the reviews and comments of critics.

<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is a screen diagram of an example archive edit screen <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> that extends library functionality by enabling a user to enter and/or edit certain personal annotations such as the media content category, date recorded, etc. Example archive edit screen <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> includes header <highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight> and subtitle header <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight>, which together reflect the fact that the current screen is an archive edit screen <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight>. Example archive edit screen <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> includes a category display <highlight><bold>1212</bold></highlight> for displaying the current selections on the current medium. Example archive edit screen <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> also includes an edit list <highlight><bold>1224</bold></highlight>, wherein the various categories that may be changed are listed. Since the medium title is presumably a popular target for modification, it is the selection defaulted to. Also, since the current archive edit screen <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> was invoked during the configuration for the DVD&num;1, DVD&num;1 is the highlighted default in the medium list <highlight><bold>1222</bold></highlight>. For example, the user has selected &ldquo;medium title&rdquo; from the edit list <highlight><bold>1224</bold></highlight> as a category the user seeks to change. Using scroll arrows <highlight><bold>1236</bold></highlight>, the user advances to the medium list <highlight><bold>1222</bold></highlight>, which is highlighted at the default selection of DVD&num;1 as described above. The user again uses scroll arrows <highlight><bold>1238</bold></highlight> to advance to the input window <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight>, wherein the user enters their personal title, &ldquo;John&apos;s Romantic Mix&rdquo; according to well-known methods for entering alphanumeric input on a remote device. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is a screen diagram of an example edit screen <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> responsive to the entry of John&apos;s Romantic Mix&rdquo; in the input window <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, wherein the medium title displayed in the category display <highlight><bold>1312</bold></highlight> reflects the change in title. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> To offer PRM service, in one implementation, the subscriber network television system operator assigns a portion of the downstream and upstream bandwidth capacity in the subscriber network television system to be dedicated for transmission of PRM content. The amount of bandwidth capacity that can be allocated to the PRM service is finite. Grants for request to download PRM content may be limited during peak-time periods that correspond to high bandwidth consumption by a plurality of other services. On the other hand, off-peak-time periods may feature unused bandwidth capacity intended for other services that can be repossessed for downloading of PRM content. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the amount of bandwidth capacity allocated for PRM service varies throughout time to reflect bandwidth consumption by a plurality of bandwidth consuming services, including but not limited to VOD services. During peak periods of other bandwidth consuming services such as, for example, video-on-demand (VOD), the amount of bandwidth capacity allocated to the PRM service is less than during the off-peak periods. Consequently, the duration for downloading a PRM content instance during peak-periods is typically longer than the duration for downloading a PRM content instance during off-peak-periods. For example, video on demand off-peak periods may run from 6:00 AM to 11:00 AM during the first week of May. Accordingly, the DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) at the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> will allot bandwidth for downloading PRM content by repossessing the off-peak bandwidth assigned to video on demand services via a plurality of DTC <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> channels (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, under coordination and communication between content manager <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> and PRM application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight>, PRM content is transferred from PRM application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> or other application servers (not shown) to VOD content server <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> via Ethernet connection <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> to effect PRM content delivery over repossessed unused bandwidth intended for VOD services. The DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> communicates the channel location where unused bandwidth is repossessed to subscriber DHCTs requesting PRM services (i.e. subscribers who have elected downloads of PRM content during these times) resulting in the tuner system <highlight><bold>445</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) of a requesting DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to tune to the corresponding channel to receive the downloadable PRM content. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the invention, again referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, under coordination and communication between content manager <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> and PRM application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight>, purchased PRM content that resides in the PRM application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> or in other application servers are transmitted for product delivery from the server wherein media content resides to the BFS server <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> via Ethernet connection <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>. A particular PRM content instance may reside indefinitely in BFS server <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> due to the high demand of that particular content or content instance, or temporarily during times of unused BFS bandwidth. In another embodiment, introduction of new media content releases, such as games or audio content, may reside in the BFS server <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> for a finite period, such as a month, starting from their introduction time. Alternatively, PRM content may reside in a BFS server <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> for periods of times in which BFS server <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> exhibits unused bandwidth capacity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> According to one implementation, bandwidth allocation for PRM service is managed according to a series of recurring sub-schedules consisting of a plurality of non-overlapping time intervals as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. &ldquo;N&rdquo; sub-schedules are illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, with the understanding that a plurality of sub-schedules may appear between sub-schedule &num;1 and sub-schedule &num;n. Time intervals are demarcated by time marks <highlight><bold>1510</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1520</bold></highlight>, etc on horizontal time axis <highlight><bold>1505</bold></highlight>, and represent times within a 24 hour period. The interval between these time marks, such as between time marks <highlight><bold>1510</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1520</bold></highlight>, represent a period during the 24 hour period, for example, 12:00 AM to 4:00 AM. The time mark <highlight><bold>1530</bold></highlight>, continuing the example, would represent 5:00 AM, and its interval will span to time mark <highlight><bold>1540</bold></highlight>, which may be 8:00 AM. The corresponding bandwidth allotted during these time intervals is represented by the blocks over the corresponding time intervals, such as block <highlight><bold>1590</bold></highlight> over the second time interval bordered between time marks <highlight><bold>1510</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1520</bold></highlight>. Allocated bandwidth goes from, for example, zero <highlight><bold>1501</bold></highlight> at the intersection of the horizontal time axis <highlight><bold>1505</bold></highlight> and vertical bandwidth axis <highlight><bold>1507</bold></highlight> in sub-schedule&num;1 to increasing bandwidth when advancing up from zero <highlight><bold>1501</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the time intervals vary in length and are established with demarcation according to collected historical data of bandwidth consumption patterns for a plurality of services. Allocation of bandwidth capacity may vary between one time interval to the next. Pricing for each respective PRM content instance may or may not vary in each of the respective time intervals according to whether the time interval is a peak period or not. For example, during peak periods, such as 6:00 to 10:59 P.M. of the week nights, the recurring schedule may exhibit higher pricing for PRM services whereas during certain, low-demand time periods such as 6:00 to 11:00 A.M of the weekend days the pricing will be lower. As disclosed below, other factors such as demand for new releases and popular media content may also influence pricing. Therefore, allocation of bandwidth capacity for PRM services may be configured to adapt in a time-specific manner according to a plan. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The allocated bandwidth PRM services may be configured to switch as time progresses from a first allocation sub-schedule to a second allocation sub-schedule according to a main schedule that specifies the time interval when each of two or more sub-schedules is to be active as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. As noted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, the plan may consist, in one embodiment, of scheduling for the year with multiple schedules <highlight><bold>1610</bold></highlight>, further administered with fewer schedules on a per week basis <highlight><bold>1620</bold></highlight>, and administered with even fewer schedules on a daily basis <highlight><bold>1630</bold></highlight>. For example, only one configurable sub-schedule is active at a time throughout the configurable recurring schedule but a first configurable sub-schedule may be active throughout one or more distinct and non-overlapping time intervals of the configurable recurring schedule. The recurrence of the schedule is configured to one of a plurality of time periods such as a weekly, daily, or a monthly recurring schedule. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> According to another possible bandwidth allocation schedule, a multiplicity of time-adaptive schedules for each of a multiplicity of recurring schedule choices are pre-configured. In this embodiment, the cable system operator may monitor the bandwidth and PRM service usage and be given the option of manually implementing one of the pre-configured allocation schedules without following a plan. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) may automatically monitor bandwidth usage and automatically select one of the pre-configured schedules. For instance, six different configurations may be available for time-adaptive management of the bandwidth allocated for PRM services for a daily recurring schedule. On the other hand, more than six different arrangements may be necessary when implementing time-adaptive bandwidth management on a weekly recurring schedule. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The pricing system and the allocated bandwidth are inherently related, as the price structure will depend on, among other factors, the time of the download and the duration of the download. In a subscriber network television system that markets PRM content with a plurality of prices, a first subscriber may be willing to pay a premium to immediately download a PRM content instance that is purchased during a peak-period. A second subscriber pays a lesser purchase fee when purchasing a PRM content instance during a peak-period but selecting to downloaded the purchased PRM content instance at a later time corresponding to an off-peak period. In one embodiment, the PRM service offers a plurality of prices for a PRM content instance, and each respective price is associated with a different downloading time and a download duration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> In one implementation wherein VOD excess bandwidth capacity is employed to fulfill a PRM content instance purchase request, and with continued reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 &amp; 4</cross-reference>, a &ldquo;session&rdquo; between the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the PRM application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> is set throughout the course of downloading the PRM content instance. Upon the subscriber purchasing a PRM content instance for a price via the displayed user interface (i.e. the subscriber enters input via an input device and such input may comprise a password or PIN to authenticate authorization to purchase the PRM content instance), as will be described below in greater detail, a purchase transaction is executed by the processor <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight>, as configured by the PRM application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight>, that causes a session to be set-up between subscriber network television system resources to the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. As facilitated by session manager <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> in DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>), a session is a logical entity used to define a connection between the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the VOD content server <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> and the resources used to maintain that connection in the subscriber network television system. Session manager <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> coordinates and effects the signaling required to implement the session which is preferably defined by the MPEG-2 standard ISO/IEC 13818-6 IS (MPEG-2 DSM-CC). Upon a session setup request generated by the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (usually in response to a request from a subscriber), the DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> verifies the eligibility of the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to receive the PRM service. The amount of bandwidth that will be reserved for the duration of the PRM service session is communicated to the relevant servers and headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> components. Via the messaging capabilities of DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight>, the PRM application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> sends a message to the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> that indicates that it is ready to begin delivering the video content using the resources allocated. The DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> receives information in the message identifying the QAM modulator that is transmitting the video content (and hence where to tune to receive the requested content) and the bandwidth allocated to deliver the service. After a session has been established, the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> communicates directly with the PRM application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> to facilitate delivery of the requested PRM service. Throughout the course of time that a PRM service is active, further messaging is conducted between the respective DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> receiving the PRM content and the PRM application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> to monitor the status of the session. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> There are a variety of options available to the user for purchasing PRM content. In one embodiment, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, the user is presented with an interactive program guide (IPG) <highlight><bold>1770</bold></highlight> which has PRM icons next to varied media content selections, suggesting to the user the availability of a downloadable and recordable option for those selections, as indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. The icons, and their screen coordinates, can be stored locally as an attribute in each program (i.e. media content) record, like stereo or second audio program (SAP) attributes. The program records can be stored in a database in the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, for example an EPG database or first PRM database <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the program records can be maintained at the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Any application can display the icon after, for example, the program title in the applications&apos; GUI presentation (e.g. IPG application <highlight><bold>1770</bold></highlight>). For example, selections Saving Private Ryan and American History under the PPV category <highlight><bold>1776</bold></highlight> have icon &ldquo;CD/DVD&rdquo; next to them suggesting to the user that these selections are available for downloading to a recordable medium, such as a CD or DVD. In another embodiment, the user may be presented with a service guide (SG) option <highlight><bold>1876</bold></highlight> such as the example IPG <highlight><bold>1890</bold></highlight> depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>. Upon selecting the service guide (SG) option <highlight><bold>1876</bold></highlight>, the user is presented with service selections in a service guide (SG) as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> is a screen diagram of an example user service guide (SG) that provides for a plurality of services <highlight><bold>1956</bold></highlight> with CD/DVD icons to alert the user to the ability (or inability) to purchase recordable media content. For example, the CD/DVD icon next to the PPV <highlight><bold>1957</bold></highlight>, VOD <highlight><bold>1958</bold></highlight>, Music <highlight><bold>1959</bold></highlight>, software <highlight><bold>1960</bold></highlight>, and Games <highlight><bold>1965</bold></highlight> services suggests to the user that these services include selections that are downloadable to a recordable medium. Alternatively, the PRM service <highlight><bold>2075</bold></highlight> may be a selectable service entity, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>. Selecting the PRM service <highlight><bold>2075</bold></highlight> from the service guide <highlight><bold>2050</bold></highlight> may present various media content options that are purchasable recorded media content, categorized, for example, in media content categories such as music, movies, software, etc. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> is a screen diagram of an example VOD selection screen display <highlight><bold>2170</bold></highlight> responsive to the user entering the VOD catalog selection <highlight><bold>1958</bold></highlight> in the example service guide <highlight><bold>1950</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>. A similarly formatted screen may be presented, for example, if the user selects from the service guide <highlight><bold>1950</bold></highlight> (in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>) a PPV selection <highlight><bold>1957</bold></highlight>, or music selection <highlight><bold>1959</bold></highlight>, or software selection <highlight><bold>1960</bold></highlight>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>, the user is presented with a screen display <highlight><bold>2111</bold></highlight> that includes a select button <highlight><bold>2176</bold></highlight>, which provides the user the ability to rent or purchase the highlighted selection <highlight><bold>2173</bold></highlight>. By pressing the select button <highlight><bold>2176</bold></highlight>, the user is presented with a user interface screen (not shown) that provides the user with an option to either download (purchase) the selected item for recording and thus for indefinite personal possession (i.e. buy), or rent. The PRM service is also integrated into the VOD catalog, in one embodiment, as another option (like price). In one implementation, the system operator may choose what VOD content is available for PRM service and then programs the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> accordingly. In another implementation, the content provider may offer certain VOD content with PRM service, which is then a feature provided to the user through the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Once the user selects the download option (not shown), the user will be presented with the example PRM service screen illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>, and which will be described below. Note that the screen display <highlight><bold>2111</bold></highlight> also includes an information button <highlight><bold>2177</bold></highlight>, which enables the user to learn more about the selection they seek to purchase or rent. If the user selects rent, conventional VOD processing occurs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Another segue into the pricing system may be by way of an impulse purchase made available during the presentation of a particular media content instance. For example, the user may presented with a pop-up message anytime during the presentation of a VOD movie or a PPV event, which asks the user if he or she would be interested in purchasing this event as PRM content. The pop-up message may occur as an overlay on presented media content in the display screen, or the media content presentation window may narrow to allow the message to appear, or any other manner to present the message on the display screen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Once the user has decided on a media content selection for downloading, either by entering a selection in an IPG, a service guide, or during the presentation of a particular media content instance as part of an impulse purchase, the user is presented with an example purchase screen <highlight><bold>2200</bold></highlight>, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>. In one embodiment, this purchase screen <highlight><bold>2200</bold></highlight> may be invoked as a mini-program located within the PRM application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> &ldquo;called&rdquo; by another application, for example, during a VOD session when the user has selected the purchase option over the rental option, or during a media content instance presentation from a service upon the user requesting an impulse buy. Alternatively, PRM application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> functionality may exist as a sub-routine within the current media service application in session. Alternatively, PRM functionality may exist as software in the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Purchase screen <highlight><bold>2200</bold></highlight> includes title header <highlight><bold>2201</bold></highlight> identifying the media service from which the PRM content instance will be purchased. Subtitle header <highlight><bold>2202</bold></highlight> suggests the purpose of the purchase screen <highlight><bold>2200</bold></highlight>, which is to select download and price options. The reduced screen area <highlight><bold>2212</bold></highlight> displays an image from the media content to be purchased. Assuming that the movie selection was Titanic, a picture of a representative scene for the highlighted movie may be presented. Similarly, pictures of representative spreadsheets from a software selected may be displayed, or a picture of a song artist may be displayed for the music selection, all mentioned by way of example. Information section <highlight><bold>2210</bold></highlight> contains some characterizing information about the media content purchase, including but not limited to media content title, date of composition, rating, download time, and available purchase window. Content quality index <highlight><bold>2220</bold></highlight> provide the user with content quality options, such as, for example, high definition television or standard definition, surround sound, etc. As with other user interface screens described previously, the user preferably advances highlighted window <highlight><bold>2222</bold></highlight> over a window <highlight><bold>2224</bold></highlight> containing the desired content quality by using left scroll arrow <highlight><bold>2226</bold></highlight> or right scroll arrow <highlight><bold>2228</bold></highlight>. Selections preferably advance until an end is reached in the list, or alternatively, selections may &ldquo;wrap-around&rdquo; in a manner whereby the selections repeat themselves. Download option list <highlight><bold>2246</bold></highlight> contains download options. The user advances the highlighted list entry block <highlight><bold>2240</bold></highlight> over the list entry block <highlight><bold>2242</bold></highlight> containing the desired download option by using up arrow <highlight><bold>2262</bold></highlight> and down arrow <highlight><bold>2268</bold></highlight>, and a corresponding price for that option and content quality is displayed in the price window <highlight><bold>2260</bold></highlight>. The user presses the select button <highlight><bold>2264</bold></highlight> to purchase the desired selection. The user may select the &ldquo;B&rdquo; more movie information button <highlight><bold>2230</bold></highlight> to learn more details about the movie the user is about to purchase. The user may also select the &ldquo;C&rdquo; movie purchases button <highlight><bold>2232</bold></highlight> to return to the main media content screen, for a example, the VOD catalog screen as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>, to consider other movie purchases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> The price assigned to each available download option may depend on a number of factors. Demand for a PRM content instance such as for new releases and popular media content instances may influence pricing. The amount of bandwidth consumed to download the PRM content instance (and hence the download duration), the time of day, the day of the week (weekday, weekend, or holiday), and the amount of time that the subscriber has to wait until the downloading operation starts also influence the price. Other factors influencing pricing of a PRM content instance include the PRM content type (e.g., audio, movie, or game), the PRM content quality (e.g., CD quality or surround sound quality audio; standard or high-definition picture quality), and the delivery mode (e.g., repossessed VOD excess bandwidth or via BFS services). For example, in the example purchase screen <highlight><bold>2200</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>, the user highlights an immediate download option, but with a latent duration ending an hour from the purchase as noted in download option list <highlight><bold>2246</bold></highlight>. Further, the user has indicated a desire for high definition video with standard sound as indicated by the highlighted content quality window <highlight><bold>2222</bold></highlight>. Price window <highlight><bold>2260</bold></highlight> shows that the resultant price for this price configuration is $9.99. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference> is a screen diagram that illustrates an example purchase screen <highlight><bold>2300</bold></highlight> wherein the user has selected a longer download duration that encroaches on a traditionally off-peak time for VOD, for example, early morning. An 8:00 AM download is highlighted in download option list <highlight><bold>2346</bold></highlight> with the same content quality as the prior screen. As noted, the price for the purchase, as displayed in price window <highlight><bold>2360</bold></highlight> decreases significantly from the prior highlighted option in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>. Also note the increase in the download duration as shown in the information section <highlight><bold>2310</bold></highlight>, as the download in this option is allowed to &ldquo;trickle&rdquo; to the requesting DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference> illustrates an example purchase screen <highlight><bold>2400</bold></highlight> for the same download option as that shown for <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>, but with the user scrolling to and highlighting in content quality index <highlight><bold>2420</bold></highlight> a standard definition, standard sound option. The result, as displayed in the price window <highlight><bold>2460</bold></highlight>, is an even lower price than the high definition standard sound option highlighted in the prior purchase screen <highlight><bold>2300</bold></highlight>, due to the lower bandwidth requirement of standard definition video downloads when compared to high definition downloads. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference> is a screen diagram of an example purchase screen <highlight><bold>2500</bold></highlight> that illustrates another download option, wherein the download will not begin until 8:00 AM, typically a low demand period for VOD, but it will be immediate starting at 8:00 AM. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference> is a screen diagram of an example purchase screen <highlight><bold>2600</bold></highlight> that illustrates another download option wherein the download begins later, and is of longer duration than the prior download option illustrated in example purchase screen <highlight><bold>2500</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference> is a screen diagram of an example purchase screen <highlight><bold>2700</bold></highlight> that illustrates the trial purchase option. The purpose of the trial purchase is to promote &ldquo;teaser&rdquo; sales. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> and continued reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27, a</cross-reference> trial purchase includes the receipt to the primary storage device <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) of the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of an entire media content instance, such as but not limited to music, video, or software, and then the subsequent transfer to the secondary storage device <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) for a limited time period. The secondary storage device <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) medium, either a CD or DVD, is time stamped for valid decryption only for a specified time period. The content would continue to reside on the storage medium but could not be used. For example, the downloaded trial purchase may be encrypted in a manner that allows for the primary storage device <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> to read the decrypted PRM content, but is prevented from being downloaded to the secondary storage device <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>. As time stamping is well known to those having ordinary skill in the art, further discussion need not be presented. Trial purchases could be used to promote teaser sales. As with any purchase, parental controls, such as, by way of non-limiting example a PIN entry screen, would be implemented, as described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference> is a screen diagram depicting an example PIN entry window <highlight><bold>2800</bold></highlight> that is presented to the user after the user selects a download and content quality selection in one of the prior example purchase screens, such as, for example, example purchase screen <highlight><bold>2600</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>. A PIN Entry window <highlight><bold>2800</bold></highlight> is employed during the purchase of a PRM content instance to authenticate authorization to purchase and exercise parental control of purchases. The top portion <highlight><bold>2810</bold></highlight> contains the heading &ldquo;PIN ENTRY&rdquo; while the bottom portion <highlight><bold>2820</bold></highlight> illustrates relevant navigation buttons <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, available on the remote control device <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). A user can enter his or her PIN using the remote control device <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) while being presented with the PIN entry window <highlight><bold>2800</bold></highlight>. Center portion <highlight><bold>2830</bold></highlight> contains entry fields <highlight><bold>2840</bold></highlight> that display a &ldquo;*&rdquo; for every PIN entry received from the user. In an alternative embodiment a user is not presented with a PIN entry screen and is not required to enter a PIN. In yet another alternative embodiment, a user is only presented with a PIN entry screen if the selected download can be achieved. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference> is a screen diagram of an example screen display <highlight><bold>2900</bold></highlight> denying the user from purchasing the selected content, for example, a VOD selection. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference> is a screen diagram of an example screen display <highlight><bold>3000</bold></highlight> acknowledging the purchase of the selection, and providing the user the opportunity to accept or cancel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference> is a screen diagram depicting an example barker screen <highlight><bold>3100</bold></highlight> resulting when a particular subscriber request for a PRM content instance cannot be fulfilled for lack of available bandwidth or other reasons. This screen <highlight><bold>3100</bold></highlight> may be presented after the user makes a PIN entry, or alternatively, after the user makes their download and content selections. Top portion <highlight><bold>3151</bold></highlight> contains a heading describing the problem to the user, a bottom portion <highlight><bold>3152</bold></highlight> illustrating relevant navigation button(s) available on the remote control device <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>), and a top center portion <highlight><bold>3153</bold></highlight> which provides the user with a message, for example: &ldquo;SORRY, PRM SERVICE IS CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE. SELECT AN AVAILABLE OPTION OR &ldquo;C&rdquo; TO CANCEL&rdquo;. Download option list <highlight><bold>3154</bold></highlight> provides the user with a list of available download options and their content quality and price. As described earlier, communication occurs between the PRM client application and the PRM application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> when content is downloaded to maintain the status of the download. Errors or aborted attempts at the download of PRM content is thus known at the PRM client application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight>, resulting in the generation of the example barker screen <highlight><bold>3100</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference>. Alternatively, this screen can be generated at the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The PRM client application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> will also generate the download option list <highlight><bold>3154</bold></highlight> as part of the example barker <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> according to the mechanisms used to initially generate the download options for the PRM purchase screens, such as example purchase screen <highlight><bold>2200</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>). The user may use up arrow <highlight><bold>3164</bold></highlight> or down arrow <highlight><bold>3164</bold></highlight> to advance the highlighted window <highlight><bold>3166</bold></highlight> over the option window <highlight><bold>3168</bold></highlight> containing the desired download option. The user may then enter their selection by pressing the select button <highlight><bold>3162</bold></highlight>. Example barker <highlight><bold>3100</bold></highlight> is sent from the PRM application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) notifying the subscriber that their request could not be fulfilled. Alternatively, the unavailability of the selected PRM during the selected download times may be communicated by the PRM application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) to the PRM client application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>), wherein the PRM client application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) generates this example barker <highlight><bold>3100</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, a screen may be presented such that the user is presented with a button to select alternative download options from the one of the purchase screens described and illustrated above. Alternatively, a subscriber may be asked to accept a PRM content instance over a longer download duration but at the same price as a result of lack of bandwidth capacity or lack of VOD bandwidth availability for reuse. Consequently, upon subscriber consent, the PRM application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) employs other available bandwidth capacity using in-band or out-of-band BFS services or a combination thereof. Numerous unique combinations of PRM content delivery may be employed when lacking bandwidth resources. </paragraph>
