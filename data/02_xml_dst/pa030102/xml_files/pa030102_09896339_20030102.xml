<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to the art of optical micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) devices, and more particularly, to all-optical switching using MEMS devices. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> One solution for all-optical switching employs two MEMS devices each containing an array of tiltable micro mirrors, e.g., small mirrors, which can reflect light, which herein refers to any radiation in the wavelength of interest, whether or not in the visible spectrum. An optical path is established for light supplied from an input source, e.g., an optical fiber, to an output, e.g., an output fiber, by steering the light using a first micro mirror on the first optical MEMS device, the first micro mirror being associated with the input fiber, onto a second micro mirror on the second optical MEMS device which is associated with the output fiber. The second micro mirror then steers the light into the output fiber. Each fiber connected to the system is considered a port of the system, the input fibers being the input ports and the output fibers being the output ports. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Often, the light to be steered from the input fiber onto the first micro mirror of the first optical MEMS device first passes through a micro lens that is associated therewith and is part of an input micro lens array. The function of each micro lens is to collimate the beam of light supplied from its respective associated input fiber. Alternatively, in lieu of employing a separate micro lens array, a lens may be integrated with each fiber of fiber bundle in an arrangement that forms a collimator. A similar arrangement of a micro lens array or collimators are also found interposed between the output MEMS device and the output fiber bundle in the output section of the all-optical switch. In the output section, the function of each micro lens is to couple the light beam into its respective associated output fiber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> At present, the tilt angle of a micro mirror is set by applying to one or more electrodes appropriate voltages. Unfortunately, using current electrostatic angle control technology, the tilt resulting for a particular control voltage is a highly non-linear function. Consequently, requiring less tilt tends to allow the angle desired to be more accurately achieved. As a result, all-optical switches tend to include the functionality of a so-called &ldquo;field lens&rdquo; between the MEMS devices. The field lens causes beams reflected from untilted mirrors on a MEMS device to converge. This acts to translates the angle at which the light is incident onto each micro mirror into a position to which the light will be directed upon reflection from the micro mirror, thereby allowing all the input micro mirrors to be homogenized. By homogenized it is meant that all micro mirrors having the same tilt will direct their light to the same position. Furthermore, the field lens refocuses each of the beams that pass through it, thus reducing loss. However, use of the field lens does not decrease the distance that is required between the input and output MEMS devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Because the all-optical switch is typically made up of sets of mirrors that cooperate to switch light from any input port to any output port, the entire system needs to be aligned to achieve the best possible optical connections, i.e., the least loss from the input to the output. To this end it must be determined what voltages need be applied to the electrodes controlling each mirror to achieve the best connection between it and each other mirror of the opposing set, and what voltage needs to be applied to the electrodes of each of the opposing mirrors as well. This process of determining the voltages is known as &ldquo;training&rdquo;. When a field lens is used, the entire optical switch must be trained as a unit because there are variations from one system to the next due to variations in the respective field lenses and in the mounting position. This training process is time consuming and must be repeated should any component need to be replaced. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> We have recognized that the field lens can be eliminated, while the same effect as if a field lens had been included in the system is maintained by, in accordance with the principles of the invention, causing the beams between a MEMS device and an input source or an output, e.g., a fiber bundle, to be closer to each other at the MEMS device than at the fiber bundle. This can be achieved in a variety ways. In one embodiment of the invention in which each fiber is associated with a respective micro lens of a micro lens array, by insuring that there is a different distance between the centers of adjacent micro lenses than there is for the centers of their corresponding adjacent fibers. In another embodiment of the invention in which the fibers are terminated by collimators, the direction of the collimators can be adjusted to point the beams in a converging manner. In yet another embodiment of the invention, an optical system that changes the direction of various ones of the beams may be interposed between a) the fiber bundle, and any associated micro lens array or collimators, and b) the corresponding MEMS device. Such an optical system could be any focusing lens arrangement, a multiple prism arrangement, and a multiple mirror arrangement where each mirror is tilted to point the beams in a converging manner. Furthermore, the optical system could be combined with an imaging system to image the micro lenses or collimators onto the MEMS device. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The following merely illustrates the principles of the invention. It will thus be appreciated that those skilled in the art will be able to devise various arrangements which, although not explicitly described or shown herein, embody the principles of the invention and are included within its spirit and scope. Furthermore, all examples and conditional language recited herein are principally intended expressly to be only for pedagogical purposes to aid the reader in understanding the principles of the invention and the concepts contributed by the inventor(s) to furthering the art, and are to be construed as being without limitation to such specifically recited examples and conditions. Moreover, all statements herein reciting principles, aspects, and embodiments of the invention, as well as specific examples thereof, are intended to encompass both structural and functional equivalents thereof. Additionally, it is intended that such equivalents include both currently known equivalents as well as equivalents developed in the future, i.e., any elements developed that perform the same function, regardless of structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Thus, for example, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that any block diagrams herein represent conceptual views of illustrative circuitry embodying the principles of the invention. Similarly, it will be appreciated that any flow charts, flow diagrams, state transition diagrams, pseudocode, and the like represent various processes which may be substantially represented in computer readable medium and so executed by a computer or processor, whether or not such computer or processor is explicitly shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The functions of the various elements shown in the FIGS., including any functional blocks labeled as &ldquo;processors&rdquo;, may be provided through the use of dedicated hardware as well as hardware capable of executing software in association with appropriate software. When provided by a processor, the functions may be provided by a single dedicated processor, by a single shared processor, or by a plurality of individual processors, some of which may be shared. Moreover, explicit use of the term &ldquo;processor&rdquo; or &ldquo;controller&rdquo; should not be construed to refer exclusively to hardware capable of executing software, and may implicitly include, without limitation, digital signal processor (DSP) hardware, network processor, application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), field programmable gate array (FPGA), read-only memory (ROM) for storing software, random access memory (RAM), and non-volatile storage. Other hardware, conventional and/or custom, may also be included. Similarly, any switches shown in the FIGS. are conceptual only. Their function may be carried out through the operation of program logic, through dedicated logic, through the interaction of program control and dedicated logic, or even manually, the particular technique being selectable by the implementer as more specifically understood from the context. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In the claims hereof any element expressed as a means for performing a specified function is intended to encompass any way of performing that function including, for example, a) a combination of circuit elements which performs that function or b) software in any form, including, therefore, firmware, microcode or the like, combined with appropriate circuitry for executing that software to perform the function. The invention as defined by such claims resides in the fact that the functionalities provided by the various recited means are combined and brought together in the manner which the claims call for. Applicant thus regards any means which can provide those functionalities as equivalent as those shown herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Software modules, or simply modules which are implied to be software, may be represented herein as any combination of flowchart elements or other elements indicating performance of process steps and/or textual description. Such modules may be executed by hardware which is expressly or implicitly shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Unless otherwise explicitly specified herein, the drawings are not drawn to scale. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Additionally, unless otherwise explicitly specified herein, any lens shown and/or described herein is actually an optical system having the particular specified properties of that lens. Such an optical system may be implemented by a single lens element but is not necessarily limited thereto. Similarly, where a mirror is shown and/or described what is actually being shown and/or described is an optical system with the specified properties of such a mirror, which may be implemented by a single mirror element but is not necessarily limited to a single mirror element. This is because, as is well known in the art, various optical systems may provide the same functionality of a single lens element or mirror but in a superior way, e.g., with less distortion. Furthermore, as is well known in the art, the functionality of a curved mirror may be realized via a combination of lenses and mirrors and vice versa. Moreover, any arrangement of optical components that are performing a specified function, e.g., an imaging system, gratings, coated elements, and prisms, may be replaced by any other arrangement of optical components that perform the same specified function. Thus, unless otherwise explicitly specified here, all optical elements or systems that are capable of providing specific function within an overall embodiment disclosed herein are equivalent to one another for purposes of the present disclosure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The term micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) device as used herein is intended to mean an entire MEMS device or any portion thereof. Thus, if a portion of a MEMS device is inoperative, or if a portion of a MEMS device is occluded, such a MEMS device is nonetheless considered to be a MEMS device for purposes of the present disclosure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In the description, identically numbered components within different ones of the FIGS. refer to the same components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows an exemplary arrangement for performing optical switching in accordance with the principles of the invention. Shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> are a) input fiber bundle <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, b) input micro lens array <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, c) input MEMS device <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, d) output MEMS device <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>, e) output micro lens array <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>, f) output fiber bundle <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>, and g) lenses <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Input fiber bundle <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> supplies optical signals to be switched. More specifically, each fiber of input fiber bundle <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is an input port to the switching system of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The light supplied by each fiber of fiber bundle <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> passes through a respective corresponding micro lens that is part of micro lens array <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. The function of each micro lens is to collimate the beam of light supplied from its respective associated input fiber. In alternative embodiments of the invention, in lieu of employing a separate micro lens array, a lens may be integrated with each fiber of fiber bundle <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> in an arrangement that forms a collimator, so that the light comes out as a parallel beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the principles of the invention, the beams of light passing from micro lens array <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> each falls upon lens <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> which is arranged to cause the beams from the micro lens array and/or the collimators to converge. Thus, the beams will no longer be parallel and any beam not through the center of lens <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> will have a change in direction. Those beams below the lens center will be bent to travel up while those beams above the lens center will be bent to travel down. In one embodiment of the invention, the optical path of the all-optical switch is such that the focal point of lens <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> lies on output MEMS device <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Each micro mirror of input MEMS device <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is set to reflect the beam of light incident on it at a respective prescribed angle. The particular prescribed angle is selected so that the beam will be directed to a prescribed micro mirror on output MEMS device <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> that corresponds to the particular fiber of output fiber bundle <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> to which the light is being directed as an output. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> After reflecting off of its particular micro mirror of input MEMS device <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, each beam of light falls upon a respective micro mirror of output MEMS device <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. Each micro mirror of output MEMS device <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> is set to reflect the beam of light incident on it at a respective prescribed angle. The particular prescribed angle is selected so that each light beam will be directed towards the respective fiber of output fiber bundle <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> which is to be the output fiber for the light beam after it passes through lens <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> After reflecting off of its particular micro mirror of output MEMS device <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> and prior to reaching its respective output fiber, each beam of light passes through lens <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>, which is arranged so as to cause the beams from the micro lens array and/or the collimators to diverge so that when they emerge from lens <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> they are substantially parallel. Thus, the beams will become again substantially parallel, or at least they will diverge less, and any beam not through the center of lens <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> will have a change in direction. In one embodiment of the invention, the optical path of the all-optical switch is such that the focal point of lens <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> lies on input MEMS device <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The beams of light passing from lens <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> passes through a respective micro lens of micro lens array <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. The function of each micro lens is to collimate the beam of light supplied to its respective associated input fiber. In alternative embodiments of the invention, in lieu of employing a separate micro lens array, a lens may be integrated onto each output fiber of fiber bundle <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>, thus forming a collimator. The light from each of micro lens of micro lens array <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> then passes into the respective output fiber bundle that is associated with the micro lens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Note that in lieu of lens <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and/or lens <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> any other optical system that changes the direction of the beams individually may be employed, e.g., any focusing lens arrangement, a multiple prism arrangement, a multiple mirror arrangement where each mirror is tilted so as to point the beams in a converging manner, or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows another arrangement, in accordance with an aspect of the invention, for causing the beams to converge, or which is able to receive diverging beams, in an all-optical switch. In the arrangement of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> the fibers of fiber bundle <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> are terminated by collimators <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, and the direction of collimators <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> are adjusted to point the beams in a converging manner. Similarly, in the reverse direction, due their pointed arrangement, collimators <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> may receive beams of light that are diverging and couple the beams into their respective associated fibers. As indicated above, since collimators <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> are employed, there is no need to use micro lens array <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. The arrangement of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> may be used in lieu of either fiber bundle <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, micro lens array <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and lens <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> or fiber bundle <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>, micro lens array <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> and lens <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>. The degree of convergence is determined by the implementer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows yet another arrangement, in accordance with an aspect of the invention, for causing the beams to converge, or which is able to receive diverging beams, in an all-optical switch. In the arrangement of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, each fiber of fiber bundle <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> is associated with a respective micro lens of micro lens array <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> and there is a different distance between the centers of adjacent micro lenses than there is for the centers of their corresponding adjacent fibers. This arrangement produces converging beams. Similarly, in the reverse direction beams of light that are diverging may be coupled into their respective associated fibers. Thus, the arrangement of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> may be used in lieu of either fiber bundle <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, micro lens array <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and lens <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> or fiber bundle <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>, micro lens array <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> and lens <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>. The degree of convergence is determined by the implementer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows a further arrangement, in accordance with an aspect of the invention, for causing the beams to converge, or which is able to receive diverging beams, in an all-optical switch. In the arrangement of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> micro prism <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>, which may be part of a micro prism array, is associated with each fiber of fiber bundle <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>. Each associated fiber and micro prism are further associated with a respective micro lens of micro lens array <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>. Light beam from each of fiber of fiber bundle <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> is redirected by the fiber&apos;s associated micro prism <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> to be converging with other light beams from the other fibers of fiber bundle <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, and the associated micro lens array <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> collimates the beam. The order in the optical path of the micro prism and the micro lens is not material. The tilt of each prism should be different so as to converging beams. Similarly, in the reverse direction beams of light that are diverging may be coupled into their respective associated fibers. Thus, the arrangement of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> may be used in lieu of either fiber bundle <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, micro lens array <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and lens <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> or fiber bundle <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>, micro lens array <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> and lens <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>. The degree of convergence is determined by the implementer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows yet another arrangement, in accordance with an aspect of the invention, for causing the beams to converge, or which is able to receive diverging beams, in an all-optical switch. In the arrangement of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the micro lens array, e.g., micro lens array <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is integrated with its respective associated one of lens <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>. The order in the optical path of the lens and the micro lens array, or even individual lenses of the micro lens array, is not material. Thus, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is fiber bundle <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> along with lens <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight> on which has been integrated micro lenses <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>. This arrangement produces converging beams. Similarly, in the reverse direction beams of light that are diverging may be coupled into their respective associated fibers. The degree of convergence is determined by the implementer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows an exemplary arrangement for performing optical switching that employs an imaging system interposed between the MEMS device and a fiber bundle to image the fiber bundle on the MEMS device and to make the beams converging at the input or diverging at the output, in accordance with the principles of the invention. Shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> are a) input fiber bundle <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, b) input micro lens array <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, c) input MEMS device <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, d) lens <highlight><bold>607</bold></highlight>, e) lens <highlight><bold>609</bold></highlight>, f) output MEMS device <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>, g) lens <highlight><bold>617</bold></highlight>, h) lens <highlight><bold>619</bold></highlight>, i) output micro lens array <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>, and j) output fiber bundle <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Input fiber bundle <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> supplies optical signals to be switched. More specifically, each fiber of input fiber bundle <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is an input port to the switching system of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The light supplied by each fiber of fiber bundle <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> passes through a respective corresponding micro lens that is part of micro lens array <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. The function of each micro lens is to collimate the beam of light supplied from its respective associated input fiber. In alternative embodiments of the invention, in lieu of employing a separate micro lens array, a lens may be integrated with each fiber of fiber bundle <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> in an arrangement that forms a collimator, so that the light comes out as a parallel beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the principles of the invention, the beams of light passing from micro lens array <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> each falls upon the imaging system made up of lenses <highlight><bold>607</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>609</bold></highlight>, entering at lens <highlight><bold>607</bold></highlight> and exiting at lens <highlight><bold>609</bold></highlight>. The imaging system is arranged so as to cause an image of the micro lens array and/or the collimators to be formed at input MEMS device <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, or vice-versa, due to the reversible nature of optics, thus effectively eliminating the distance between micro lens array and/or collimators <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and input MEMS device <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> over which the light beams had effectively traveled in prior art arrangements. The imaging system is further arranged, in accordance with the principles of the invention, to cause the beams of light from each input fiber to be converging when they are incident on MEMS device <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> regardless of their original orientation when exiting fiber bundle <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. Thus, advantageously, each light beam, even if not traveling initially in its intended direction due to errors in the fiber-micro lens alignment does not get the opportunity to travel away from its intended target and furthermore, the light beams are oriented so as to be converging. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Note that although two lenses are shown making up the imaging system, this is for pedagogical and clarity purposes only. Those of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that any imaging system, e.g., a system using one or more lenses, may be employed. Also note that since the imaging system may be inverting the respective corresponding micro mirrors of input MEMS device <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> may not be in the exact same location, e.g., on a direct line from input fiber bundle <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> as they would have been had the imaging system not been employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The imaging system may also change the size of the image as compared with the original. This would allow the micro mirrors of input MEMS device <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> to have a different size and/or spacing than that of micro lens array and/or collimators <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. It would also allow the use of a fiber bundle without a micro lens array and/or collimators if the fill factor, i.e., the ratio between the spot size and the distance between the spots, between the fiber bundle and the micro mirrors of the MEMS device is substantially maintained. Furthermore, it is possible to employ optical splitters, e.g., between lenses <highlight><bold>607</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>609</bold></highlight>, to create multiple signal paths through the system, e.g., to implement a multicast, broadcast, monitoring, protection and restoration functions. Advantageously, great flexibility in system design is achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Each micro mirror of input MEMS device <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is set to reflect the beam of light incident on it at a respective prescribed angle. The particular prescribed angle is selected so that the beam will be directed to a prescribed micro mirror on output MEMS device <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> that corresponds to the particular fiber of output fiber bundle <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> to which the light is being directed as an output. Any error that results from the light having entered the imaging system traveling along a direction that is not parallel to the line formed by the center of its lens or collimator and its associated micro mirror is compensated for by the &ldquo;training&rdquo; of the all-optical system so long as deviation angle of the light from the parallel is small compared to the maximum angle at which the mirror can be tilted. &ldquo;Training&rdquo; is the process of determining what voltages need be applied to the electrodes each mirror to achieve necessary tilt that provides the best connection between it and each other mirror of the opposing set, and what voltage needs to be applied to the electrodes of each of the opposing mirrors as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> After reflecting off of its particular micro mirror of input MEMS device <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, each beam of light falls upon a respective micro mirror of output MEMS device <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. Each micro mirror of output MEMS device <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> is set to reflect the beam of light incident on it at a respective prescribed angle. The particular prescribed angle is selected so that each light beam will be directed towards the respective fiber of output fiber bundle <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> which is to be the output fiber for the light beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> After reflecting off of its particular micro mirror of output MEMS device <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> and prior to reaching its respective output fiber, each beam of light passes through lens <highlight><bold>617</bold></highlight> and then lens <highlight><bold>619</bold></highlight>, which together form an imaging system. The imaging system is arranged so as to cause an image of output MEMS device <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> and/or the collimators to be formed at output micro lens array <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> and/or collimators <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>, or vice-versa, due to the reversible nature of optics, thus effectively eliminating the distance between output MEMS device <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> and micro lens array and/or collimators <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> over which the light beams had effectively traveled in prior art arrangements. The imaging system is further arranged, in accordance with the principles of the invention, to cause the beams of light from output MEMS device <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> to be diverging when they are incident on micro lens array <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> regardless of their original orientation when they were reflected off of MEMS device <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. Thus, advantageously, each light beam, even if not traveling in the desired direction due to errors in alignment does not get the opportunity to travel away from its intended target and furthermore, the light beams are oriented so as to be diverging. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> As previously indicated in connection with the lens of the input imaging system, although two lenses are shown making up the output imaging system, this is for pedagogical and clarity purposes only. Those of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that any imaging system, e.g., a system using one or more lenses, may be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Note that the imaging system may also change the size of the image as compared with the original. This would allow the micro mirrors of output MEMS device <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> to have a different size and/or spacing than that of micro lens array and/or collimators <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. It would also allow the use of a fiber bundle without a micro lens array and/or collimators if the fill factor, i.e., the ratio between the spot size and the distance between the spots, between the fiber bundle and the micro mirrors of the MEMS device is substantially maintained. Furthermore, it is possible to employ optical splitters, e.g., between lenses <highlight><bold>617</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>619</bold></highlight>, to create multiple signal paths through the system, e.g., to implement a multicast, broadcast, monitoring, protection and restoration functions. Advantageously, great flexibility in system design is achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The beams of light passing from lens <highlight><bold>619</bold></highlight>, which are now substantially parallel, or at least less diverging, pass through a respective micro lens of micro lens array <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. The function of each micro lens is to collimate the beam of light supplied to its respective associated input fiber. In alternative embodiments of the invention, in lieu of employing a separate micro lens array, a lens may be integrated onto each output fiber of fiber bundle <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>, thus forming a collimator. The light from each of micro lens of micro lens array <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> then passes into the respective output fiber bundle that is associated with the micro lens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Note that in some embodiments of the invention only one imaging system need be employed. In such embodiments the imaging system may be employed only for the input or only for the output. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Note, that in other embodiments of the invention the imaging system may be separate from the arrangement which causes the beams to converge/diverge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The physical size of the arrangement may be reduced by compacting the optical path, e.g., using appropriate conventional mirrors, and/or employing folded arrangements, i.e., arrangements in which there is only one MEMS device stage that does double duty for both input and output through the use of at least one conventional mirror. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Note that instead of optical fibers supplying the light beams as inputs, they may be supplied by an optical source, e.g., a laser or light emitting diode, planar wave guides, or the like. Likewise, instead of having optical fibers receiving the light beams as outputs the light beams could be received by other receivers such as photo detectors, planar wave guides, or the like. </paragraph>
