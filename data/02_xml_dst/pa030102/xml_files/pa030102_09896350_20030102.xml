<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A method and apparatus is disclosed for a handheld device for enriching the device&apos;s ability for applications such as speech recognition. In the following description, in some instances, specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances well known circuits, processes and the like, have not been described in detail in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The term handheld device refers to a handheld one-way or two-way wireless paging computer, a wireless enabled palm-top computer, a mobile telephone with data messaging capabilities or like handheld devices. In the following description, the word &ldquo;application&rdquo; is sometimes used to indicate a computer program operating on a processor, for instance, a microprocessor, microcontroller or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> handheld device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is illustrated which includes a generally rectilinear housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> fabricated from a material such as plastic. The interior of the housing contains a printed circuit board for the electronics needed to operate the handheld device, such as a microprocessor, memory, and other logic. The front face of the housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> includes a display <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> as well as buttons <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, three (3) dual port microphones are incorporated into the housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. A first dual ported microphone includes one port <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>A incorporated into the front face of the device and a second port <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>B incorporated into the upper surface of the handheld device. A second microphone includes a first port <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>A incorporated into the front face of the handheld device and a second port <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>B incorporated into the bottom of the device as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. A third microphone, includes a first port <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A incorporated into the front face of the device and second port <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>B incorporated into the bottom of the housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Also incorporated into opposite sides of the housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are two manually operated switches <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>B. One switch, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>B, is visible in the perspective view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and the other switch, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A, is visible in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. These switches protrude from the surface of the housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> so that they may be readily activated by the fingers or palm when the device is held in the hand. The depressing of either or both of the switches is detected in software as an event, specifically, a press-to-talk event or speech event. Therefore, when the switch is pressed, it is assumed that a user is speaking into the microphones of the handheld device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The dual port microphones are widely used in noise cancellation applications. One port of the microphone faces the expected source of the speech which is to be captured and the other port is disposed in a surface facing away from the expected source of speech. Thus, the intensity of speech is greater at one port than the other. Both ports, however, receive background noise. These microphones, in effect, subtract out the noise and provide a first level of noise cancellation. The dual ports of each microphone provide an audio analog signal representing the speech directed at the handheld device. While three dual ported microphones are shown in the drawings, more than three may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> As shown is <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the analog audio signal from each of the three dual port microphones is coupled to a digital-signal-processor (DSP) <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> on one of the lines <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the DSP <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> after digitizing the analog signal from each microphone, processes the multiple audio streams by using algorithms for background noise cancellation and automatic gain control. The DSP <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, for instance, takes the digitized audio streams to triangulate which audio source (which microphone) is closest to the speaker. Once that is determined, the two other audio sources (the other microphones) that are not nearest the speaker are used for additional background noise rejection. In effect, as known in the prior art, a three-dimensional cone is created with the three audio streams. This enables the distinction between noise and speech. Moreover, the cone moves dynamically as the position of the source of the speech changes relative to the position of the handheld device. As is typically the case, as one speaks into a handheld device, there is relative motion between the speaker and the device as the head and hand move. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the DSP <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> performs automatic gain control to compensate for how far the handheld device is held from the speaker and for changes in the speaker&apos;s volume during speech input. The speaker&apos;s volume can change during speech input through movement of the handheld device as described above in connection with the cone. The automatic gain control can compensate for these changes and provide a speech recognition engine with a constant level audio signal which improves recognition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The output of the DSP <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is a single stream of digitized signals representing speech which is connected on line <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> to a buffer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The buffer provides storage for the audio stream, for instance, in dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) or static random-access memory (SRAM). In one embodiment, the buffer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> stores approximately one second of speech. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The DSP <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and buffer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> are shown under the bracket &ldquo;Handheld HW.&rdquo; In one embodiment, specific hardware such as the DSP <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and a buffer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are used to provide a single audio stream with the nose cancellation and gain contact. The bracket to the right of the buffer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, identified as &ldquo;Handheld OS&rdquo; is used to indicate that in one embodiment, the remainder of the processing occurs in software. This software may be part of the operating system (OS) of the handheld device. This includes the audio driver <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, which provides a pulse code modulated audio signal to an application <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The output of the buffer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is coupled through the driver <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> into the application <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> where, for instance, voice recognition occurs. In practice, the DSP algorithms are tuned for compatibility with the speech recognition engine of the application <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> One important aspect of providing clear speech recognition involves the ability to rapidly recognize when speech input is occurring. Providing the user the ability to easily input speech is important. Thus, one issue when capturing speech is determining how a user might begin a speech event. In may cases, a user may begin speaking at the exact moment or slightly before a press-to-talk switch is depressed. Additionally, there will always be a delay between when the switch event occurs and when the application recognizes that the event occurred. Part of the speech may be lost, not only because the user depresses the switch late, but also because of the time required for the application to recognize that the switch is depressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, presampling of the speech occurs as will be discussed. Additionally, a real-time event handler is used to reduce the delay in reporting the event to the application <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. This requires frequent monitoring of the state of the switches in order to detect a change in the state of one or both of the switches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Audio is continuously captured by the microphones of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> (even if it is only background noise) and processed through the DSP <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. The last, for instance, second of audio is stored within the buffer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The buffer thus retains a moving window in time of audio which preceeds the activation of one or both of the press-to-talk switches <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>B. This is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> on the time line <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Assume that one or both of the switches <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A or <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>B is depressed at time <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> (speech event). Prior to that time, presampled audio of, for example, one second has been stored in the buffer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. At time <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, the application receives the indication of the speech event. Time <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> thus represents the latency period between the speech event and the actual recognition of such event by the application <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Between time <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, any speech occurring is processed. At time <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, the speech event ends as sensed by the release of the press-to-talk switches. When the application is first notified of the event, (time <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>), the audio stored within the buffer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is first processed by the application <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Thus speech that may have occurred prior to time <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and during time <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is captured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Acccordingly, the presampling of the audio signal allows an application interested in the speech input to listen to any speech occurring prior to the speech event. When a speech event notification does arrive, the application can include the pre-determined period of the audio stream that is buffered prior to the speech event in the overall processing. Additionally, by using real-time event notification, the application can rely on the fact that the time frame from the time of the speech event to when the application is notified is fixed, (e.g. time <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>). An application that uses the presampling mechanism is more immune to speech starting before or during a speech event and is thus able to provide the user a much richer speech experience by not misrecognizing speech input in this context. It also allows for a wide variety of speech input behavior by the user rather than enforcing stricter requirements on the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The use of the two press-to-talk switches, one on either side of the handheld device, allows a right-handed or left-handed person to more easily use the device. It eliminates the need for users to alter their behavior on how they would naturally hold or use a handheld device. The depression of either or both of these press-to-talk switches, as mentioned, is detected by software as a speech event. Tuned switch drivers for rapid notification of a speech event are used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Thus, an improved handheld device providing enhanced speech recognition has been disclosed. </paragraph>
