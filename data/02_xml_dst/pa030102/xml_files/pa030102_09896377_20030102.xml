<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A laser transmitter bias circuit for a laser diode transmitter, for use in a optical transmission system, e.g. in commercial CATV systems. The laser transmitter bias circuit reduces power consumption and heat dissipation by eliminating the conventional need for a distinct constant DC current supply for biasing the laser diode. Radio frequency (RF) circuitry, e.g., a radio frequency amplifier (e.g., a Hybrid Amplifier), connected in series to the laser diode supplies both a DC bias-current (I<highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>) and an RF drive-current (I<highlight><subscript>P</subscript></highlight>) through the laser diode. The DC bias current through the laser diode in turn powers (and/or biases) the radio frequency amplifier and, optionally, other radio frequency circuitry. An optional diode-bypass current (I<highlight><subscript>BP</subscript></highlight>) path may be connected in parallel with the laser diode, and in series with the radio frequency amplifier to control bias current. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Technical Field </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to a semiconductor laser drive circuit, more particularly, to a semiconductor laser drive of use in an optical transmitter, having immediate applications in commercial CATV systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Commercial terrestrial Cable Television (CATV) systems typically utilize optical links (e.g., fiber-optic cable, with RF transmitter-receiver pairs) to carry radio frequency (RF) digital signals over long distances. The light-producing component is typically a semiconductor laser diode operating in forward bias mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The forward bias of the semiconductor laser diode is maintained by a DC current generally referred to as the bias current (I<highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>). A semiconductor laser emits light when a diode current (I<highlight><subscript>D</subscript></highlight>) flowing through it exceeds a threshold value (I<highlight><subscript>TH</subscript></highlight>), the value of which may vary from diode to diode, and may vary in a particular diode during operation due to operational conditions such as temperature. Generally, the bias current I<highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>is controlled so as to establish and maintain the relation I<highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>&ap;I<highlight><subscript>TH</subscript></highlight>. Radio frequency (RF) signals expressed as a RF modulated electrical current (I<highlight><subscript>P</subscript></highlight>) are superimposed upon the DC bias current (I<highlight><subscript>B,</subscript></highlight>) through the laser diode to obtain modulated light signals that will carry the RF information long distances (e.g., through a fiber optic cable physically and optically coupled to the laser diode). The current flowing through the laser diode (I<highlight><subscript>D</subscript></highlight>) during operation is therefore equal to the sum of the currents I<highlight><subscript>P </subscript></highlight>plus I<highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>. The amperage of bias current I<highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>can be larger or smaller than the maximum amplitude of RF modulated current I<highlight><subscript>P</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is derived from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> of U.S. Pat. No. 5,563,898, issued to Ikeuchi, (incorporated herein by reference except for the parenthetical references to &ldquo;ground&rdquo; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 13</cross-reference> thereof) and is representative of the related art&apos;s approach to supplying bias current (I<highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>) and RF modulated electrical current (I<highlight><subscript>P</subscript></highlight>) to the laser diode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The related art generally teaches that a distinct drive-current (I<highlight><subscript>P</subscript></highlight>) supply unit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (powered by the full supply voltage V<highlight><subscript>DD</subscript></highlight>) plus a distinct bias-current (I<highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>) supply unit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> (connected between GND and the laser diode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>), are both necessary to provide and regulate the current I<highlight><subscript>D </subscript></highlight>(e.g., I<highlight><subscript>D</subscript></highlight>&equals;I<highlight><subscript>P</subscript></highlight>&plus;I<highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>) through the laser diode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The related art generally teaches that the such a distinct bias-current (I<highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>) supply unit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> should be connected in parallel with the drive-current (I<highlight><subscript>P</subscript></highlight>) supply unit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> between a terminal (Node<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) of the laser diode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and ground. Thus, in the related art, the electrical power that is consumed in the drive-current (I<highlight><subscript>P</subscript></highlight>) supply unit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to provide bias current (I<highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>) to the laser diode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is essentially dissipated as waste heat, and does not power the operation of the drive-current (I<highlight><subscript>P</subscript></highlight>) supply unit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the semiconductor laser drive circuits of the related art are not as power-efficient as the present invention discloses that a semiconductor laser drive circuit can be. There is a need for a power efficient method and apparatus for transmitting RF signals through an optical medium. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The present invention overcomes the disadvantages of the semiconductor laser drive circuits of the related art. The disclosed invention has applications in cable television (CATV) distribution networks as well as in many other applications involving fiber-optic transmission of RF signals. RF digital signals that may be transmitted using the inventive semiconductor laser drive circuits and methods may include QAM (e.g., M-ary Quadrature Amplitude Modulated), Baseband, QPSK and other types. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention exploits the observation that a typical semiconductor laser diode, such as laser diode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, typically operates with a significant bias current (I<highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>) but with a forward bias voltage drop (V<highlight><subscript>FB</subscript></highlight>) across its terminals (i.e., measured between Node <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and Node <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) that is very small compared to supply voltage V<highlight><subscript>DD </subscript></highlight>needed to operate RF components such as a drive-current supply unit (e.g., an RF Amplifier). The present invention further exploits a discovery that such RF components generally can operate at a reduced supply voltage V<highlight><subscript>D </subscript></highlight>that is less than the typical full supply voltage V<highlight><subscript>DD </subscript></highlight>(e.g., Vdd&equals;24 volts), and that V<highlight><subscript>D </subscript></highlight>may be equal to V<highlight><subscript>DD </subscript></highlight>minus V<highlight><subscript>FB</subscript></highlight>. Accordingly, the invention provides semiconductor laser drive circuits wherein the DC bias current (I<highlight><subscript>B,</subscript></highlight>) through the laser diode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is used to power the RF components of the laser drive circuits (e.g., in <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) rather than being dissipated as heat (e.g., in <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>), and thus eliminating the need for a distinct bias-current (I<highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>) supply unit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> as was required in the related art circuit shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> As already noted, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is block diagram depicting an overview of a typical topology of the semiconductor laser drive circuits of the related art. During operation, the bulk of the current I<highlight><subscript>D </subscript></highlight>passing through the semiconductor laser diode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> will be conducted into and through the distinct bias-current supply unit (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>) and will be therein dissipated as waste heat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a block diagram depicting a general topology of a RF laser drive circuit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> wherein the laser diode&apos;s (<highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>) bias current (I<highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>) is provided by and powers at least the output stage of an RF amplifier <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> (and/or other RF circuitry <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>) connected in series with the laser diode (<highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>), in accordance with embodiments of the invention. The RF circuitry <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> may generally comprise RF circuits ordinarily present in the RF stages of a RF laser transmitter. The term &ldquo;RF circuitry&rdquo; as used in the claims will not include a DC current path between the laser diode <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and ground GND that is provided solely to pass DC bias current I<highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>nor a portion thereof. The diode <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> (referred to generally herein as a laser diode) may be identical to the laser diode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> employed in the related art as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, or any laser diode now or ever known to persons skilled in the art. Alternatively, the &ldquo;laser&rdquo; diode <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> may be a simple light emitting diode (LED), or diode <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> may be a plurality of parallel-connected (i.e., connected in parallel between Node<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and Node<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) LEDS and/or laser diodes (e.g., outputting various lightwave frequencies, polarizations, and/or phases). The radio frequency signal RF is supplied to the RF circuitry <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and used therein to modulate the drive-current I<highlight><subscript>P</subscript></highlight>, and may be transmitted (as the RF modulated light) through an inventive RF digital signal transmission system (see, e.g., <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>). The radio frequency signal RF may be and/or include QAM (e.g., M-ary Quadrature Amplitude Modulated), Baseband, QPSK and other known types of signals. The radio frequency signal RF, although nominally, &ldquo;radio frequency&rdquo; may be presented to the nominal RF circuitry <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of the circuit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> at lower than &ldquo;radio&rdquo; frequencies, (e.g., at audio frequencies or at much higher frequencies) as individual device (e.g., diode, capacitor, transistor) characteristics permit. The RF circuitry <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to be supplied by the laser diode&apos;s (<highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>) bias current (I<highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>) at V<highlight><subscript>D </subscript></highlight>on Node<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may include an RF amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> or at least the RF output stage thereof. The RF circuitry nominally labeled <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> may be and represent any one of the specific and alternative embodiments of RF circuitry depicted in subsequent Figures, e.g., <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>C, <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>D or of many other specific alternative embodiments that would be known by persons skilled in the art (e.g., the circuit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> in the Ikeuchi patent, when supplied by V<highlight><subscript>D </subscript></highlight>rather than V<highlight><subscript>DD</subscript></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In the topology of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the laser diode&apos;s (<highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>) DC bias current (I<highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>&ap;I<highlight><subscript>TH</subscript></highlight>) is the same as the current powering the RF circuitry <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> (which includes circuits that function as a drive-current supply unit and circuits that function as a bias-current supply unit) within the RF laser drive circuit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. RF circuitry <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> passes both the RF drive-current I<highlight><subscript>P </subscript></highlight>and the DC bias current (I<highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>). At any given supply voltage V<highlight><subscript>DD</subscript></highlight>, the power consumed (and heat dissipated) by laser diode <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> (e.g., laser diode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) plus RF circuitry <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> operating in the topology of circuit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> will generally be less than (e.g., sometimes half) the power that would be consumed to control and power the laser diode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> plus the RF circuitry (e.g, within drive current supply unit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) operating in the topology of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The power consumption of the entire RF laser drive circuit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> will be independent of the laser diode&apos;s (<highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>) current (I<highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>) requirements. Specifically, in various embodiments of the invention, the optical power output P<highlight><subscript>O </subscript></highlight>of laser diode (<highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>) during operation, will have no significant effect upon the total power consumption of (and heat dissipated in) the RF laser drive circuit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a block diagram depicting a general topology of an RF laser drive circuit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>A similar to circuit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, wherein a current controller <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is added (in series and/or in parallel with the laser diode <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>) to regulate the DC current I<highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>flowing through the laser diode <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and into the RF circuitry <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> (e.g., including RF amplifier <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>) connected in series with the laser diode <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. The laser diode-bypassing current controller <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> functions to regulate the current <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>through the laser diode <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and/or to supply necessary current to power the RF circuitry <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The current controller <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may be implemented with one or a plurality of transistors (as in supply unit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> of the Ikeuchi patent) or variable resisters, potentiometers, etc. connected in series, and/or in parallel with the laser diode <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. In many cases (and by design), the DC current required by the RF circuitry <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> will be greater than the bias current (I<highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>&ap;I<highlight><subscript>TH</subscript></highlight>) of the laser diode <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. Thus, in many cases the current controller <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> will be implemented as a parallel laser-bypass current (I<highlight><subscript>BP</subscript></highlight>) path (e.g., having controllable resistance) connected parallel to the laser diode <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> between Node<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and Node <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The laser-bypass current (I<highlight><subscript>BP</subscript></highlight>) combines with the bias current (I<highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>&ap;I<highlight><subscript>TH</subscript></highlight>) through the laser diode <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> at Node<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and enters and powers the RF circuitry <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Thus, the RF circuitry <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> passes the RF drive-current I<highlight><subscript>P </subscript></highlight>and the DC bias current (I<highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>) and DC diode bypass-current (I<highlight><subscript>BP</subscript></highlight>). The composite DC current I<highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>&plus;I<highlight><subscript>BP </subscript></highlight>supplies the current required to power the RF circuitry <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The addition of the laser-bypassing current (I<highlight><subscript>BP</subscript></highlight>) path in parallel with the laser diode <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> does not reduce the power efficiency of the circuit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>A (e.g., versus the power efficiency of circuit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> as implemented without such a bypass current) because all the current I<highlight><subscript>AMP </subscript></highlight>supplied to the RF circuitry <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is usefully employed to power the RF circuitry <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, rather than dissipated as waste heat. </paragraph>

RF Amplifier <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>B includes a single transistor T<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>connected between Node<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the diode <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and GND, (e.g., a bipolar transistor T<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>that may be biased to a quiescent state with current I<highlight><subscript>AMP </subscript></highlight>supplied from Node<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> at reduced supply voltage V<highlight><subscript>D</subscript></highlight>. The RF Amplifier <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>B amplifies the radio frequency voltage signal RF and transforms that signal into RF modulated current (I<highlight><subscript>P</subscript></highlight>) which is used in the forward biased laser diode <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> to create RF modulated light. The current I<highlight><subscript>AMP </subscript></highlight>includes the laser bias current (I<highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>) plus any laser-bypassing current (I<highlight><subscript>BP</subscript></highlight>) passing through the current controller <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>B). Thus, the RF circuitry <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>B (e.g., comprised of single transistor) passes the RF drive-current I<highlight><subscript>P </subscript></highlight>and the DC bias current (I<highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>) and any DC diode bypass-current (I<highlight><subscript>BP</subscript></highlight>). </paragraph>

A lowpass filter (i.e., a filter that passes DC current, but which blocks RF signals), e.g., LOWPASS<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (including inductor L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and capacitor C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), may be provided within the laser-diode bypassing current (I<highlight><subscript>BP</subscript></highlight>) path (i.e, within current controller <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>B), to direct the RF modulated current (I<highlight><subscript>P</subscript></highlight>) that is controlled by the RF circuitry <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> (including <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>C, and <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>D as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4, 5</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> respectively) exclusively through the laser diode <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, rather than through the current controller <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>B.

In alternative embodiments of the invention, the single-transistor RF amplifier may be replaced with any conventional amplifier circuit that would have the appropriate DC and RF characteristics between Node<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and GND, such as for example a Darlington transistor set, and other multiple-transistor amplifiers, and the push-pull amplifier circuits of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>

The push pull (Hybrid) amplifier, as will be well understood by persons skilled in the art, operates in conjunction with a RF phase splitter <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> to transform the signal RF into RF modulated current (I<highlight><subscript>P</subscript></highlight>) superimposed upon a DC bias current (which passes alternately through transistors Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) that will be equal to I<highlight><subscript>BP </subscript></highlight>plus I<highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>(or less than I<highlight><subscript>BP </subscript></highlight>plus I<highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>if some current supplied from Node<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> at reduced supply voltage V<highlight><subscript>D </subscript></highlight>is simultaneously used to power the RF phase splitter or other RF components within RF circuitry <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>C).
