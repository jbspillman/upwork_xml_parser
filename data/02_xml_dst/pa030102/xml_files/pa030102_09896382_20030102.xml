<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a communication system, and is more particularly related to a network restoration architecture for supporting telecommunication services and networks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Discussion of the Background </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Submarine cable networks continue to provide a viable solution for joining geographically dispersed sites. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows a typical submarine cable network, which connects continents A and B together over three separate cables that terminate at three separate sets of nodes. Traditionally, the cables <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> are operated by different service providers, largely in part because of the cost of cable deployment. In a typical submarine cable network build, capacity is usually shared among these different service providers, who own the cable, to meet the requirements of their subscribers (i.e., customers). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Therefore, conventional submarine cable builds do not offer much network protection, as these different service providers do not possess a viable mechanism to manage the collective network. It is noted that although the terrestrial portion of a service provider&apos;s network may provide availability as high as 99.999%, the vulnerability of deep water cable cuts and associated long MTTR (Mean Time To Repair), the overall availability may be greatly reduced. With the forecasted growth in IP (Internet Protocol) traffic for example, exponential growth in international traffic is expected. The availability requirements for premium services are ever increasing and demanding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In light of the network management constraints of the service providers associated with cables <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>, these service providers have little flexibility in offering a diverse range of service level agreements (SLA). For instance, if the service provider of cable <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> experiences a peak traffic level that exceeds the capacity of cable <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, this service provider may or may not divert overflow traffic to the other two service providers, depending on the traffic load of these other service providers. In addition, the susceptibility to a single point of failure may preclude the service provider of cable <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> from providing many different types of SLAs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Based on the foregoing, there is a clear need for improved approaches for providing network restoration and provisioning services in submarine systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> There is also a need to enhance network availability in systems that utilize submarine cables. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> There is a further need to increase network management functionalities in submarine systems to provide a variety of service level agreements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Based on the need to enhance the network availability, an approach for implementing a network protection mechanism in a submarine cable network is highly desirable. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The present invention addresses the above stated needs by providing a capability to restore and provision services over a submarine network. The submarine network, which may exhibit a number of different network topologies, utilizes nodes that terminate each end of the submarine cables. The nodes include terminating equipment that monitors the submarine cables for alarms. The alarms are stripped by binary interfaces within the terminating equipment and forwarded to a network management module or system, which in turn instructs a switch to retrieve an appropriate restoration or provisioning plan. The restoration is automatically performed through a series of pre-programmed instructions; the restoration may be executed on a per-fiber strand basis or per-fiber cable basis. Additionally, the network management module manages the capacity of the submarine network to provide provisioning services. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> According to one aspect of the invention, a method is provided for providing network management of a submarine cable network. The method includes monitoring a plurality of physical connections between a first line terminating equipment and a second line terminating equipment. The method also includes selectively receiving alarm signals from at least one of the first line terminating equipment and the second line terminating equipment. Further, the method includes reconfiguring the submarine cable network based upon the receiving step. Under this approach, availability of submarine networks is enhanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the invention, a communication system for providing network management of a submarine cable network comprises a line terminating equipment that is configured to monitor a plurality of physical connections of the submarine cable network. A network management module is configured to receive selectively an alarm signal from the line terminating equipment and to reconfigure the submarine cable network based upon the received alarm signal. The above arrangement advantageously provides efficient restoration of services in the event of network faults associated with the physical connections of a submarine network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In another aspect of the invention, a computer-readable medium carrying one or more sequences of one or more instructions for providing network management of a submarine cable network is provided. The one or more sequences of one or more instructions include instructions which, when executed by one or more processors, cause the one or more processors to perform the step of monitoring a plurality of physical connections between a first line terminating equipment and a second line terminating equipment. Another step includes selectively receiving alarm signals from at least one of the first line terminating equipment and the second line terminating equipment. Yet another step includes reconfiguring the submarine cable network based upon the receiving step. This approach advantageously enhances efficiency of provisioning services in a network that utilize submarine cables. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In yet another aspect of the invention, a communication system for providing network management of a submarine cable network comprises means for monitoring a plurality of physical connections of the submarine cable network. The system also includes means for selectively receiving alarm signals from the monitoring means, and means for reconfiguring the submarine cable network based upon the received alarm signals. Under this approach, service level agreements can be ensured.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In the following description, for the purpose of explanation, specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. However, it will be apparent that the invention may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well-known structures and devices are depicted in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The present invention accomplishes reconfiguration of a submarine network to restore services in the event of network faults and to perform service provisioning. A telecommunications node includes a line terminating equipment that monitors physical connections of the submarine cable network. The system utilizes binary interfaces as well as network management interfaces to detect the network faults; whereby, if the fault goes undetected by the binary interfaces, then the network management interfaces provide another mechanism to trigger network restoration. Although the present invention is discussed with respect to optical networking, it is recognized by one of ordinary skill in the relevant art that the present invention has applicability to communications networks in general. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> shows a submarine cable network that is capable of performing network reconfiguration, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. It is recognized that the cost of deployment of intercontinental cabling has diminished in cost; accordingly, carriers may build new cables to provide shared protection links for working capacity of existing cables. As shown in the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A, a</cross-reference> switching system <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> resident in Continent A, for example, is used to connect a submarine Line Terminating Equipment (SLTE) <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> or banks of SLTEs with dedicated cables in submarine cable network <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> to offer provisioning, protection, and restoration. The submarine cable network <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> may exhibit any number of topologies; according to one embodiment of the present invention, the submarine cable network <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is a meshed network that connects a number of telecommunication nodes (in which, for explanatory purposes, only a single node is shown at each end of the submarine cable network <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>). Additionally, in an exemplary embodiment, the switching system <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> provides an electrical switch fabric that switches at STS (Synchronous Transport Signal) (STM &lsqb;Synchronous Transport Module&rsqb;)-N(M) (N&gt;&equals;48, M&gt;&equals;16). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, another embodiment of the present invention supplies an all-optical switch fabric that is transparent to bit rate, protocol, and format of the optical signals on the wavelengths of a DWDM (dense wave division multiplexing) fiber. In such an implementation, SLTEs <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> utilize DWDM equipment, such as a dense wavelength division multiplexer for multiplexing many light wave carriers having different frequencies over the submarine cable network <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. Across the expansive distance of submarine cable network <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, signal amplifying equipment, such as optical amplifiers (not shown) and/or an optical regenerators (not shown) are employed to maintain proper signal strength. SLTEs <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> contain optical transmitters and receivers (not shown) to transport optical signals over the submarine cable network <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. The optical signals may be transported over separate fibers within a single physical optical cable and/or over diverse optical cables. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Submarine cable network <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> connects SLTE <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> to another SLTE <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> (or bank of SLTEs) within Continent B. SLTE <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> couples to switching system <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. At each landing station (node) of the submarine cable network <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, a binary interface (e.g., <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>) between the switching system (e.g., <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>) and SLTE (e.g., <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>) communicates alarm information associated with a network fault. Additionally, a SONET (Synchronous Optical Network) STM-N interface (e.g., <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>) transports STM-N signals to provide alarm information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;binary interface&rdquo; generally refers to a means for communicating alarms and status conditions (such as equipment malfunctions, signal degradations, etc.) directly from one network element to another, as opposed to embedding such information in the overhead of a traffic-bearing signal, such as along SONET STM-N interface <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. A binary interface may provide more immediate and dependable communication of alarm and status information, especially if other robustness measures, such as error-tolerant coding schemes, are applied to the binary interface <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. The binary interface <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> yields a faster response time than the usual embedded interface (in the order of microseconds versus milliseconds, for example). The binary interface <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> sends to the switching system controller; in turn, the switching system controller analyzes the fault and refers to the lookup tables in the database <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> rather than the embedded signal analyzing the fault and sending the message (delayed by the analysis time) to the switching system controller. Since the switching system <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> must perform the root cause analysis anyway (fault conditions), the embedded analysis is a redundant event. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Given the advantages of the binary interface <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, the protect switching or restoration mechanisms of the system <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, according to one embodiment of the present invention, rely primarily upon direct indications from the binary interface <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, although such systems may also respond to signal overhead bytes and communications through a network management system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> According to one embodiment of the present invention, a network management module receives alarm signals from the line terminating equipment and reconfigures the submarine cable network based upon the received alarm signal. At the node within continent A, switching system contains network management interfaces <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> to a network management system <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> (NMS) <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>. Similarly, the node in continent B utilizes network management interfaces <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. In an exemplary embodiment, alarm information is extracted based upon the following priority of sources: the binary interfaces <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>; the STM-N interfaces <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>; and NM interfaces <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. The above priority is based upon the speed, in relative terms, by which the alarm information can be obtain, with the binary interfaces <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> being the fastest and the NM interfaces <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> being the slowest. For instance, if the binary interface <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> or the STM-N interface <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> fail to detect the fault based on pre-determined failure states, then network management (NM) interfaces (e.g., <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>) are relied upon to trigger any necessary restoration procedures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that although NMS <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> is shown as a separate system, in an alternative embodiment, the NMS <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> may be a network management module associated with switching system <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. SLTE <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> also communicates with NMS <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> via a separate NM interface <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>. A similar configuration is used for the node in Continent B; SLTE <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and switching system <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> possess NM interfaces <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> to a NMS <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> NMSs <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> form a logical connection (i.e., controller) network for global management over the submarine cable network <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> to coordinate the reconfiguration of the submarine cable network <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. The switching systems <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> use alarm information from the respective SLTEs <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> to trigger a restoration event based on, for example, lookup state tables with pre-programmed restoration plans. These state tables, in an exemplary embodiment, are stored within databases <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> that are coupled to switching systems <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>, respectively. Databases <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> store look-up tables that trigger pre-determined activities according to the alarms. According to one embodiment of the present invention, the look-up tables specify restoration plans; in addition to or alternatively, the look-up tables trigger activities related to provisioning of services related to the submarine cable network <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The restoration plans that are selected can be optimized based on classes of service of the different signals that were affected. Specifically, these restoration plans can be programmed based on Service Level Agreements (SLAs) as executed between service providers and their customers. For example, the SLA parameters are pre-computed and are prioritized accordingly, such that upon occurrence of a failure, those links corresponding to the higher priority SLAs are restored before the lower priority SLAs. Programmed restoration plans may include 1&plus;1, 1:1, 1:N (N&gt;&equals;2), N:N, N:M, ring, mesh with different restoration times on a combination of submarine, terrestrial and/or festoon geographical networks. An exemplary mesh optical network is further detailed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,038,044 (Fee et al.), entitled &ldquo;Ring/Mesh Optical Network&rdquo;, which is incorporated herein in its entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The NMSs <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> may also provide provision of services by reconfiguring the submarine cable network <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> to accommodate additional capacity requirements of the customers. For example, a service provider associated with the submarine cable network <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> may sell capacity to various customers with a diverse set of requirements. These customer requirements may range from low priority traffic to mission critical data; therefore, the service provider may separately negotiate service level agreements with each of the customers. To effect these SLAs, provisioning data from an operation support system (not shown) of the submarine cable network <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is supplied to the NMS <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>. The provisioning data may include information that specifies the individual capacity requirements of the customers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference> shows a submarine cable network that provides network reconfiguration, according to an embodiment of the present invention, as a result of a cable cut. A switch <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>, which may be optical or electrical, is coupled to SLTEs <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>. SLTE <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> communicates with SLTE <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> via a cable <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight>, which supports multiple channels (i.e., routes). In this example, cable <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight> provides a number of working channels (w<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, w<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, and, w<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>) and a protection channel (p<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>). SLTE <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> terminates at another switch <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>, which may optical or electrical corresponding to switch <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight>. Switch <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> is also coupled to another SLTE <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> which connects to SLTE <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> over a cable <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight>&mdash;which provides working channels (w<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, w<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, and, w<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>) and a protection channel (p<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> As seen in the example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B, a</cross-reference> cable cut occurs on cable <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight>, disrupting communication between SLTE <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> and SLTE <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight>. At this point, the switch <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> is instructed to reroute the traffic that originally was carried by the w<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>route of cable <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight> to the protection route p<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>of cable <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight>. As a consequence of this restoration procedure, the actual SLA for the duration of the restoration operation is different in that the protection route may be pre-empted if a service disruption occurs in the cable <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight> that requires use of the protection route p<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>to support the traffic on the working channels w<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, w<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, and, w<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. Given the above configuration, the submarine cable network can provide rings, mesh, or other types of restoration and protection, using multiple diversely-routed cables (e.g., fibers). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> is a flowchart of the reconfiguration process of the system of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. For the purposes of explanation, it is assumed that submarine cable network <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> experiences a cable cut in one of its links. When this fault occurs, the SLTE <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and SLTE <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> detect the cable cut; each of the SLTEs <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> generates alarm data and notifies the corresponding switching systems <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. The process of fault detection is more fully described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,914,794 (Fee et al.), entitled, &ldquo;Method of and Apparatus for Detecting and Reporting Faults in an All-Optical Communications System,&rdquo; which is incorporated herein in its entirety. The binary interfaces <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> strip the alarm data from the SLTEs <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, as in step <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. However, if the binary interfaces <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> (or the STM-N interfaces <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>) are unable to strip the alarm data, then the switching system <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> forwards the alarm data through NM interface <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> to NMS <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>; likewise, switching system <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> transmits the alarm data to NMS <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> via NM interface <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. In step <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, each of the NMSs <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> processes the received alarm data from the switching systems <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. The NMSs <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> coordinate the resolution of the detected fault over the logical connection network. If the detected fault is verified (per step <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>), then the switching systems <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>, as in step <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>, retrieve the appropriate restoration plans from the restoration databases <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>, respectively. Subsequently, the switching systems <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> implement the pre-programmed restoration plans, per step <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference> shows a flowchart of the process of provisioning services on the submarine cable network.

<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> According to one embodiment, the reconfiguration process is provided by computer system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> in response to processor <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> executing one or more sequences of one or more instructions contained in main memory <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight>. Such instructions may be read into main memory <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> from another computer-readable medium, such as storage device <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>. Execution of the sequences of instructions contained in main memory <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> causes processor <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> to perform the process steps described herein. One or more processors in a multi-processing arrangement may also be employed to execute the sequences of instructions contained in main memory <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight>. In alternative embodiments, hard-wired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions. Thus, embodiments are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Further, the instructions relating to the restoration plans and provisioning may reside on a computer-readable medium. The term &ldquo;computer-readable medium&rdquo; as used herein refers to any medium that participates in providing instructions to processor <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> for execution. Such a medium may take many forms, including but not limited to, non-volatile media, volatile media, and transmission media. Non-volatile media includes, for example, optical or magnetic disks, such as storage device <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>. Volatile media includes dynamic memory, such as main memory <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight>. Transmission media includes coaxial cables, copper wire and fiber optics, including the wires that comprise bus <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>. Transmission media can also take the form of acoustic or light waves, such as those generated during radio wave and infrared data communications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Common forms of computer-readable media include, for example, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic tape, or any other magnetic medium, a CD-ROM, any other optical medium, punch cards, paper tape, any other physical medium with patterns of holes, a RAM, a PROM, and EPROM, a FLASH-EPROM, any other memory chip or cartridge, a carrier wave as described hereinafter, or any other medium from which a computer can read. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Various forms of computer readable media may be involved in carrying one or more sequences of one or more instructions to processor <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> for execution. For example, the instructions may initially be carried on a magnetic disk of a remote computer. The remote computer can load the instructions relating to network restoration remotely into its dynamic memory and send the instructions over a telephone line using a modem. A modem local to computer system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> can receive the data on the telephone line and use an infrared transmitter to convert the data to an infrared signal. An infrared detector coupled to bus <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> can receive the data carried in the infrared signal and place the data on bus <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>. Bus <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> carries the data to main memory <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight>, from which processor <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> retrieves and executes the instructions. The instructions received by main memory <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> may optionally be stored on storage device <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> either before or after execution by processor <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Computer system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> also includes a communication interface <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> coupled to bus <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>. Communication interface <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> provides a two-way data communication coupling to a network link <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> that is connected to a local network <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight>. For example, communication interface <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> may be a network interface card to attach to any packet switched local area network (LAN). As another example, communication interface <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> may be an asymmetrical digital subscriber line (ADSL) card, an integrated services digital network (ISDN) card or a modem to provide a data communication connection to a corresponding type of telephone line. Wireless links may also be implemented. In any such implementation, communication interface <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> sends and receives electrical, electromagnetic and/or optical signals that carry digital data streams representing various types of information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Network link <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> typically provides data communication through one or more networks to other data devices. For example, network link <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> may provide a connection through local network <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> to a host computer <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> or to data equipment operated by a service provider, which provides data communication services through an IP (Internet Protocol) network <highlight><bold>327</bold></highlight> (e.g., the Internet). LAN <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> and IP network <highlight><bold>327</bold></highlight> both use electrical, electromagnetic or optical signals that carry digital data streams. The signals through the various networks and the signals on network link <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> and through communication interface <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight>, which carry the digital data to and from computer system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, are exemplary forms of carrier waves transporting the information. Computer system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> can transmit notifications and receive data, including program code, through the network(s), network link <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> and communication interface <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The techniques described herein provide several advantages over prior approaches to management of a submarine cable network. A network management module is capable of receiving alarm signals from a line terminating equipment and reconfiguring the submarine cable network based upon the received alarm signal. The network management module may also initiate the reconfiguration of the submarine network to accommodate provisioning services. This arrangement advantageously permits a service provider to satisfy service level agreements with the customers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Obviously, numerous modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described herein. </paragraph>
