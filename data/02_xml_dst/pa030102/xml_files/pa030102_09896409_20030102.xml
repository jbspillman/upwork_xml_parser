<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">An electronic assembly includes one or more conductive clamps (<highlight><bold>302, 304, </bold></highlight>FIG. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>), which are used to supply current to an integrated circuit (IC) package (<highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>). The conductive clamps are attached to a printed circuit (PC) board (<highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>), which supplies the current to the IC package over one clamp, and receives returned current from the IC package over another clamp. Each clamp contacts a contact pad (<highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>) on the surface of the PC board, and contacts another contact pad (<highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight>) on the top surface of the IC package. Vias (<highlight><bold>338, 339</bold></highlight>) and conductive planes (<highlight><bold>340, 342</bold></highlight>) within the package then carry current to and from an IC (e.g., IC <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>) connected to the package. In another embodiment, the clamp (<highlight><bold>904, </bold></highlight>FIG. <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>) holds a conductive structure (<highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight>) in place between the PC board contact pad (<highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight>) and the IC package contact pad (<highlight><bold>914</bold></highlight>), and current is carried primarily over the conductive structure, rather than over the clamp. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to apparatus for providing current to an electronic circuit housing, and more particularly to providing high currents to an integrated circuit package through a clamp, and methods of manufacturing a clamp and an electronic assembly, which includes a clamp. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Electronic circuits, and particularly computer and instrumentation circuits, have in recent years become increasingly powerful and fast. As these circuits become faster, and the currents they require also continue to increase. In some cases, integrated circuits (ICs) are requiring currents of up to 100 amps, and future ICs will likely require substantially more current. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Using prior art technologies, current is supplied to the IC&apos;s package through connectors (e.g., pins, solder balls, etc.) located on the bottom surface of the package. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates a cross-section of an electronic assembly in which power is supplied and returned through pins, in accordance with the prior art. The assembly includes IC <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, IC package <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, socket <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, and PC board <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> IC <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> contains one or more circuits, which require current to operate. IC <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is electrically and mechanically connected to the top surface of IC package <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, typically using wire-bond (not shown) or solder connections <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> IC package <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, in turn, is electrically and mechanically coupled to the top surface of socket <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> using bottom connectors, such as pins <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, which mate with complementary pin holes within socket <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, IC package <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> could be coupled to socket <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> using solder connections, such as land grid array (LGA) or ball grid array (BGA) connections, for example. Connectors <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> are used to supply and return current to and from IC package <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and also to carry input/output (I/O) signals to and from the package <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> PC board <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> could be, for example, a motherboard of a computer or other electronic system. As such, it acts as a vehicle to supply power, ground, and I/O signals to integrated circuit <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. These power, ground, and other signals are supplied through traces or planes (not shown) on or within PC board <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, socket <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, connectors <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, and IC package <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Often, a large number of the package&apos;s connectors (e.g., pins <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>) are dedicated to supplying and returning current. For example, a typical package may have 300 of 500 connectors dedicated to current supply and return, leaving only about 200 connectors for I/O signals. The current carrying capacity of the package is limited by the cumulative cross sectional area of the current carrying connectors (e.g., the cross sectional area of the current carrying pins). If the current becomes too high, some or all of the current carrying connectors may permanently fail, resulting in a partial or full loss of IC functionality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> One prior art solution to the need for more power is to increase the number of connectors dedicated to power delivery. However, this solution further limits the number of connectors that can be dedicated to I/O signals. In order to provide more connectors for power and/or I/O signals, the connector count must be increased, thus increasing the package size. Package size increases typically are undesirable in most applications, because larger packages reduce IC device speeds due to increased inductance, and because of the consumer-driven trend within industry is to reduce the size of electronic systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In some cases, power is supplied to a package from a power pod, through an edge connector of an interposer (i.e., a substrate that provides a dimensional interface between connectors on a package and connectors on a socket or printed circuit board) upon which the package is mounted. A power pod is an additional power supply that typically supplies power to one device within a system, as opposed to supplying power to the entire system. That power is transmitted from the interposer to the package through the package&apos;s bottom connectors. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates a cross-section of an electronic assembly in which power is supplied and returned through a power pod connector <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, in accordance with the prior art. The assembly illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is similar to the assembly illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, except that the IC package <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is electrically and mechanically connected to an interposer <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, which in turn connects to a socket <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> mounted on PC board <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The power pod connector <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> can be a clamp with conductive surfaces <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> on the insides of two opposing jaws <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. When engaged with the interposer <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, the conductive surface <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> on one jaw makes contact with a conductive plane <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> on the top surface of the interposer <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, while the conductive surface <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> on the opposing jaw makes contact with another conductive plane <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> on the bottom surface of the interposer <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. One conductive plane supplies current, while the other conductive plane returns current. This current travels from the conductive planes through vias and conductive layers within interposer <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, to the package&apos;s connectors <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Although higher currents can be supplied using a power pod, the current must still travel from the interposer through the package&apos;s connectors <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. Thus, the supplied current is relatively far from the IC, and the amount of current supplied to the package <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is still limited by the cumulative cross sectional area of those connectors (e.g., pins <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>), which are dedicated to power delivery. In addition, the conductive surfaces of a typical power pod connector do not connect to the interposer&apos;s conductive planes with a high normal force. Accordingly, a non-negligible contact resistance is associated with the power pod, resulting in the power pod connector consuming a certain portion of the supplied power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> As the power requirements for ICs continue to increase, there is a need for power delivery apparatus that can supply higher currents than are possible using prior art technologies. In addition, what is needed is a power delivery apparatus that enables more package connectors to be dedicated to I/O signals, rather than to power supply and return, without increasing the package size. Further needed is a power delivery apparatus that supplies current closer to the IC and with a lower contact resistance than is possible using prior art, power pod connector solutions.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The various embodiments of the invention can be used to supply higher currents to a housing (e.g., a printed circuit board, interposer or electronic circuit package) than is possible using prior art technologies. In addition, the various embodiments enable more connectors on the bottom surface of the housing to be dedicated to purposes (e.g., I/O signals) other than power delivery without increasing housing size. Also, the various embodiments enable current to be supplied closer to an integrated circuit, resulting in reduced inductance and lower contact resistance than is possible using prior art, power pod solutions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Various embodiments of the present invention provide a clamp, which attaches to a substrate and contacts a portion of the top surface of a housing. In one embodiment, the clamp includes a contact plate, which attaches to the substrate, a spring arm, which extends in an upward direction from the substrate, and a contact flange, which compresses against the top surface of the housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The clamp is electrically conductive, in one embodiment, and current flows from a conductive pad on the substrate, through the clamp, to a conductive pad on the housing, or vice versa. In another embodiment, the clamp is used to compress one end of a conductive structure against a conductive pad on the substrate, and compress another end of the conductive structure against a conductive pad on the housing, where the current is carried substantially through the conductive structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Further provided is an electronic assembly, which includes one or more clamps as described above. In one embodiment, two such clamps are included, where one clamp is used to supply current to a housing, and the other clamp is used to return the current from the housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates a cross-section of an electronic assembly in which power is supplied and returned through clamps <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The assembly includes clamps <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, integrated circuit (IC) <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, IC package <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, socket <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, PC board <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, and stiffening plate <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. Starting from the top of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, IC <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> is housed by IC package <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>. IC <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> contains one or more circuits, which are electrically connected to conductive structures within IC package <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> through connectors, such as ball grid array connectors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> IC <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> could be any of a number of types of integrated circuits. In one embodiment of the present invention, IC <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> is a microprocessor. In other embodiments, IC <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> could be a memory device, application specific integrated circuit, digital signal processor, or another type of device. In the example shown, IC <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> is a &ldquo;flip chip&rdquo; type of integrated circuit, meaning that the input/output terminations on the chip can occur at any point on its surface. After the chip has been readied for attachment to IC package <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, it is flipped over and attached, via solder bumps or balls to matching pads on the top surface of IC package <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, IC <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> could be wire bonded to IC package <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, where I/O and power terminations are connected to IC package <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> using bond wires to pads on the top surface of IC package <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, or otherwise connected to package <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> IC package <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> is electrically coupled to socket <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> through connectors. In the configuration shown, IC package <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> includes pins <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>, which mate with complementary pin holes in socket <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. In other embodiments, IC package <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> is electrically coupled to socket <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> using ball grid or land grid array connections. In still other embodiments, IC package <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> is electrically coupled to an interposer (not shown), which in turn connects to a socket through pinned or soldered connections. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Socket <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> connects to PC board <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> using soldered or pinned connections. In one embodiment, a stiffening plate <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> is attached to PC board <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> in order to provide increased mechanical stability to PC board <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. In another embodiment, no stiffening plate is used to provide such stability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> PC board <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> could be, for example, a motherboard of a computer or other electronic system. PC board <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> acts as a vehicle to supply I/O signals to IC <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the I/O signals are supplied through traces or planes and other conductive structures on or within PC board <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, socket <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, and IC package <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>. For ease of illustration, most of the conductive structures associated with I/O signals are not depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In addition, PC board <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> supplies and returns power to one or more of the circuits within IC <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. Some or all of this power is supplied and/or returned, in one embodiment of the present invention, through one or more clamps <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, which are attached to PC board <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> and which contact the top surface <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> of IC package <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>. By supplying and/or returning some or all of the power through clamps <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, more of the IC package&apos;s pins <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> (or other bottom surface connectors) can be dedicated to I/O signals, rather than to power and ground. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, each clamp <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is formed from one or more conductive materials, and includes a contact plate <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, a spring arm <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>, and a contact flange <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>. Contact plate <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is attached to a contact pad <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> on the top surface of PC board <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> using one or more fasteners <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>, in one embodiment. In various embodiments, fasteners <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> could be threaded fasteners (e.g., screws), rivets, clips or other types of fasteners.

In some cases, the loop area may cause the power delivery system to have undesirable inductance characteristics. In one embodiment, a first clamp (e.g., clamp <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>) is used for current delivery and a second, adjacent clamp (e.g., clamp <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>) is used for current return, where an adjacent clamp is defined as a clamp that is next to the first clamp. This configuration enables the area of the power delivery loop to be decreased, along with the inductance characteristic of the power delivery system. In various embodiments, multiple clamps could be used for either or both current delivery and return. For example, clamps <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> could be used for current delivery, and clamps <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> could be used for current return. Alternatively, adjacent clamps <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> could be used for current delivery, and adjacent clamps <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> could be used for current return. </paragraph>

In one embodiment, the clamp includes contact plate <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>, spring arm <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>, and contact flange <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight>. Contact plate <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>, spring arm <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>, and contact flange <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> could be integrally formed together, or they could be connected using various rigid connections (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, contact plate <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> includes one or more fastener openings <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight>, through which one or more fasteners (e.g., fasteners <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) can be installed to attach contact plate <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> to a PC board (e.g., PC board <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) or other substrate. Openings <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> are illustrated as circular in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. In other embodiments, openings <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> could have other shapes, and/or could be located in different areas of contact plate <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>. For example, a fastener opening <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> could be a notch at an edge of contact plate <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>, which would facilitate attachment of a clip or other type of fastener. In addition, although two fastener openings <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> are illustrated, contact plate <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> could include more or fewer fastener openings. Alternatively, if contact plate <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> is attached to a substrate using solder, adhesive, or some other means of attachment, fastener openings <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> may not be present on contact plate <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Spring arm <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> is designed, in one embodiment, to provide a high normal force between the clamp and a contact pad on a housing, when the clamp is attached to a substrate. Spring arm <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> includes first arm member <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>, curved member <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight>, and second arm member <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight>, in one embodiment. First arm member <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> extends from contact plate <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> in a first direction. When the clamp is attached to a substrate, the first direction is a direction upward from the substrate and away from the housing, in one embodiment. Curved member <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> attaches first arm member <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> and second arm member <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight>. Second arm member <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight> extends from curved member <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> in a second direction. When the clamp is attached to a substrate, the second direction is a direction toward the housing and the contact flange <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In an alternate embodiment, the spring arm could have a different configuration. For example, the spring arm could include a single arm member that is curved or substantially straight. When the clamp is attached to a substrate, the single arm member would extend from the contact plate in a direction toward the housing. Alternatively, the spring arm could have more than two arm members. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The cross sectional area of the clamp, and particularly the spring arm <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>, should be large enough to conduct a current within a range of 100-250 amps without failure, in one embodiment. This cross sectional area is defined by the width <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> and the thickness <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight> of the clamp. In other embodiments, the cross sectional area could be designed to withstand currents that are higher or lower than the above range without failure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Contact flange <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> is attached to spring arm <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>, and includes a bottom surface <highlight><bold>624</bold></highlight> and an upwardly curving portion <highlight><bold>626</bold></highlight>, in one embodiment. The bottom surface <highlight><bold>624</bold></highlight> makes contact with a contact pad on the housing, when the clamp is attached to the substrate. The upwardly curving portion <highlight><bold>626</bold></highlight> facilitates the contact of the bottom surface <highlight><bold>624</bold></highlight> of flange <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> with the contact pad during the attachment process. Essentially, while the clamp is being attached, the bottom surface of the upwardly curving portion compresses and scrubs against the contact pad, resulting in an increase in the contact surface area and a reduction in the contact resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, contact plate <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>, spring arm <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>, and contact flange <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> are integrally formed a conductive bulk material such as, for example, copper, brass, steel or combinations of these or other conductive metals, alloys or other materials. Desirably, the conductive bulk material is capable of conducting large amounts of current without failure, and has a sufficient spring coefficient both to provide a high normal force on the housing contact pad and to avoid breaking when the clamp is attached to a substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The conductive bulk material is coated, in one embodiment, with a conductive coating material such as, for example, gold, platinum or combinations of these or other conductive metals, alloys or other materials. Desirably, the conductive coating material is resistant to corrosion and provides a low contact resistance when the clamp is attached to a substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates a cross-section of a portion of an electronic assembly prior to clamp attachment, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> illustrates a cross-section of a portion of an electronic assembly after clamp attachment, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, before clamp <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> is attached to substrate <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>, the spring arm <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> is neither extended nor compressed, and a gap <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> exists between the contact plate <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> and the substrate <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>, in one embodiment. Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, after clamp <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> is attached to substrate <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>, the spring arm <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> is extended, causing contact flange <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> to compress and scrub against contact pad <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> on the top surface of housing <highlight><bold>806</bold></highlight>. By extending spring arm <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight>, contact flange <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> exerts a high normal force in a downward direction against contact pad <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight>, which results in a low contact resistance between clamp <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> and contact pad <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight>. In addition, the high normal force further compresses housing <highlight><bold>806</bold></highlight> into socket <highlight><bold>808</bold></highlight>, thus facilitating the electrical connection of the housing&apos;s bottom connectors (e.g., pins <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight>) and the socket connectors. In another embodiment, where the housing and socket are a land grid array housing and socket, this high normal force facilitates the electrical connection between opposing contacts and may improve performance of the assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The description, above, focuses on supplying and returning current through conductive clamps. Thus, the length of the current path from the power supply to the IC includes the length of the clamp&apos;s spring arm. In some cases, the length of the current path, when supplied through the conductive clamps, may result in undesirable inductance characteristics for the power supply system. In an alternate embodiment, these inductance characteristics can be reduced by providing a conductive structure, which is held in place by one or more clamps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> illustrates a cross-section of a portion of an electronic circuit assembly in which power is supplied and returned through a conductive structure <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight>, which is held in place by a clamp <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>, in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, clamp <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> may be, but is not necessarily, formed from a conductive material, but its primary function is not to carry current. Instead, its primary function is to compress and hold a first end <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> of the conductive structure <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> in contact with a contact pad <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight> on the surface of substrate <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight>, and to compress and hold a second end <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight> of the conductive structure <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> in contact with a contact pad <highlight><bold>914</bold></highlight> on the top surface of housing <highlight><bold>916</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, current is primarily carried between the housing <highlight><bold>916</bold></highlight> and the substrate <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight> through the conductive structure <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight>. Because the length of conductive structure <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> can be made shorter than the length of the spring arm of clamp <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>, the inductance associated with conductive structure <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> can be made less than the inductance associated with clamp <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, conductive structure <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> is formed from a flexible structure that includes multiple conductive paths that are electrically isolated from one another. For example, conductive structure <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> could be a ribbon cable. In such an embodiment, a first set of the conductive paths can be used to supply the current to the housing, and a second set of the conductive paths can be used to return the current from the housing. In such an embodiment, the supply and return current paths can be, but are not necessarily, made adjacent one another, thus further reducing the inductance characteristics of the power delivery system. In another embodiment, conductive structure <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> could be made only to supply or return current, but not both. In still another embodiment, conductive structure <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> could include only a single conductive path. In still another embodiment, conductive structure <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> is formed from a rigid material. </paragraph>

In one embodiment, the top surface of the housing includes multiple conductive contact pads <highlight><bold>1012</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1014</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1016</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1018</bold></highlight>, each of which connects to one or more vias (not shown) and one or more conductive planes (not shown) within housing, as described previously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, each of the multiple conductive paths <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight> is held in contact with a conductive pad <highlight><bold>1012</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1018</bold></highlight> by clamp <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight>. In other embodiments, more than one conductive path could be held in contact with each conductive pad, or a single conductive path could be held in contact with multiple conductive pads. Although the pads <highlight><bold>1012</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1018</bold></highlight> and the ends of conductive paths <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight> are shown to extend beyond clamp <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight> for ease of illustration, the pads and/or conductive path ends could also be positioned underneath clamp <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, adjacent conductive paths alternate between being dedicated to current supply and current return. Thus, for example, conductive paths <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1008</bold></highlight> could be dedicated to current supply, and conductive paths <highlight><bold>1006</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight> could be dedicated to current return. In alternate embodiments, all of the conductive paths <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight> could be dedicated either to current supply or current return, but not both. Alternatively, the conductive paths dedicated to current supply and to current return might not strictly alternate. Although <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> illustrates only two clamps and eight conductive paths, additional clamps and conductive paths could be used along the same housing edge or adjacent housing edges, in various embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> illustrates a flowchart of a method for manufacturing an electronic assembly having clamps, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.

In one embodiment, the clamp is formed by punching a pattern from a flat piece of conductive bulk material, bending the pattern to form the spring arm and the contact flange, and coating the contact plate, spring arm, and contact flange with a conductive coating material. In another embodiment, the clamp is not coated with a conductive material. In still another embodiment, the clamp is formed using a nonconductive material (e.g., in an embodiment that uses a separate conductive structure to conduct current, such as structure <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>). </paragraph>

In one embodiment, the clamp is conductive, the contact plate is attached to a contact pad on the substrate&apos;s surface, and the contact flange compresses directly against a contact pad on the housing&apos;s surface. In this embodiment, current can be carried between the substrate and the housing over the clamp.
