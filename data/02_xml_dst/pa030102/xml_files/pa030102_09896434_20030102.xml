<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Traditional portable electronics/electrical devices such as electrical tools or toys draw power from the batteries installed inside the devices. The number of batteries required depends on the working voltage specified by the circuit utilized. For many electronics circuits, three batteries are needed to provide a typical working voltage between 3V to 4.5V. The working voltage required by many microcontroller chips are in between 3V to 6V. In order to provide a reasonable working battery life to a device drawing a current over 100 mA, such as the products that comprise a light bulb, motor or speaker, the size of the batteries selected are typically of AA, C or D size batteries. These batteries not only add considerable weight to the device, it limits the ability of the designer to shrink the product size. It is the objective of this invention to provide a cordless system that does not required bulky batteries to be built inside a hand held article of sales. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention is firstly directed to a hand held article of sales having an electrical circuit. This electrical circuit may include an electricity to light transducer such as light bulb or LED. It may comprise a motor to provide motion output. Alternatively, it may also include a speaker to generate sound, music or voice messages. The circuitry may also include other different kinds of applications circuits such as a design to identify itself from other articles of the same family. The first characteristics of this hand held article is that there is no battery installed inside the body of the article. Accordingly the size, weight and cost of the article are reduced. At least two conductive contact terminals are provided on two different locations of the article, preferably at the two sides, suitable to be held by the index finger and the thumb of a human hand. When electrical power is fed through these conductive contact terminals, the internal electrical circuit is activated. In order to feed power to this hand held article, a separated controller compartment having mating contact terminals connecting to a power source and/or appropriate interfacing circuits are provided. In a preferred embodiment, these contact terminals are specially designed for attaching to the fingers of an user&apos;s hand, such as the thumb and the index finger. Alternately, a structure is provided enabling the motion of the index finger and a thumb to position two contact terminals of the controller to the target article. When the user picks up the article, the mating contact terminals located at the fingers touch the conductive contact terminals of the article. Accordingly power is provided to the electrical circuit of the article through the finger contact action. When the electrical circuit of the article is powered and activated, it may generate responses such as light, motion or sound according to the nature of the electrical circuit built inside the article. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The finger contact terminals are wired to the compartment that provides the power source required. This compartment can be attached to the hand, the wrist, the arm, the waist, attached to any other location of the human body or kept inside a pocket. A velcro tape is preferred for fast attachment of the compartment to the human body. The actual power source may also be represented by one or more energy storage device, such as batteries, or a wall mounted adapter. For a louder sound to be generated, the small speaker installed at the miniature size article can be replaced by a larger speaker and relocated to the power supply compartment. In this case, the audio signal may be either obtained from a circuit built inside the article, then amplified in the controller compartment to drive the larger speaker. Alternately the electrical circuit embedded inside the target article may send a trigger signal to the sound chip located inside the controller compartment for driving the speaker. If three pairs of finger contact terminals are provided to bridge between the article and the control compartment, the audio signal and the battery connection circuit may share a common wire. If only two pairs of contact terminals are provided, the AC audio signal may be superimposed onto the DC power supply line, for the circuit to share the two conducting wires. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In the application when the audio signal is provided by the control circuit located inside the controller compartment, the electrical circuit located inside the target article provides an identity or a triggering signal to the control circuit through the finger contacts. Accordingly, different sounds may be generated from the compartment control circuit according to which external article is picked up by the finger contacts. In addition to sound, other supporting circuits such as a display panel, LEDs and/or control buttons can be added to the compartment to provide additional features for enriching the product package. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The wires connecting in between the finger contacts and the compartment are preferably to be flexible, or adjustable to suit for different hand sizes. The finger contact terminals can be designed to be part of a ring, a finger cap, or a glove for attaching to the tips of a finger. In order to avoid accidental short circuiting the power source when the two finger contact terminals are touching each other, a short circuit sensor, and/or other protection circuit such as analog to digital (A/D) feed back circuit, a current limiter, a fuse or a high current shut down circuit can be provided to prevent any short circuit hazard. Alternately, a finger tip contact terminal can be structured only for touching the contact terminals of the target articles but not the adjacent finger tip contact terminal. For example, each finger tip contact terminal can be protected by a protruded non-conductive wall so that two finger tip contact terminals are not allowed to touch each other. However, the mating conductive contacts on the article side can be formed to provide a smaller protruded shape so that they are free to be contacted by the finger contact terminals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Preferably a family of different target articles having similar contact designs are to be provided to enrich the value of the package. A first preferred embodiment of the article is a miniature flashlight having a light bulb or a LED connected to two contact terminals located at the opposite sides of the flash light. When the fingers pick up the flashlight, electricity is provided from the battery compartment, conducted through the contact terminals for lighting up the light bulb or the LED. A modification of the concept is to provide a light bulb or LED inside a flying object such as a dart, a ball, or any other projectile object. An energy storage device such as a miniature battery or a capacitor can be built inside this projectile object to continuously light up the LED after the flying object left the hand of the user. The energy storage device will continue to light up the light bulb or LED for a short period of time after external power is discontinued. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Other embodiments of the article include different toy articles, such as dolls, action figures, toy characters, toy size wheeled vehicles, airplane, helicopter, or toy size electrical hand tool. A motor is included in many of these toy articles to provide motion response when the target article is picked up. It should be noted that although many toy articles such as the wheeled vehicles should be miniature reproductions of the life size products, the application of the invention on electrical tools can be extended to regular life size tools. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In the case the target article is a member of a toy family, such as dolls, wheeled vehicles or action figures, an identifying circuit can be built inside the toy to differentiate one member of the family from another. When the toy is picked up, the interface and/or controller circuit inside the compartment read the identifying signal from the toy. The nature of the toy is then identified by a detection circuit. Different voices, visual displays, motions or interactive responses tailor designed for that particular toy member may be generated. A simple way of embedding an identifying circuit inside the toy is to provide a specified valued electrical component such as a resistor or a capacitor. When the toy is in contact with the user&apos;s fingers, the value of the resistor or capacitor is measured by the interfacing circuit and/or the controller located inside the controller compartment. Different component values, each represents a different toy, directs the controller to provide different voice or interactive responses. Typical interfacing circuit capable of identifying a resistor value such as A/D converter, comparator circuit or bridge circuit are applicable to serve this application. Allowing all the different toys to share the same power source located at the controller compartment is another distinctive benefit of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A further enhancement of the invention is to provide a toy for the children to explore the electrical characteristics of different external objects, or materials. In a preferred embodiment, the resistance of the object contacted by the fingers are evaluated and responses are provided by voice, light or a message displayed on a visual area, such as a LCD panel. When a very low resistance is detected, the response can be: &ldquo;This is a metal&rdquo;. When a very high resistance is read, the response is &ldquo;This is not conductive.&rdquo; When a medium resistance is read, the unit response: &ldquo;Is it a human skin&quest;&rdquo;. When low to medium resistance is detected, the response may be &ldquo;It feels wet&quest;&rdquo;. Alternately, a tone can be generated and the frequency or volume of the tone can vary according to the resistance or capacitance detected by the two finger contact terminals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> This figure tip exploring device can also be configured to become a battery tester. When the finger contact terminals are placed across a battery, the controller and interface circuit inside the compartment detects an external voltage. The initial voltage is first read. The battery voltage is then connected to a predefined load and the loaded voltage is read again. The comparison between a no load voltage and a loaded voltage will indirectly reflects the strength of the battery under test. The result can be announced by voice, or visually represented by a meter, LED indicator or LCD display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The novel features of the invention are set forth with particularity in the appended claims. The invention will best be understood from the following description, when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Attention is initially directed to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> which depicts the combined application of a controller embodiment <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and an article of sale embodiment <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> in accordance with the invention. The controller <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> comprises a compartment <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, a velcro tape <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> to attach the compartment <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to a human hand; two finger caps <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> for attaching to the thumb <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> and the index finger <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. On each of the finger cap is a conductive contact terminal <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. Each contact terminal is connected to the compartment <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> by conducting wires <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The conductive wire <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> has a flexible; elastic or coiled segment <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> for adjusting the distance between the finger cap <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and the compartment <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. Alternately, the exposed length of the wire <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> can be adjusted by hiding some segment of the wire inside the compartment <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. Inside the compartment <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> are batteries that provide power to the external target article, the toy car <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. Two contact terminals <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> are positioned at the two sides of the toy car <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> such that when the car is picked up by the fingers <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, each contact terminal <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> make contact with the corresponding contact terminal <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> of the car and provide power to the electrical circuit inside the car. A motor linked to the wheels of the car is provided inside the car. The terminals of this motor are connected to the contact terminals <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. As soon as the finger contact terminals <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> touches the contact terminals <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, the motor is powered by the batteries inside the compartment and starts to run. Alternately an electricity to light transducer such as LED is included inside the car. The LED will be lit when the car is picked up. In an alternate embodiment the electrical circuit located inside the car is an identifying circuit which provide some electrical identification characteristics, the electrical circuit inside the compartment picks up the identification through the finger contacts and response with some sound effect appropriate with the characteristics of the target article, the car <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. For example, when an ambulance is picked up, a siren sound is generated. If an ice-cream retail van is touched by the fingers <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, a music box type of melody is played. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Attention is now directed to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> which illustrates another controller unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. On top of the compartment <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is a LCD display panel <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, a speaker area <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> and input buttons <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. Two segments of mounting tape <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> extends from the opposite sides of the compartment are provided for attaching the controller compartment to the hand of an user. Mating velcro segments at the ends of the tape <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> enable the compartment to be fitted with hands of different sizes. It should be noted that other than the hand, the compartment can be stored or attached to other many different parts of the human body. The controller compartment is linked with the contact terminals <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> by the conducting wires <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>. At the end of the conducting wire <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> is a plug <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> which is configured to be plugged into the socket <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> for conducting electricity between the compartment and the finger tip contact terminals <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. More than one receiving locations of the plug <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> are possible for adjusting the exposed dimension of the wire <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates an embodiment of the electrical circuit included inside the compartment <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The compartment provides a power source represented by the batteries <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> connected to different power points <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> of the circuit. When the microcontroller <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> sinks current through the resistors <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, the transistor <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> is turned on and an electrical current is fed to the external target article through the contact terminals <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>. Contact terminals <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> are represented by the contact terminals <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The amount of current provided to the target article is controlled by the amount of base current fed through the control resistors <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>. These resistor may also works as a D/A (digital to analog) converter to translate digital signals provided by the microcontroller into an analog signal for feeding the external target article. Resistor <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> limits the amount of the current flowing through the contact terminals <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> in case of excessive current drawn. The control buttons <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> are represented by the switches <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Reset switch <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> is provided to reset the microcontroller <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> when required. The circuit also provides a LCD display unit <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> that is represented by the display panel <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In a different preferred embodiment, the controller <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is configured to become a battery tester. When the finger tip contact terminals <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> are in contact with the terminals of a battery, this voltage is converted into digital readings by the A/D (analog to digital) converter <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> and then read by the microcontroller <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. The diode <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> protects the circuit when the battery polarities are inverted. The microcontroller may also turn on the transistors <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> to provide an artificial load to the external battery. The battery voltages at different loading conditions are analyzed and accordingly the power capacity of the battery is indicated on the display panel <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> or announced by the speaker <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the external target article comprises of different members of a family of toys, each having an unique identifying circuit embedded inside the toy. When this identifying circuit, such as resistors of different unique values, is in contact with the contact terminals <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>, the A/D circuit <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> reads the value of the resistor. With a predefined resistance look up table built inside the software program, the microcontroller is able to identify the specific toy article picked up by the fingers <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Accordingly different voice message or interactive responses custom designed to the target article can be produced. Alternately, different custom designed visual messages can be displayed on the LCD panel <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In another further application, the external target article comprises an embedded voice chip. When the target article is powered up by the DC electrical current supplied by the transistor <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight>, an AC voice message can be generated and fed back to the contact terminals <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>. This AC voice message is filtered by the capacitor <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight>, amplified by the amplifier <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> and drives the speaker <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight>. In real world application, the two speaker driving circuits should be combined to save cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Attention is now drawn to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> illustrating a preferred embodiment of an electrical circuit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> included inside the body of a target article. This circuit is able to generate digital signals when power is received. The digital signal can be used for signaling the identification of the target article or serve other applications. The contact terminals <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight> represents the conductive terminals positioned outside the target article, such as the contact terminal <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> of the toy car <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The heart of the circuitry is a microcontroller <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>. The microcontroller is powered by the external voltage obtained from terminals <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight>. The capacitor <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> is included as a filter and also a power reservoir to store electrical energy when the contact terminals are momentarily out of contact. When power is connected to the contact terminals <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight>, the microcontroller is powered up. At this moment, the voltage waveform across the terminals <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight> is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference>. Once the electrical circuit is stabilized, the microcontroller <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> generates a series of pulses <highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> according to the nature of the target article. These pulses turns the transistor <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> ON and OFF and accordingly giving a pulsing loading to the power line through the resistor <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. The amplitude of the pulses <highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> are determined by the value of the resistor <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> and the internal impedance of the interfacing facing circuit at the controller end. The pulses <highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> are then processed by the electrical circuit at the controller end. Responses are generated according to the pulses detected. The diode <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> is included to attenuate the pulsing signal to enter the power supply line <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> of the microcontroller circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In order to determine when the microcontroller <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> should generate pulses and what kind of pulses can be generated, a trigger switch <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> is included in the circuit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. In many applications, the target article is accessed by only two fingers, which also provide the contact function to power up the chip. Therefore the switch <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> is preferably be integrally positioned right behind the contact terminal <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight>, so that the switch <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> can be triggered by the same finger accessing the contact terminal <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight>. Likewise, a controller switch is preferred to be linked to the mechanism of the controller side contact terminals such that this switch can be triggered by the same thumb and index finger controlling the movement of the controller side contact terminals. Another advantage of this design is that the electrical circuit can be set to a low power standby mode to conserve energy. The circuit is revoked to the normal operation mode only when this controller switch is triggered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</cross-reference> illustrates another generic circuit applicable for the target article. The block <highlight><bold>434</bold></highlight> represents the loading circuit of the target article. It can be an analog circuit, a digital circuit or a programmable circuit. It can also be a simple loading circuit such as a motor, a light bulb or a LED. Triggering is provided by pushing the switch <highlight><bold>433</bold></highlight> which connect the capacitor <highlight><bold>435</bold></highlight> to the power line of the circuit. The capacitor <highlight><bold>433</bold></highlight> will provide a momentary negatively going triggering pulse <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference>. This trigger pulse will be useful to trigger the electrical circuit located at the controller end. The resistor <highlight><bold>436</bold></highlight> is included for discharging the capacitor <highlight><bold>435</bold></highlight> when the trigger switch <highlight><bold>433</bold></highlight> is released. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> is a design alternative of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A, wherein the functional block <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> generates an analog signal such as a voice waveform. This voice waveform is amplified by the transistor <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> and coupled to the contact terminal <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> by the capacitor <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight>. The DC voltage measured across the terminals <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>509</bold></highlight> are represented by the voltage waveform <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference>. The coupled AC signal is represented by the analog waveform <highlight><bold>521</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> An alternative preferred embodiment is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference> having a glove <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> and a controller compartment <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>. The controller compartment <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> is identical in nature to the controller compartment <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The mounting tapes <highlight><bold>611</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> are structured to mount the controller compartment to the wrist or the arm of the user.

In case of an electric tool application, the controller compartment package <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> can be replaced by a simple battery box or the wall mounted adapter <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</cross-reference>. The plug <highlight><bold>623</bold></highlight> is simply connected to the socket <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> of the glove <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> to provide electricity to any electric tool picked up by the fingers <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Attention is now drawn to another preferred embodiment of the target article, the dart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference>. The body <highlight><bold>717</bold></highlight> of the dart is made of a transparent or translucent material. Embedded inside the dart is a light emitting transducer <highlight><bold>716</bold></highlight> and an optional energy storage reservoir <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight>. At the two sides of the body are the conductive contact terminals <highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> for conducting power to the internal circuit of the dart. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference> illustrates an embodiment of the circuit inside the dart. The light emitting transducer <highlight><bold>716</bold></highlight> is represented by the LED <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight>. The energy reservoir <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight> is represented by the capacitor <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight>. The resistor <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight> defines the intensity of the LED. The charging current of the capacitor <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight> is limited by the resistor <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>. The LED <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> is lit when finger contact provides electrical power to the contact terminals <highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight>. The capacitor <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight> is also fully charge up when the electrical power is maintained for one to two seconds. When the dart leaves the hand of the user, the LED continuously to be lit until the electrical power stored inside the capacitor <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight> is used up. This design provides a beautiful tail light along the projectile of the dart.
