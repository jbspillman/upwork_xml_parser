<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention generally relates to memory technology and more specifically relates to sense amplifiers in FLASH memory devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Most memory technology employs sense amplifiers. These sense amplifiers are typically designed for low current inputs with high gain and rapid response times. However, memory technology also often involves selecting a particular cell and letting that cell pull a node down or up, to a different value from what the node is biased to when no cell is selected. That node is typically the input node of the sense amplifier. As a result, the fastest sense amplifier is of little use if the input node can only be pulled to a different voltage slowly by the memory cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> One method for providing a memory cell that can rapidly pull a node up or down is to use a large transistor in the memory cell, thus allowing for high current which may pull the node to the desired voltage. However, the larger the transistor, the more space the memory cell requires, and therefore the lower the density of memory cells can be on a given memory chip. Furthermore, a larger transistor may have increased capacitive coupling effects which will lead to a slower transition from a non-conductive to a conductive state, resulting in a property of the larger transistor defeating the purpose of having the larger transistor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Beyond problems with how quickly a node may be pulled down or up, problems may arise when comparing a reference cell and memory cell response due to settling time on the inputs to the sense amplifier. If the reference cell has a greater effect on the reference input node initially than the memory cell has on the sense input node, then the sense amplifier may generate a signal which is false early in the cycle, before the sense input node transitions properly. This means that the delay associated with the sense amplifier may be longer than would otherwise be expected or preferable. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> A method and apparatus for sen-ref equalization is described. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the invention can be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Reference in the specification to &ldquo;one embodiment&rdquo; or &ldquo;an embodiment&rdquo; means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the invention. The appearances of the phrase &ldquo;in one embodiment&rdquo; in various places in the specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. Likewise, alternative or separate embodiments are not necessarily mutually exclusive of other embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The low voltage sensing in FLASH memories is carried out through use of a common mode current mirror (current source) and kicker circuitry in the sensing circuitry. The common mode current mirror provides current generally sufficient to satisfy the current drain from the bias network, and the kicker circuitry provides additional pullup current (charge) relative to the current supplied by the column load in the sensing circuitry. By providing both of these additional elements, the column load may be sized and designed as a more resistive load suitable for providing a significant voltage swing between a high and a low voltage on a FLASH cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The voltage swing between the high and the low voltage on the FLASH cell is sensed by the actual sense amplifier, and amplifiers generally perform better with increased voltage differentials on the inputs of the amplifier. In a FLASH design, the sense amplifier may sense the difference between a reference FLASH cell and a FLASH cell to be sensed. The voltage swing has an effect on the difference between the voltages produced by the relatively stable reference FLASH cell and the FLASH cell to be sensed. The voltage produced by the FLASH cell to be sensed may differ more from the voltage produced by the reference FLASH cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> As will be appreciated, transient or bias differences between the sense and reference inputs of the sense amplifier can prolong the time needed to achieve a stable output from the sense amplifier. Additionally, settling time on the inputs of the sense amplifier can similarly prolong the time needed to achieve a stable output on the sense amplifier. As such, equalizing the inputs prior to allowing the FLASH cell to be sensed and the reference FLASH cell can be useful to reduce the time needed to achieve the desired stable output on the sense amplifier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Note that the invention is described with reference to embodiments incorporating FLASH cells which are known to those skilled in the art. However, it will be appreciated that other forms of persistent memory storage locations (such as EPROM cells for example) may be utilized in conjunction with the invention without exceeding the spirit and scope of the invention. A persistent memory storage location, such as a FLASH cell, typically may be programmed to store a &lsquo;one&rsquo; or a &lsquo;zero&rsquo; which represents a binary digit or bit. The actual &lsquo;one&rsquo; or &lsquo;zero&rsquo; as stored in the persistent memory storage location may be stored as a charge level or some other measurable property of the persistent memory storage location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is an embodiment of sensing circuitry for a FLASH cell array. Sense input <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is coupled to a FLASH cell to be sensed (not shown). Ref input <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is coupled to a FLASH reference cell (also not shown). Equalize signal <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is coupled to a first or gate node of a transistor <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>. Transistor <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> has a second node coupled to sense input <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and a third node coupled to ref input <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Thus, equalize signal <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may be used to control whether sense input <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is coupled to ref input <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, thereby allowing for equalization between sense input <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and ref input <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> First and second drain bias networks <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> are each coupled to sense input <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and ref input <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> respectively, and each network <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is controlled by a common drain bias enable input <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. The first drain bias network <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> produces a SIN signal <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> which represents an input to the sense amplifier <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> corresponding to the sense input <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The second drain bias network <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> produces a RIN signal <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> which represents an input to the sense amplifier <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> corresponding to the ref input <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The drain bias networks <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> operate to make the output of a FLASH cell to be sensed (or a reference FLASH cell) into an output suitable for use as an input to a differential amplifier such as sense amplifier <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, a FLASH cell output can be measured as a current, and the drain bias network operates to convert this current to a voltage for sensing purposes. Note, however, that this conversion does not change anything other than the manner of sensing of the value of the FLASH cell. Sense amplifier <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> compares the two inputs to produce a sense amplifier output <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> By equalizing the sense input <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the ref input <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, the corresponding inputs to the sense amplifier <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> may be expected to rise and fall relatively closely. In particular, if the sense input <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the ref input <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> are equalized until the FLASH cell to be sensed and the reference FLASH cell are coupled thereto, one can expect that this equalization will tend to minimize changes in polarity of the voltage difference between the sense input <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the ref input <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> during the time for sensing those inputs. This implies that the sense amplifier <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> will not change its output <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> once it determines the polarity of the differential between the two inputs. This in turn leads to a faster stable output signal <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> from the sense amplifier <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Turning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, an alternative embodiment of sensing circuitry and a FLASH cell is illustrated. FLASH cell <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is made up of a floating gate NMOS transistor <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> coupled to ground at its first node and to a first node of column select NMOS transistor <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> at transistor <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>&apos;s second node. Note that in most MOSFET transistors, a first or second node may be either a source or drain of the transistor, while in bipolar junction transistors the first or second node may be either a collector or emitter. Column select signal <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is coupled to the gate of transistor <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>. The second node of transistor <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> is coupled to the gate of transistor <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> and to the first node of transistor <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. The first node of transistor <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> is coupled to ground, and the second node of transistor <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> is coupled to the gate of transistor <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, the gate of transistor <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, and the first node of transistor <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight>. The second node of transistor <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> is coupled to the first node of transistor <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> and to the first node of transistor <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight>, and the node at which this coupling is made is referred to as SINA <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight>. The gate and the second node of transistor <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight> are both coupled to a power supply such as Vcc. Likewise, the gate and the second node of transistor <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> and the gate and the second node of transistor <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> are coupled to a power supply. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Also coupled to the node SINA <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> is the second node of transistor <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> and the first input of sense amplifier <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>. Coupled to the first node of transistor <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> and the first node of transistor <highlight><bold>243</bold></highlight> is a power supply. Coupled to the gate of transistor <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> and the gate of transistor <highlight><bold>243</bold></highlight> is current adjust input <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. Coupled to the first node of transistor <highlight><bold>243</bold></highlight> is node SINB <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight>. Node <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> is also coupled to the second input of sense amplifier <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>, the first node of transistor <highlight><bold>249</bold></highlight>, the first node of transistor <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>, and the second node of transistor <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight>. The output of sense amplifier <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> is coupled to data <highlight><bold>237</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The second node and gate of transistor <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> are coupled to a power supply, as is the second node of transistor <highlight><bold>249</bold></highlight>. The gate of transistor <highlight><bold>249</bold></highlight> is coupled to the gate of transistor <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight>, the first node of transistor <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> and the second node of transistor <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight>. The first node of transistor <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> is coupled to the gate of transistor <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> and to the second node of transistor <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight>. The gate and the second node of transistor <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> are coupled to a power supply. The first node of transistor <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> is coupled to ground. The first node of transistor <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> is coupled to the second node of floating gate transistor <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight>. The first node of floating gate transistor <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight> is coupled to ground. Reference cell <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> is formed by floating gate transistor <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight>, which is preferably programmed to serve as a reference voltage similar to that of a FLASH cell in either a programmed or erased configuration. Alternatively, reference cell <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> may be programmed to serve as a reference voltage nearly midway between a &lsquo;programmed&rsquo; and an &lsquo;erased&rsquo; voltage of a FLASH cell, thereby supplying a trip voltage to sense amplifier <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in this embodiment, transistor <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> may be adjusted to provide current sufficient to satisfy most of the demand from transistor <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. As a result, transistor <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> may be implemented as the column load for cell <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. Similarly, transistor <highlight><bold>243</bold></highlight> may provide current sufficient to satisfy most of the demand from transistor <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight>, thus allowing transistor <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> to act as a column load for reference cell <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Equalization transistor <highlight><bold>275</bold></highlight> has a first node coupled to the first node of transistor <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>, a second node coupled to the first node of transistor <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight>, and a third node coupled to equalize signal <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, equalize signal <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> causes equalization transistor <highlight><bold>275</bold></highlight> to conduct until transistors <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> couple the cells (<highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>), thereby equalizing the inputs to the sense amplifier <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> prior to changes induced by the cells (<highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>) to be sensed. Also note that the exact connection of transistor <highlight><bold>275</bold></highlight> to other elements in the circuit is not necessarily crucial, so long as it can operate to equalize the inputs to the sense amplifier and thereby settle both the inputs and the corresponding output. Here, transistor <highlight><bold>275</bold></highlight> is connected to circuit elements near the inputs of the drain bias circuitry, but that need not be the only useful location within the circuit. Furthermore, layout positioning of transistor <highlight><bold>275</bold></highlight> may or may not be critical, depending on many other factors affecting circuit design as understood by those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, transistors <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>243</bold></highlight> provide common mode current necessary to run or power the drain bias circuitry. Transistors <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> provide the column load associated with the drain bias circuitry, and may be sized to achieve a highly resistive (and therefore sensitive) load to the cells <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>. Transistors <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> provide a kicker which speeds up the stabilization of SINA <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> in response to a change at the first node of transistor <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, such as coupling of the cell <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. Similarly, transistors <highlight><bold>249</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> provide a kicker which speeds up the stabilization of SINR <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> in response to a change at the first node of transistor <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight>, such as coupling of the cell <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>. Transistors <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> thus make up a first drain bias circuit, and transistors <highlight><bold>243</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>249</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> make up a second drain bias circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is another alternative embodiment of sensing/biasing circuitry for use with a FLASH cell. SHREF signal <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> is suitable for coupling to a reference FLASH cell. SHSEN signal <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is suitable for coupling to a FLASH cell to be sensed. Equal transistor <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> is coupled at a first node to the node of SHREF <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, at a second node to the node of SHSEN <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and at a third node to the equalize signal <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. Two drain bias networks <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> are provided, one coupled to SHREF <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and another coupled to SHSEN <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Each drain bias network <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> has a control input set <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> associated therewith, allowing for tuning of the drain bias networks. In one embodiment, the control input set <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> of the first drain bias network <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> is coupled to the same signals that are coupled to the control input set <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> of the second drain bias network <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>, thereby assuring nearly identical operation of the circuits. Furthermore, the control input sets <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> may be used as enable inputs. One drain bias network <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> produces an output RIN <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> which is produced from the SHREF signal <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and which is suitable for coupling to the reference input of a sense amplifier. The other drain bias network <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> produces an output SIN <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> which is produced from the SHSEN signal <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and which is suitable for coupling to the sense input of a sense amplifier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Turning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A, an illustration of a simulation of sensing a FLASH cell programmed to a &lsquo;one&rsquo; without an equalization pulse is provided. Note that the equalization pulse <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> is illustrated, for ease of comparison with simulations utilizing the equalization pulse. The drain bias enable signal <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> is illustrated as high (enabled in one embodiment). Furthermore, the sense amplifier out signal <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> is illustrated as high, since the inputs do not perturb the sense amplifier enough to cause the output to swing low. The RIN <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> and SIN <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> signals may be seen to rise and to cross each other several times. These signals are the inputs to the sense amplifier, and the time it takes for them to stabilize leads to the time necessary to achieve a stable output from the sense amplifier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Turning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>B, an illustration of a simulation of sensing a FLASH cell programmed to a &lsquo;one&rsquo; with an equalization pulse is provided. Note that in this simulation, the two signals RIN <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> and SIN <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> move in near lockstep due to the coupling of the equalization circuit, thus eliminating the crossover behavior seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>. While the instability of the sense amplifier output <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> may be seen here, it is apparent that after the second dip on the output, the output may be expected to be stable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Turning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>C, an illustration of a simulation of sensing a FLASH cell programmed to a &lsquo;zero&rsquo; with an equalization pulse is provided. Again, in this simulation, the two inputs RIN <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> and SIN <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> move in tandem during the equalization period, with only slight differences, and then separate in a monotonic manner with respect to the differential. No crossover behavior is illustrated. Turning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>D, an illustration of a simulation of sensing a FLASH cell programmed to a &lsquo;zero&rsquo; without an equalization pulse is provided. In this simulation, the crossover behavior of the SIN <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> and RIN <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> signals is repeated several times, causing a long delay before the sense amplifier output <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> is at a stable, useful value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates an embodiment of a FLASH integrated circuit. Addressing circuitry <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> receives address signals (not shown) and translates those signals into column select <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> and row select <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight> (each of which may be implemented as a bus of individual signals in one embodiment). FLASH cell array <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> receives column select <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> and row select <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight>, and the combination of the two results in selection of a single FLASH cell from the array <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> in one embodiment. FLASH cell array <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> may also receive a data input <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight> which is suitable for programming a selected cell. FLASH cell array supplies a signal (voltage/current) to comparison circuitry <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>, and the supplied signal is derived from or comes directly from the selected cell. Comparison circuitry receives the signal supplied by FLASH cell array <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>, and compares that signal to a reference signal. The comparison results in a data output signal <highlight><bold>580</bold></highlight> which is generated by comparison circuitry <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>. Power and bias circuitry <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> is coupled to each of the other portions of the FLASH integrated circuit, and may supply power and bias voltages and currents. Circuitry <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> may also supply such signals as programming and erase signals as appropriate, and may embody a charge pump for producing voltages greater than a supply voltage of the FLASH integrated circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Turning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, an embodiment of the method of operation of low voltage sensing in flash memories is illustrated. It will be appreciated that the blocks in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> are depicted in serial fashion but may actually be implemented in a parallel or simultaneous fashion. In block <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>, the FLASH cell is selected, such as by selecting an appropriate column select signal and thereby connecting a FLASH cell to the sensing apparatus. At block <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight>, an equalization pulse is begun, causing the inputs used for the FLASH cell to be sensed and the reference FLASH cell to be coupled together and to move substantially together along a V-I curve (a plot of voltage versus current). At block <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight>, the FLASH cell is loaded by the sensing apparatus, such that the FLASH cell will conduct current from the load to ground if it is programmed in a state to conduct. At block <highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight>, current is supplied from the load to the FLASH cell. At block <highlight><bold>650</bold></highlight>, the equalization pulse is ended, allowing the sense inputs for the reference FLASH cell and FLASH cell to be sensed to decouple. At block <highlight><bold>660</bold></highlight>, the difference in voltage between the connected FLASH cell and a reference FLASH cell is measured, as by a sense amplifier. It will be appreciated that the measurement is a comparison between a voltage level produced by a reference FLASH cell and a voltage level produced by the selected FLASH cell in one embodiment which may involve measurement of both voltage levels. Furthermore, it will be appreciated that loading the FLASH cell (or the reference FLASH cell) may also include supplying current to the FLASH cell (or reference FLASH cell). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> By using a column load in conjunction with a current mirror, the measured difference in voltage may be detected relatively easily, as the voltage swing that occurs when the column load reacts to a change in current may be fairly high. Furthermore, by using the equalization pulse, the two inputs may be kept equal during what would normally be a transient condition subject to short-term variations in performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In the foregoing detailed description, the method and apparatus of the present invention has been described with reference to-specific exemplary embodiments thereof. It will, however, be evident that various modifications and changes may be made thereto without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the present invention. In particular, the advantages conferred by the kicker and the common mode current source may be viewed as separate and cumulative, such that neither is necessarily required in a circuit to derive the advantages conferred by the other. Furthermore, it will be appreciated that a device may be coupled to another device in a direct or an indirect manner, such that the transistor <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> may be said to be coupled both to transistor <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> and to FLASH cell <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. Moreover, with respect to flow diagrams and processes, it will be appreciated that a flow diagram organized in a linear or stepwise fashion may represent operations which may be reorganized to occur in a different order, or to occur in a parallel fashion for example. The present specification and figures are accordingly to be regarded as illustrative rather than restrictive. </paragraph>
