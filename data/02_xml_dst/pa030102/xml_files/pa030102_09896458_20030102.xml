<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to multi-layer gratings/mirrors and their application in analyzing systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Discussion of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It is well known in the art to use large d-spacing artificially grown crystals, e.g. PET crystals, for x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy. Such artificial crystals are very sensitive to the environment and degrade quickly under the influence of radiation, heat, moisture, etc. Accordingly, the artificial crystals do not last long and are difficult to use. In hard x-rays region (wavelength less than 0.2 nm) ordinary crystals, e.g. Si or Ge crystals, when used in monochromators and spectrometers in some cases have resolving powers that are too high (&tilde;104) and cut out too much useful flux. Accordingly, the measurement times become longer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> While reflective gratings can be used in place of the artificial crystals, such gratings suffer from low diffraction efficiency in the softer x-ray region (wavelengths ranging from about 0.2 nm to about 1.2 nm). Multilayer mirrors, while improving reflection efficiency relative to the gratings in a wide wavelengths range (from 1 nm to 20 nm), have a resolving power that is too low &tilde;&lgr;/&Dgr;&lgr;&tilde;10&minus;100. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Multilayer gratings/mirrors are well known in the art and are very stable, durable and are easy in use. Examples of such multilayer gratings/mirrors are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,727,000; 5,646,976 and 5,757,882, the entire contents of each are hereby incorporated herein by reference. It is well known that the bandpass of such multilayer gratings/mirrors is defined by the number of bilayers in which the incident wave penetrates. This number of bilayers in the multilayer grating/mirror is limited by the factor that due to interference in, the periodical structure of the multiple layers stacked upon one another, the radiation wave incident on the multilayer grating/mirror is reflected back and does not penetrate any deeper than a so-called extinction depth. The extinction depth is determined by the wavelength of the incident radiation and the materials of the multilayer grating/mirror. The bandpass and correspondingly the resolution of a spectrometer or a monochromator that uses a multilayer grating/mirror is proportional to: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>&Dgr;&lgr;/&lgr;&tilde;1/<highlight><italic>N, </italic></highlight></in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> wherein N is the number of multilayer periods present within the extinction depth. In many instances, the resolution of a spectrometer or a monochromator is required to be better than that as determined by the extinction depth in the manner described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Based on the above relationship, one way to increase the resolution of a multilayer grating/mirror is to increase the extinction depth and thus the number N of multilayer periods within the extinction depth. One known way to increase the extinction depth is to etch grooves in the multilayer grating/mirror and remove part of the reflection planes so as to allow the incidence radiation wave to penetrate deeper into the multilayer grating. As a result, the number of layer N in the extinction depth increases and the bandpass, or the resolution, increases in accordance with equation (1) above. Such a multilayer grating/mirror is discussed in the paper entitled &ldquo;Lamellar Multilayer Gratings with Very High Diffraction Efficiency,&rdquo; V. V. Martynov et al., SPIE Vol. 3150 0277-786X/97, pp. 2-8. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> By changing the groove/period ratio of the multilayer grating/mirror, the amount of removed material can be continuously varied and, thus, the extinction depth and resolution can be continuously varied. The maximum practical factor in the bandpass variation is defined by technological limits and, for different wavelength, can be as from 1 to 100. While such a multilayer grating/mirror provides increased resolution, the multilayer grating/mirror with periodically spaced lands also generates many diffraction orders, which contribute in making the detector signal to have a small signal to noise ratio. The generation of multiple diffraction orders is shown by analogy to the single layer periodic transmission grating diffraction intensity distribution shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Obviously, if a single layer transmission grating with a periodic structure generates multiple diffraction orders, then a multi-layer transmission grating with a periodic structure will also generate multiple diffraction orders. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is an objective of the present invention to provide a multilayer grating/mirror that for a wide range of wavelengths has increased resolution and diffraction efficiency while at the same time contributing in making the detector signal having a large signal to noise ratio. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide crystals that are not sensitive to the environment and do not degrade quickly when used in an analyzing system. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an x-ray fluoroscopy analyzing system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a radiation generator or source, such as x-ray tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, that generates a beam of radiation along a first direction, such as a beam of x-rays <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The x-rays <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> have a wavelength that ranges from 0.3 -1.0 nm. The x-rays <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> generated from x-ray tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are received by and interact with the object or sample <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> so that x-ray fluorescence radiation <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is generated from the object <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The x-rays <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are directed through a slit <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and received by a multilayer grating/mirror <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which reflects only a zeroth order of diffraction of x-rays <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of a particular wavelength, such as 0.71 nm. The x-rays <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are then received by a detector system <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, such as a proportional counter detector. The detected radiation is then analyzed in a well known manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the multilayer grating/mirror <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes a multilayer structure <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> deposited on a substrate <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The multilayer structure <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is made out of alternating layers of materials with large and small atomic numbers. The material with large atomic number can be selected from the materials W, Ni, Fe, Mo, V, Cr and the material with small atomic numbers can be selected from the materials C, Si, B4C. For example, the multilayer structure <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> can be made out of alternating layers of W (10 &angst;) and C (10 &angst;) layers. Thus, the period, d, of the alternating W and C layers is 20 &angst;. In this embodiment, the number of periods, d, of alternating W/C bi-layers in the multilayer structure <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is 500. Note that the number of bi-layer depends on a spectral resolution/bandpass requirements. For 500 bi-layers, the bandpass &lgr;/&Dgr;&lgr;&tilde;N &tilde;500. The period of the multilayer depends on a required Bragg angle and typically ranges from 15A to 100A for different wavelengths. In addition, other materials and thicknesses for the layers of materials with large and small atomic numbers are possible depending on the specific needs for wavelength and Bragg angle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> plurality of grooves <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are formed randomly on the multilayer grating/mirror <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The grooves <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are positioned between lands <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the multilayer structure <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, wherein each land <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> has a width of approximately 1 micron and contains 500 periods of alternating W/Si bilayers. The starting points or positions xi of the lands <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can be determined by a formula given below: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>xi</italic></highlight>&equals;(<highlight><italic>d*i</italic></highlight>)&plus;&lsqb;<highlight><italic>ki*</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>d&minus;Wland</italic></highlight>)&rsqb;,&emsp;&emsp;(2) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> where d&equals;effective period of the grating/mirror <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, i&equals;1, 2, 3, . . . ; Wland&equals;width of land and ki&equals;a random number from 0 to 1. Note that the widths of the lands and depths of the grooves are constant for the entire area of the grating. Furthermore, the lands are placed randomly inside each period according to the formula (2) above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> One of the benefits of using a multilayer grating/mirror <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with a random pattern of grooves is that all diffraction orders, except the zeroth order, are suppressed. In other words, only the direct beam is reflected by the grating/mirror <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The suppression of diffraction orders is shown by analogy to the single layer random structure transmission grating diffraction intensity distribution shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Obviously, if a single layer transmission grating with a random structure suppresses multiple diffraction orders, then a multi-layer transmission grating with a random structure will also suppress multiple diffraction orders. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In the above-described mode of randomizing the grating/mirror <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the land widths and the grooves depths are selected so that a desired width of the peak of the rocking curve of the grating/mirror <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which is the same as an energy bandpass or spectral resolution of the grating/mirror <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, is achieved. Thus, the ability to change the bandpass allows the spectral resolution to be adjusted to specific requirements and so as to optimize flux and resolution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> While the above description constitutes the preferred embodiments of the present invention, it will be appreciated that the invention is susceptible of modification, variation and change without departing from the proper scope and fair meaning of the accompanying claims. For example, the grating <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can also be used as a monochromator. </paragraph>
