<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A tool for driving and setting a nail-in anchor into concrete. The tool has a drive pin which can be locked and unlocked. When the drive pin is locked, the tool, used with a hammer, will drive only the anchor sleeve into a pre-drilled hole in concrete. When the drive pin is then unlocked, the tool, again used with a hammer, will nail the nail into the sleeve and set the anchor. The tool can be manipulated using only one hand. The tool typically has a thumb cap which, when rotated, locks and unlocks the drive pin. The tip of the tool is machined to have a concave shape for fitting over the convex-shaped dome of a typical nail-in anchor. The outer surfaces of the tool can have knurls to improve handling. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a setting tool for a nail-in anchor. The tool is used to drive the anchor sleeve into a pre-drilled hole; then the same tool is easily rotated for nailing in the nail and setting the anchor. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Concrete nail-in anchors are widely used in the construction industry. A nail-in anchor has an anchor sleeve topped by a convex-shaped crown or dome. A nail is inserted into the sleeve through a hole in the dome. A hole is drilled in the concrete or brickwork. The anchor sleeve is inserted through a mounting hole in a structural piece (or through an opening in an angle iron bracket, etc.) and hammered into the hole in the concrete. Finally, the nail is driven into the sleeve, forming a wedge and setting the anchor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Presently, the tools used for driving and setting a nail-in anchor can be inefficient and even ineffective. Typically, a series of tools must be utilized. A drill is used to make the hole in the concrete. A hammer and/or screwdriver is used to hammer the anchor sleeve into the hole so that the dome rests on the surface of the concrete. A driving tool, such as a screwdriver, chisel, or center punch, and a hammer are then used to drive in the nail and set the anchor. The tools presently used can be difficult to align in order to hammer the anchor sleeve into the hole and may damage the dome of the anchor, which is often made from soft metal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Having to then switch a different tool for driving the nail requires re-alignment, wasting time and causing the installer to lose his focus. When dozens of anchors must be set, the expenditure of time can be substantial. When used to drive in the nail, the presently-available tools may cause the nail to bend to one side and can even cause the nail head to chip off. Anchors may not be properly set, resulting in a poor result, both structurally and cosmetically. In hard-to-reach places, the installer using presently-available tools has little room to hammer in an anchor; in such circumstances, the anchor is likely to fail. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a setting tool for nail-in anchors which overcomes the problems of the prior art. The tool is designed so that novices can use it. The tool is safe and comfortable to use. It eliminates the need to switch from one tool to another, thereby saving time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The installer grips the body of the tool with one hand. The tool of the present invention has a concave milled end which fits over the dome of an anchor sleeve. The outer surfaces of the tool are knurled, to improve handling. In its locked position, the pin, or shaft, of the tool cannot move. Using a hammer or mallet held in his other hand, the installer strikes the exposed end of the locked pin, and the body of the tool drives the anchor until its dome rests against the surface of the material in which it is to be anchored. Without changing the position of the tool, using his thumb, the installer rotates the latch cap in a counter-clockwise direction, unlocking the pin of the tool so that it can move freely up and down within the body of the tool. When the exposed end of the unlocked pin is then struck with a hammer, the tool will drive in the nail and set the anchor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The tool can be used without damaging the anchors and the surface of the object being anchored. The installer is able to stay completely focused on installing each anchor. Finally, Installation of each anchor takes considerably less time than does the process using presently-available tools. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide a tool which is safe and comfortable to use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide a tool which is easy to use, regardless of an installer&apos;s experience. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Still another object of the present invention is to provide a tool which allows the installer to install nail-in anchors using focused, efficient movements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a tool which shortens the amount of time required to install each anchor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> A further object of the present invention is to provide a tool with two positions, the first position for driving in the body of an anchor, and the second position for driving in and setting the nail of the anchor; changing from the first position to the second position can accomplished without realigning the tool. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> A still further object of the present invention is to provide a tool which can be used without damaging either the anchors or the surfaces of the material to be anchored.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the nail-in anchor setting tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention is used with a mallet <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to drive a nail-in anchor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> through a hole <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in an angle iron bracket <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and into a drilled hole in a concrete block <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>; the anchor setting tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is then used to set the nail-in anchor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in the concrete block <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, thereby attaching the angle iron bracket <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> firmly against the surface of the concrete block <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> shows the assembled nail-in anchor setting tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which serves as the hand grip, is made from a corrosion-resistant, hard metal such as aluminum. It has a knurled surface to prevent slippage of the tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has a narrow tip <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> which can be used in tight areas, such as the one hole conduit strap, widely used in the electrical industry. The tip <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is machined to have a concave end <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, which fits over the convex portion of the nail-in anchor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Because of the design, use of the tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will not damage the convex-shaped dome of the nail-in anchor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The latch cap <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> (also called a thumb cap), is also made from a corrosion-resistant, hard metal such as aluminum, and has a knurled surface. The drive pin <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, protruding through the top of the latch cap <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, is made from heat-treated steel. The drive pin <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is machined to slide into the bore of the body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and through the tip <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> until its end is even with the concave end <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference> shows a typical nail-in anchor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> for use with concrete or masonry. Such anchors come in different sizes, and include metallics, curries, dotties and zamacs. Typically, each nail-in anchor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has an anchor sleeve <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> with chamfered ends <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> separated by a longitudinal slot <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. Atop the anchor sleeve <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is a convex-shaped dome <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> with a circular groove <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> around a central opening for entry of the nail <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The circular groove <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is shaped to accommodate the head <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the nail <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, so that it is flush with the top of the convex-shaped dome <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> after installation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows the parts of the tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> prior to assembly. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the upper end <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of the body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is pressed into the bore of the lower end <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the latch <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, which is made from heat-treated steel. Alternatively, the surface of the upper end <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of the body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has threads, and the bore of the lower end <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the latch <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> has complementary threads, so the upper end <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of the body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be threaded into the bore of the lower end <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the latch <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. The latch <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> has an O-ring <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, made from a material such as Buna-N with a Durometer such as <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>, which is pressed into an O-ring groove <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B and 3C</cross-reference>). The latch <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is machined to have two notches <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> spaced 180&deg; apart and to have a longitudinal slot <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> through both sides of the latch <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> A dowel pin <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, made from tool steel, has been pressed or floated into a pre-drilled hole <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> in the drive pin <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The dowel pin <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> allows the drive pin <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to lock or unlock from the latch <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. The drive pin <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is inserted into the bore of the body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. When the tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is going to be used, the ends of the dowel pin <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> will rest against the notches <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> on the latch <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> (the drive pin&apos;s <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> locked position), and the installer will use the body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to drive the anchor sleeve <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> into place. The installer will then rotate the latch cap <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, which will rotate the drive pin <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, thereby aligning the dowel pin <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> with the slot <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> on the latch <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> (the drive pin&apos;s <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> unlocked position). The installer will then use the drive pin <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to drive in the nail <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (the dowel pin <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> will slide down into the slot <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> as the nail <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is driven in). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> When the tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is assembled, the ends of the dowel pin <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> fit into complementary dowel pin grooves <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in the bore <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of the latch cap <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, which is slid over the latch <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. With the ends of the dowel pin <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> in the slot <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, the latch cap <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is moved downward, and the end of the drive pin <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> fitted through the hole <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in the top <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> of the latch cap <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. The latch cap <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is then pressed further downward until the O-ring <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> on the latch <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> engages the receiving groove <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> on the bore <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of the latch cap <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, locking the tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> together in its final assembled position. After the tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is assembled, rotation of the latch cap <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> will rotate the latch <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> as well. </paragraph>
