<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates in general to the field of television systems, and more particularly, to a user interface for accessing bi-directional services in television systems. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Historically, television services have been comprised of analog broadcast audio and video signals. Cable television systems now receive broadcasts and retransmit them with other programming to users over land-line networks, typically comprising fiber optic cable and/or coaxial cable. With the recent advent of digital transmission technology, cable television systems are now capable of providing much more than the traditional analog broadcast video. In addition, two-way and advanced one-way communications between a subscriber and a cable system headend are now possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In implementing enhanced programming, the home communication terminal (&ldquo;HCT&rdquo;), otherwise known as the set top box, has become an important computing device for accessing video services and navigating a subscriber through a maze of available services. In addition to supporting traditional analog broadcast video functionality, digital HCTs (or &ldquo;DHCTs&rdquo;) now also support an increasing number of services which are not analog, but rather digital; are not basic broadcast, but rather two-way communication such as video-on-demand; and are not basic video, such as e-mail or web browsers. These are all in addition to the host of other television services which are increasingly being demanded by consumers, examples of which include audio and audio/visual programming, advanced navigation controls, impulse pay-per-view technology, and on-line commerce. With the addition of interactive services and the increased bandwidth and the emergence of bi-directional communication capabilities available through a digital television system, there is a need to provide a subscriber new channels and/or services with dedicated bi-directional communication over an allocated period of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Each HCT or DHCT (collectively hereinafter &ldquo;DHCT&rdquo;) is typically connected to a cable or satellite television network. The DHCTs generally include hardware and software necessary to provide the functionality for services rendered by the digital television system at the client&apos;s site. Preferably, some of the software executed by a DHCT is downloaded and/or updated via the cable television network. Each DHCT typically includes a processor, communication components and memory, and is connected to one or more audiovisual output devices such a television or other display device or a personal computer. Furthermore, a DHCT is typically connected to input devices such as an infrared wireless remote control or a wired or wireless keyboard and can be connected optionally to an audiovisual input device such as a camcorder with an integrated microphone or to a video camera and a separate microphone. While many conventional DHCTs are stand-alone devices that are externally connected to a television, a DHCT and/or its functionality may be integrated into a television or personal computer, as will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Because hundreds or thousands of services may be offered by a cable television service provider, an electronic program guide (EPG) is necessary to facilitate searching for programs, accessing of program information and marketing of purchasable services such as Pay-Per-View (PPV). However, EPGs are provisioned for traditional broadcast services and not for a new breed of services based on bi-directional audio and/or visual communication that can be offered on an individualized basis to a subscriber. Furthermore, the scope of system resource consumption for bi-directional audiovisual services differs from traditional broadcast services and from recent interactive services, such as video-on-demand, that don&apos;t require bi-directional audiovisual communication. Therefore, there is a need for the DHCT to not only provide the services and applications that the cable television system provider offers, but also to provide access to bi-directional communication services and respective service information via an EPG. As system operators of cable television systems continue to add services and applications, a problem exists in both making the subscriber aware of and also in providing quick access to the new services and channels. Because of the large number of subscribers in a cable television network, the large number of bi-directional communication services offered, the fact that each service may be distinct and individually rendered, a problem exists in providing a subscriber a quick and efficient method to access these services. Further, there is a need to provide respective program or service information as well as the ability to search service availability and obtain service information. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The present invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which preferred embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Many modifications and other embodiments of the invention will come to mind to one skilled in the art to which this invention pertains having the benefit of the teachings presented in the foregoing descriptions and the associated drawings. Therefore, it is to be understood that the invention is not to be limited to the specific embodiments disclosed and that modifications and other embodiments are intended to be included within the scope of the appended claims. Although specific terms are employed herein, they are used in a generic and descriptive sense only and not for purposes of limitation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The present invention is generally implemented as part of a cable television system (CTS). Hence, an illustrative CTS <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and its operation will be described initially. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a block diagram view of a CTS <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, which is generally a reliable and integrated network system that features video, audio, voice and data services to subscribers or DHCT users. Although <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> depicts a high level view of a CTS <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, it should be appreciated that a plurality of cable television systems can tie together a plurality of regional networks into an integrated global network so that DHCT users can receive content or services from anywhere in the world. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The CTS <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> delivers broadcast video signals as digitally formatted signals in addition to delivering traditional broadcast analog video signals. Furthermore, the system can support one-way broadcast services as well as both one-way data services and two-way media and data services. The two-way operation of the network allows for user interactivity with services, such as Pay-Per-View programming, Near Video-On-Demand (NVOD) programming (according to any of several known NVOD implementation methods), Video-on-Demand (VOD) programming (according to any of several known VOD implementation methods), and interactive applications, such as Internet connections and interactive services that render real-time bi-directional communication on a personalized basis such as bi-directional audio-visual communication. The CTS <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also provides the interfaces, network control, transport control, session control, and servers to access content and services, and distributes content and services to DHCT users. The CTS <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also provides the interfaces, network control, transport control, session control, and servers to establish on-demand session-based bi-directional communication service between a particular remote destination and a DHCT user for delivering media from the particular remote destination to the DHCT user and input information from the DHCT user to the particular remote destination. A remote destination during a session of a bi-directional communication service may comprise a remote personal destination such as a friend or a remote vendor that offers a bi-directional communication service for a purchasable period of time in which a viewer communicates real-time with the vendor on a personal basis. In either case, dedicated CTS resources are allocated to fulfill individualized bi-directional communication over a purchasable period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> typical CTS <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, hubs <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a hybrid fiber-coax (HFC) network <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, and users&apos; DHCTs <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (hereinafter the terms &ldquo;user&rdquo; and &ldquo;subscriber&rdquo; are used interchangeably). It should be appreciated that although a single component (e.g., a headend) is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> CTS <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may feature a plurality of any one of the illustrated components or may be configured with alternative embodiments for any one of the individual components or with yet other additional components not enumerated above. A content provider (not shown) transmits information pertaining to purchasable bi-directional communication services to a headend for further downstream transmission to subscribers in the network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> A bi-directional communication type of service purchasable as an individualized service by a DHCT user may be provided by one or more service providers via communication with one or more external communication interfaces in headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Content provided by a content provider is retrieved and communicated by a cable operator or communicated by the content provider to one or more headends <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. From those headends the content is then communicated over a communications network <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> that includes a plurality of HFC access networks <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> (only one HFC access network <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is illustrated). The HFC access network <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> typically comprises a plurality of HFC nodes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, each of which may serve a local geographical area. The hub <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> connects to the HFC node <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> through a fiber portion of the HFC access network <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The HFC node <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is connected to a tap <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> that is connected to a network interface unit (NIU) <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, which is connected to a DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The NIU <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is normally located at a user&apos;s property and provides a transparent interface between the HFC node <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the users&apos; internal wiring. Coaxial cables are typically used to couple nodes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, taps <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and NIUs <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> because the electrical signals can be easily repeated with radio frequency (RF) amplifiers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> As the high-level operations of many of the functions of CTSs <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are well known to those of skill in the art, further description of the overall CTS <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> will not be contained herein. It will be appreciated, however, that the CTS <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is merely illustrative and should not be construed as implying any limitations upon the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows the transmission channels supported by the CTS <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, as delivered by the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and received as input channels by the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Although one DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and one headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are illustrated, it is understood by those skilled in the art that more than one of each may be included in a subscriber network television system. As indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the subscriber network television system can simultaneously support a number of transport channel types and modulation formats. The ability to carry analog and digital signals over a large bandwidth are characteristics of a hybrid fiber-coax network typically employed in a subscriber network television system. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, analog and digital signals in HFC networks can be multiplexed using frequency division multiplexing (FDM), which enables many different types of signals to be transmitted over the subscriber network television system to the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the preferred embodiment of the present invention. Typically, a subscriber network television system using HFC supports downstream (i.e. in the direction from the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>) frequencies from 50 MHz to 870 MHz, whereas upstream frequencies (i.e. in the direction from the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to higher levels of the system) are in the 5 MHz to 42 MHz band. Generally, the RF channel bandwidth spacing for analog and digital services is 6 MHz. It should be understood that RF channels can be assigned to carry analog video signals but the present embodiment of the invention is not limited to embodiments where an RF channel is assigned to carry analog video signals upon fulfillment of a complete transition of the subscriber network television system to an all digital system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the downstream direction channels, having been multiplexed using frequency division multiplexing (FDM), and often referred to as in band channels, include Analog Transmission Channels (ATCs) <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and Digital Transmission Channels (DTCs) <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. These channels carry video, audio, and data services. For a non-limiting example, these channels can carry television signals, Internet data, or any additional types of data, such as bi-directional services program guide (BSPG) data. The signals and data carried on these channels are collectively referred to herein as services. The ATCs <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> are typically broadcast in 6 MHz channels having an analog broadcast composed of analog video and analog audio, and include Broadcast TV Systems Committee (BTSC) stereo and Secondary Audio Program (SAP) audio. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Like the ATCs <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, the DTCs <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> each occupy 6 MHz of the RF spectrum. However, the DTCs <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> are digital channels consisting of 64- or 256-Quadrature Amplitude Modulated (QAM) digital signals formatted as MPEG-2 transport streams, allocated in a separate frequency range. The MPEG-2 transport stream enables transmission of a plurality of DTC channel types over each 6 MHz RF channel, as compared to a 6 MHz ATC <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. Three types of digital transport channels <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> include broadcast digital transmission channels <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, carousel digital transmission channels <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, and on-demand transmission channels <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. MPEG-2 transport may be used to multiplex video, audio, and data in each of these digital transmission channels (DTCs) <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. However, because MPEG-2 transport streams multiplex video, audio, and data to be placed in the same stream, the DTCs <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> do not necessarily have to be allocated in separate 6 MHz RF frequencies, unlike the ATCs <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Continuing with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the broadcast DTCs <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and carousel DTCs <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> typically function as continuous feeds for indefinite time, whereas the on demand DTCs <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> are continuous feed sessions for a limited time. All DTCs <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> are capable of being transmitted at high data rates. The broadcast DTCs <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> carry typical data comprising multiple digitally compressed and formatted, for a non-limiting example, as MPEG-2, TV channels and other continuously fed data information. The carousel DTCs <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> carry broadcast data, such as BSPG data and regular electronic program guide (EPG) data, that is systematically broadcast in a cycling fashion but updated and revised as need be. Thus, the carousel DTCs <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> can serve to carry high volume data, such as EPG data and BSPG data, as well as other data at high data rates. The carousel DTCs <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> typically carry data formatted in directories and files by a Broadcast File System (BFS), which is used for producing and transmitting data streams throughout the CTS <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and which provides an efficient method for delivery of application executables and data and service data to the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The on-demand DTCs <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> can carry information intended for a particular subscriber, such as compressed video and audio pertaining to subscriber requested a bi-directional communication service, as well as other specialized data information. Each carousel and on demand DTC <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is defined by a session managed by the session manager <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) via the MPEG-2&apos;s Digital Storage Media&mdash;Command and Control (DSM-CC) protocol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a block diagram of portions of a headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> that is configured to provide session-based services such as bi-directional communication services and a BSPG comprising electronic information about each respective service in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. These services include, among other things, session-based bi-directional communication services that are purchasable by a subscriber on an individualized basis for a period of time. A purchasable bi-directional communication service may comprise a vendor that communicates remotely with the purchaser over the period of time for which the service is purchased. Particular vendors may offer the flexibility to purchase their respective services for any of a plurality of time durations, reflecting higher pricing for longer periods. Other purchasable bi-directional communication services, such as a person-to-person bi-directional audiovisual phone session, may not involve a vendor at the remote location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> A bi-directional communication service may comprise real-time communication concurrently between a vendor and a plurality of subscribers. With reference to the block diagrams of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> (headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> (DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>), a headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is configured to provide purchasable bi-directional communication services, either as an on-demand or a scheduled reservation service with a plurality of possible delivery durations. In the system headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the BSPG application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> and a plurality of other application servers (not shown) are connected to a digital network control system (DNCS) <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> via an Ethernet connection <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>. The BSPG application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> is responsible for reserving and configuring system resources needed to provide bi-directional communication services, for packaging, configuring and making available to the system the executable software program comprising the BSPG client application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>), and for providing BSPG data <highlight><bold>478</bold></highlight> corresponding to the available bi-directional communication services to the BSPG client application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). A BSPG client application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> executing on processor <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight> in DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> generates a user interface that is displayed on television <highlight><bold>441</bold></highlight> for the subscriber to browse, purchase, and establish individualized bi-directional communication with any from a plurality of bi-directional communication services. This may require, among other things, engaging, preferably, in a direct two-way IP (Internet Protocol) connection with bi-directional communication (BC) servers <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> for a finite period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> As necessary, BSPG application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> configures BC server <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> for bi-directional communication with a component in head end <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> providing external communication. BC server <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> establishes bi-directional communication with a respective service provider (or equivalently, a remote personal destination) via one or more external communication interfaces in headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> connected to BC server <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> via an Ethernet connection <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> for bi-directional information and media transmission. In the event that a respective service provider is within the subscriber network television system spanned by headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, BC server <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> is configured by BSPG application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> for personalized bi-directional communication between a respective service provider (or remote personal destination) in a direct two-way IP connection with BC server <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> serving as a bi-directional gateway. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> External communication interfaces include router <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight>, satellite receiver <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight>, a satellite transceiver <highlight><bold>276</bold></highlight>, a terrestrial receiver or antenna <highlight><bold>378</bold></highlight> and a bi-directional gateway <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> connected to backbone switch <highlight><bold>382</bold></highlight> that in turn is connected to components in head end <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> via Ethernet connection <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>. The bi-directional gateway <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> can be connected to an internet service provider (not shown) and router <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> can be connected to a long-distance data network (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> As will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art, additional external communication interfaces may exist at the head end <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and any external communication interface components may be connected to backbone switch <highlight><bold>382</bold></highlight> or may be connected directly to the Ethernet connection <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>. For instance, a router <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> and gateway <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> may possess Ethernet communication ports and may be directly connected to components in the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> via the Ethernet connection <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> provides complete management, monitoring, and control of the network&apos;s elements and broadcast services provided to users. The DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> provides control and communication functionality by monitoring the DHCTs <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and facilitating messaging between the DHCTs <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and components within the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. When any of the communication functionality is provided by headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> components other than the DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight>, the DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> indirectly provides similar functionality by providing the control and coordination to those other devices that provide the required communication functionality to enact a particular media service. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In one implementation, the DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> includes functional support for client-server applications and other components in the DBDS with its server counterparts, including BFS Server <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> and a service application manager (SAM) server <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight>. Briefly, the client-server application counterparts work in coordination with DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> to effectively utilize the primary features of the interactive television system and manage the sale of an individualized purchased session for a bi-directional communication service. Furthermore, the client-server application software in communication with DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> can effectively allocate bi-directional bandwidth capacity to render a session-based bi-directional communication service and manage impulse or scheduled purchase, in cooperation with the BSPG client application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> includes a session manager <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> and a conditional access system <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight>. The session manager <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> preferably uses the MPEG-2 DSM-CC protocol to coordinate requests for bi-directional communication services from a subscriber using DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, as a non-limiting example, for a purchasable individualized service from a vendor that provides a bi-directional communication service. The session manager <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> processes user to network (U-N) session and respective signaling messages, manages allocation of session-related network resources and supports network management operations. The session manager <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> supports exclusive services, such as the BSPG service, by providing the signaling interface to establish, maintain, and release client initiated exclusive sessions. The session manager <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> acts as a point of contact to the network for the DHCT&apos;s <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in the communications network <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to establish individual sessions. The session manager <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> also defines a resource descriptor structure, which is used to request the network resources within a session. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The conditional access (CA) system <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> communicates with the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the billing system <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> to determine whether a particular subscriber is authorized to receive a BC service. If a DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is not authorized for BC service, the conditional access system <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> insures that such services are not transmitted. The DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> uses a data insertion multiplexer <highlight><bold>329</bold></highlight> and a data QAM <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> to insert the in-band broadcast file system (BFS) data into a compressed data stream, for a non-limiting example, an MPEG-2 transport stream. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The BSPG application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> communicates via the Ethernet connection <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> to a SAM server <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> contained on the DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight>. The SAM server <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> is a server component of a client-server pair of components, with the client component being located at the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Together, the client-server SAM components provide a system in which the user can access services, which are identified by an application to run and one or more parameters, such as particular data, specific to that service. The SAM server <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> also manages the life cycle of the applications on the system, including the definition, activation, and suspension of services they provide and the downloading of the applications into the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> as necessary. The BSPG application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> defines its application to the SAM server <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> and the SAM server <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> instructs the BFS server <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> to add the BSPG client application&apos;s <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) executable code to a carousel (not shown) for distribution to the various DHCTs <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in the network <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The BFS server <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> is a part of a broadcast file system that has a BFS client <highlight><bold>443</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) in each DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in the communications network <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Applications on both the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can access the data stored in the BFS server <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> in a similar manner to a file system found on disc operating systems. The BFS server <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> loads data for applications on a carousel (not shown) that sends data in a cyclical repeated fashion, each cycle approximately the same period of time so that the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> that communicates a request for any particular data may receive it when the user desires the data. Thus, the BFS client <highlight><bold>443</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) contained in the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> that receives the broadcast from the BFS server <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> can implement the application for the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> BSPG data resides in the BSPG application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> as composed for BC services available for the current time and future periods. BC server <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> contains a storage and memory cache that serves as a temporary repository for buffering upstream information, data or media generated by a subscriber during a session of a bi-directional communication service. Likewise, the storage and memory cache in BC server <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> serves as a temporary repository for simultaneously buffering downstream information, data or media generated by a service provider, vendor or remote personal location during a session of an individualized bi-directional communication service. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The BC servers <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> deliver MPEG-2 content to a group of QAM modulators <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>. Media or data from the remote location may comprise live video, audio, graphics, and/or text and be transmitted respectively as an MPEG-2 video and audio program to the subscriber. Graphics, textual or other information may be transmitted as an MPEG-2 private data program. Media or data from the remote location may be pre-recorded rather than a live individualized transmission. The BSPG application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> is responsible for managing the configuration of BC servers <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> and the external communication interfaces. The BC servers <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> are employed to deliver the data, video and/or audio streams that make up the BC services. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The QAM group <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> is actually a multiplex of QAMs that support media transmission to a particular DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The session manager <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> in DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> determines which QAM modulator has access to a particular DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The QAM modulators <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> are also responsible for encrypting the transport stream and inserting other data and information into the stream. The QAM modulators <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> receive the MPEG-2 transport stream from the BC servers <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> and convert it to an encrypted RF signal at a specified frequency (channel). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) modem <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> is responsible for transporting the out-of-band IP (Internet protocol) datagram traffic between the distribution headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and a DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Data from the QPSK modem <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> is routed by headend router <highlight><bold>327</bold></highlight> within the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The headend router <highlight><bold>327</bold></highlight> is also responsible for delivering upstream application traffic, such as a user&apos;s requests for a BC service, to the various application servers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> With reference to the block diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is typically situated within the residence or business of a subscriber. It may be integrated into a device that has a display <highlight><bold>441</bold></highlight>, such as a television set, or it may be a stand-alone unit that couples to an external display <highlight><bold>441</bold></highlight>, such as a display included with a computer or a television, and that processes media transported in television signals for presentation or playback to a subscriber (user of the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>). The DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> preferably comprises a communications interface <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight> for receiving the RF signals, which can include media such as video, audio, graphical and data information, from the tap <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and for providing any reverse information (such as BSPG data as required by a subscriber that has purchased as BSPG service) to the tap <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for transmission back to the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). The DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> further includes a processor <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight> for controlling operations of the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, including a video output port such as an RF output system <highlight><bold>448</bold></highlight> for driving the display <highlight><bold>441</bold></highlight>, a tuner system <highlight><bold>445</bold></highlight> for tuning into a particular television channel to be displayed and for sending and receiving data corresponding to various types of media from the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The tuner system <highlight><bold>445</bold></highlight> includes in one implementation, an out-of-band tuner (OOB) for bi-directional quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) data communication and a quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) tuner for receiving television signals. The OOB coupled with an upstream transmitter enable the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to interface with the network so that the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can provide upstream data to the network, for example via the QPSK or QAM channels. This allows a subscriber to interact with the network to request BSPG services and, if necessary, encryption can be added to the OOB channels to provide privacy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Additionally, DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> includes a receiver <highlight><bold>446</bold></highlight> for receiving externally generated information, such as user inputs or commands for other devices. The DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may also include one or more wireless or wired communication interfaces, also called ports, for receiving and/or transmitting data to other devices. For instance, the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may feature USB (Universal Serial Bus) (for connection to a USB camera or microphone), Ethernet (for connection to a computer), IEEE-1394 (for connection to media devices in an entertainment center), serial, and/or parallel ports. A computer or transmitter may for example, provide the user inputs with buttons or keys located either on the exterior of the terminal or by a hand-held remote control device <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> or keyboard that includes user-actuated buttons. In the case of bi-directional services, a user input device may include audiovisual information such as a camera, microphone, or videophone. As a non-limiting example, the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may feature USB or IEEE-1394 for connection of an infrared wireless remote control <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> or a wired or wireless keyboard, a camcorder with an integrated microphone or to a video camera and a separate microphone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Technology for digitizing and compressing/decompressing video and speech signals is well-known in the art. In a preferred embodiment, the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the present invention has the capability to simultaneously decompress and reconstruct video, audio, graphics and textual data that may, for example, correspond to a live BSPG service. This permits the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to store video and audio in memory in real-time, to scale down the spatial resolution of the video pictures, as necessary, and to composite and display a graphical user interface (GUI) presentation of the video with respective graphical and textual data while simultaneously playing the audio that corresponds to the video. The same process applies in reverse and DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can, for example, digitize and compress pictures from a camera for upstream transmission. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In one implementation, a memory portion <highlight><bold>449</bold></highlight> of the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> includes flash memory <highlight><bold>451</bold></highlight> and dynamic random access memory (DRAM) <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> for storing the executable programs and related data components of various applications and modules for execution by the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Both the flash memory <highlight><bold>451</bold></highlight> and the DRAM memory <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> are coupled to the processor <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight> for storing configuration data and operational parameters, such as commands that are recognized by the processor <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Basic functionality of the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is provided by an operating system <highlight><bold>453</bold></highlight> that is contained in flash memory <highlight><bold>451</bold></highlight>. One or more programmed software applications, herein referred to as applications, are executed by utilizing the computing resources in the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The application executable program stored in flash memory <highlight><bold>451</bold></highlight> or DRAM memory <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> is executed by processor <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight> (e.g., a central processing unit or digital signal processor) under the auspices of the operating system <highlight><bold>453</bold></highlight>. Data required as input by the application program is stored in DRAM memory <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> and read by the processor <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight> from DRAM memory <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight> as needed during the course of application program execution. Input data may be data stored in DRAM memory <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> by a secondary application or other source, either internal or external to the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, or possibly anticipated by the application and thus created with the application program at the time it was generated as a software application program, in which case it is stored in flash memory <highlight><bold>451</bold></highlight>. Data may be received via any of the communication ports of the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, from the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> via the DHCT&apos;s network interface (i.e., the QAM or out-of-band tuners) or as user input via receiver <highlight><bold>446</bold></highlight>. A type of input data fulfills and serves the purpose of parameters as described below. Data generated by application program is stored in DRAM memory <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> by the processor <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight> during the course of application program execution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The flash memory <highlight><bold>451</bold></highlight> also contains a platform library <highlight><bold>456</bold></highlight>. The platform library <highlight><bold>456</bold></highlight> is a collection of functionality useful to applications, such as a timer manager, compression manager (for compressing text, video and/or audio), database manager, string managers, and other utilities (not shown). These utilities are accessed by applications as necessary so that each application does not have to contain these utilities thus resulting in memory consumption savings and a consistent user interface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The client component SAM <highlight><bold>457</bold></highlight> (hereinafter the SAM client <highlight><bold>457</bold></highlight>) of the client-server pair of components provides a model in which the user can access services available on the system. A service consists of an application to run and a parameter, such as data content, specific to that service. The SAM client <highlight><bold>457</bold></highlight> handles the lifecycle of the applications on the system, including the definition, initiation, activation, suspension and deletion of services they provide and the downloading of the application into the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> as necessary. Many services can be defined using the same application component, with different parameters. The SAM client <highlight><bold>457</bold></highlight> is a part of the platform <highlight><bold>456</bold></highlight>. As a non-limiting example, an application to tune video programming could be executed with one set of parameters to view HBO and a separate set of parameters to view CNN. Each association of the application component (tune video) and one parameter component (HBO or CNN) represent a particular service that has a unique service ID. The Client SAM <highlight><bold>457</bold></highlight> also interfaces with the resource manager <highlight><bold>467</bold></highlight> to control resources of the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> An application client is the portion of an application that executes on the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and provides the application&apos;s services to the user typically through a graphical user interface. Also contained in flash memory <highlight><bold>451</bold></highlight> is a navigator application <highlight><bold>455</bold></highlight> which provides a navigation framework for the user to access services available on the cable system. Examples of the services include, in one implementation, watching television and pay-per-view events, listening to digital music, and an interactive bi-directional service program guide, each of which is controlled through separate applications in flash memory <highlight><bold>451</bold></highlight>. The navigator <highlight><bold>455</bold></highlight> also allows users to access various settings of the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, including volume, parental control and VCR commands. Moreover, the navigator <highlight><bold>455</bold></highlight> provides users with television related menu options that correspond to DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> functions such as interactive program guides, channel blocking and/or displaying a BSPG purchase list. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The traditional interactive program guide (IPG), Watch TV <highlight><bold>462</bold></highlight>, and pay-per-view (PPV) are examples of resident applications in flash memory <highlight><bold>451</bold></highlight>. The IPG displays a program guide to the user and populates the guide with program data for selection. Watch TV <highlight><bold>462</bold></highlight> enables a user to simply &ldquo;watch television&rdquo; while PPV enables viewing of premium television services. These applications, because they are in flash memory <highlight><bold>451</bold></highlight>, are available to the user and do not need to be downloaded each time the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> initializes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The applications that are stored in the DRAM <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> may be applications that are loaded when the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> initializes or are applications that are downloaded to the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> upon a user-initiated command using an input device such as the remote <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight>. In a non-limiting example, DRAM memory <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> may contain the following application clients (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;application(s)&rdquo;): a video-on-demand application (VOD) <highlight><bold>463</bold></highlight>, an e-mail application <highlight><bold>465</bold></highlight> and a digital music application. Additionally, DRAM memory <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> could also contain a calendar and/or a calculator application. It will be obvious to one with ordinary skill in the art that these applications are illustrative and merely serve as examples of possible embodiments of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The applications discussed above and other applications provided by a cable system operator are top level software entities on the network for providing services to the user. In one implementation, all applications executing on the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> work with the navigator <highlight><bold>455</bold></highlight> by abiding by several guidelines. For example, an application should first utilize and implement the SAM client <highlight><bold>457</bold></highlight> for provisioning, activation, and suspension of services. Second, an application should share DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> resources with other applications and abide by the resource management policies of the SAM client <highlight><bold>457</bold></highlight>, the operating system <highlight><bold>453</bold></highlight>, and the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Third, an application should handle all situations where resources are unavailable without navigator <highlight><bold>455</bold></highlight> intervention. Fourth, when an application loses service authorization while providing a service, an application should suspend the service gracefully. The navigator <highlight><bold>455</bold></highlight> will reactivate an individual service application when it later becomes authorized. Finally, an application should be configured so it does not respond to input commands reserved for the navigator. For instance, as a non-limiting example, when user input commands are entered via a wireless remote control device <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> or keyboard, the application should be configured so it does not have access to certain user input keys that are reserved by the navigator <highlight><bold>455</bold></highlight> (i.e., power, channel &plus;/&minus;, volume &plus;/&minus;, etc.). Without limitation to the foregoing, in some circumstances certain applications during the course of program execution may reach a machine-state in which input keys that would ordinarily be reserved may be employed for input by the application but only during that particular machine-state. For instance, an application may display a user interface that specifically requests input or selection from the user in which one or more of the reserved keys are used momentarily during that machine-state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Other forms of input are subject to similar configuration so that DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> does not respond to input commands reserved for the navigator <highlight><bold>455</bold></highlight>. For example, a video or speech signal in a DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> that is input from a wired or wireless microphone and has been digitized and compressed in the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> as part of a BSPG service session would be subject to this configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> In an alternate embodiment, an audio input port (not shown as a separate input) in the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> comprises a single receiver device. In such an embodiment, the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has digital signal processing capability that implements a subtraction filter to effect subtraction of the audio generated by the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> from the speech signal received from the user (and for echo cancellation). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Another application shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> that is contained in DRAM memory <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> is the bi-directional services program guide client application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;BSPG client application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight>&rdquo;). BSPG client application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> preferably is downloaded into DRAM <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> from the head end <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the BSPG client application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> may be resident in flash memory <highlight><bold>451</bold></highlight>. Similar to an EPG application that has an EPG database of records in which program information is supported by client-server EPG counterparts, the BSPG client application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> employs a BSPG database <highlight><bold>478</bold></highlight> of records that comprises of information pertaining to bi-directional communication services for presentation to a subscriber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> A bi-directional communication service is rendered as a session-based service effected by the head end <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> components as described above. Among other things, session-based bi-directional communication services include services that are purchasable by a subscriber on an individualized basis for a period of time. A purchasable bi-directional communication service may comprise a vendor that communicates remotely with the purchaser over the period of time for which the service is purchased. Particular vendors may offer the flexibility to purchase their respective services for any from a plurality of time durations, reflecting higher pricing for longer periods. Other purchasable bi-directional communication services, such as a person-to-person bi-directional audiovisual phone session, may not involve a vendor at the remote location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> A session for a bi-directional communication service may comprise communication concurrently between a vendor and a plurality of subscribers and a session for a bi-directional communication service may comprise real-time communication between a subscriber and a vendor or friend. Alternatively, a subscriber can purchase a bi-directional communication service for a future period resulting in a purchased reservation for the respective service. Hence, a bi-directional communication service may be fulfilled as a scheduled session per an advanced purchase by a subscriber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The BSPG database <highlight><bold>478</bold></highlight> contains sufficient information for the presentation of available bi-directional communication services at the current time and for subsequent periods. The BSPG application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> in communication with BSPG client application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> effects updates to the BSPG database <highlight><bold>478</bold></highlight> stored in memory <highlight><bold>449</bold></highlight> or in a storage device connected internally or externally to DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> via a data communication port such as a USB (Universal Serial Bus) or IEEE-1394. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The BSPG client application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> consists of a GUI that may be customized remotely by the system operator and updated as program data is received by the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> via its cable communication interface. The BPSG client application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> receives input commands generated by a user via an input device such as a remote control device <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> or via the input communication port <highlight><bold>474</bold></highlight> in DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> BSPG client application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> reads records in BSPG database <highlight><bold>478</bold></highlight> and processes them into a displayable representation as part of a GUI presentation displayed on a television <highlight><bold>441</bold></highlight> or similar display device for presentation to a subscriber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> BSPG information associated with a bi-directional communication services is transmitted on a regular or periodic basis from the BSPG application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) to one or more DHCTs <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. BSPG information may comprise descriptive information to populate the entries of a BSPG presentation, a service guide, or an EPG presentation with the corresponding BSPG fields that are presented to the subscriber via a Graphical-User-Interface (GUI) from which a subscriber can select and request additional descriptive information about respective bi-directional communication services. Hence, per BC service information in the displayed presentation to the subscriber, the subscriber can retrieve and view (and hear if applicable) information specific to a BC service and proceed to select and purchase a specific BC service for a price over a period of time. BSPG information comprises data organized into database records with fields containing, but not limited to, information such as a service title, service content description, service category, name of vendor providing service, one or more names of individuals representing vendor that are available to fulfill the service, and service&apos;s rating information. The BSPG database <highlight><bold>478</bold></highlight> comprises additional data, including a plurality of purchasable durations with price for each respective service; an indication of whether a service can be optionally recorded by the purchaser for an additional price; one or more time intervals for which a service is available during the day; days of the week for which a service can be purchased; and a calendar window comprising a start date and an end date for which a service is offered. A service may be offered indefinitely. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Options for purchasing a package for multiple sessions of a service can be included in the BSPG database. BSPG database records may also include information such as service active times, service titles, service descriptions, service genres, casts lists, ratings information, price criteria (or combinations of multiple price criteria) associated with various viewing options, service durations, and/or links to additional respective program related information such as service previews. The effective window of days and times in which a service is available for purchase may also be included. Further, geographical information related to purchasable services may be included in the database records, such as time zone, geographical location and language(s) of merchant. Other illustrative information that may be present includes type of service (e.g. audio or video or both) and video quality/resolution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The BSPG database <highlight><bold>478</bold></highlight> includes additional information associated with each respective service&apos;s availability at the current time. Preferably, the BSPG database <highlight><bold>478</bold></highlight> includes a separate &ldquo;availability table&rdquo; of entries, each entry respectively associated with a respective service, each service having an index number for which the table can be rapidly be indexed with a service&apos;s number, and each entry respectively indicating whether a service is available at a selected time. Whereas the BSPG information associated with a bi-directional communication services is transmitted on a regular or periodic basis from the BSPG application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) to one or more DHCTs <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the &ldquo;availability table&rdquo; or one or more subsets thereof, is transmitted asynchronously and on a more frequent basis as need be to update the availability status of services at the current time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The BSPG information and availability table are transmitted in a preferred embodiment from the BSPG server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> to one or more DHCTs <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> via the BFS server <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight>. The BPSG receives updates to the BSPG database <highlight><bold>478</bold></highlight> and/or the availability table via the BFS client <highlight><bold>443</bold></highlight>. Updates may be effected immediately or, in an alternate embodiment, at periodic intervals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> A type of purchasable bi-directional service offered by a vendor comprises a finite number of instantiations according to the resources and/or number of individuals that the vendor has to render the service from the remote location. For example, a personalized auto diagnostic service may feature four different mechanics with four respective sets of audio-visual equipment and communication interfaces to render its service. On the other hand, certain services may have resources for only one instantiation of the service. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Upon a session set-up for an available purchased service to a first purchaser, the BSPG server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> momentarily withholds grants to a second purchaser for the same service and immediately determines if the session constitutes the last available instantiation for that service. If a service&apos;s available instantiations are exhausted, the BFS server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> denies service to the second purchaser and alternatively the BSPG client <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> queries the purchaser to schedule a future time or to purchase another service. Simultaneously upon determining that a session constitutes the last instantiation of a service, the BSPG server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> updates the availability table information to indicate that the respective service is not currently available and the updated availability table or a subset thereof is loaded into the BFS server <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> where it is immediately broadcast through the communications network <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The version of the corresponding BFS file is automatically updated by the BFS server <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> and causes DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to be signaled for reception for an updated file. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is another depiction of selected elements of the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> including some of the elements previously discussed. This figure shows a tuner system <highlight><bold>445</bold></highlight> that can select one of a plurality of transmission channels provided by a communications network <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of a subscriber television system such as, for a non-limiting example, a digital cable TV network or a DBDS. The tuner system <highlight><bold>445</bold></highlight> enables the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to tune to upstream media and data transmissions, thereby allowing a user to receive digital video, audio and data content associated with a program or a bi-directional communication service content transmitted via the subscriber network television system. Also included within the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are an out of band (OOB) tuner and upstream transmitter <highlight><bold>547</bold></highlight> connected to the communications interface <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight>. It should be appreciated that although the OOB tuner and upstream transmitter <highlight><bold>547</bold></highlight> are illustrated as one component in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the tuner and transmitter can be independent of each other and located separately within the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Nonetheless, both components are in communication with the subscriber network television system so that upstream transmissions can be received by the system during a bi-directional communication service. The OOB tuner and upstream transmitter <highlight><bold>547</bold></highlight> enable the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to interface with a subscriber network television system so that the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can provide upstream data to the network, for example, via a QPSK channel that serves as an upstream OOB channel (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) and received by a QPSK receiver in QPSK modem <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> in headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. In this manner, a subscriber can interact with the subscriber network television system to request services or a service&apos;s data such as, for a non-limiting example, BC services and BSPG data, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, upstream data transmission can be effected via a QAM channel with a QAM transmitter in DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and a QAM receiver in headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, a telephone modem (not shown) in the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be utilized for upstream data transmission and a headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> or hub <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or other component located upstream in the subscriber network television system may receive data from a telephone network coupled to a telephone modem and can route the upstream data to a destination internal or external to the subscriber network television system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> The DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> includes a demultiplexing system <highlight><bold>543</bold></highlight> comprising functionality for QAM demodulation, forward error correction (FEC), transport demultiplexing, decryption, and parsing, as is well known in the art, to counter the effect of signal processing of broadcast media and data in the subscriber network television system. Transport demultiplexing preferably includes MPEG-2 transport demultiplexing. The demultiplexing system <highlight><bold>543</bold></highlight> in communication with communication interface <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight>, tuner system <highlight><bold>445</bold></highlight> and processor <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight> effects reception of compressed video streams, compressed audio streams, and compressed data streams corresponding to a selected or requested BC service to be separated from other programs and/or streams transported in the tuned transmission channel and to be eventually presented to the subscriber in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention. The DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> also includes a media engine <highlight><bold>580</bold></highlight> configured with elements for driving the television display <highlight><bold>441</bold></highlight>, in cooperation with output system <highlight><bold>448</bold></highlight>, wherein the media engine <highlight><bold>580</bold></highlight> also includes decoding circuitry <highlight><bold>598</bold></highlight> to decode compressed digital video and digital audio and data. Data packets from media and/or data streams corresponding to a session of a BC service that are stored in media memory <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight> are decompressed by decoding circuitry and reconstructed for presentation and playback. Further elements include media memory <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight>, which is used to store compressed media and data packets and the respective reconstructed version corresponding to a program being viewed or to a purchased BC service. The reconstructed representation of the media streams as well as graphical information that comprise a graphical user-interface are displayed for presentation to the viewer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Data packets from media and/or data streams corresponding to a session of a BC service that are stored in media memory <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight> are decompressed by decoding circuitry and reconstructed for presentation and playback. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The security processor <highlight><bold>565</bold></highlight> is a secure element for performing security and conditional access related functions. More particularly, the security processor <highlight><bold>565</bold></highlight> functions to authorize a paying subscriber&apos;s DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to execute specialized functionality of the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, such as receiving and decrypting (or descrambling) encrypted (or scrambled) media and other data sent from a remote device. Security processor <highlight><bold>565</bold></highlight> preferably includes a microprocessor, and a memory that only the microprocessor of the security processor <highlight><bold>565</bold></highlight> may access. Preferably, security processor <highlight><bold>565</bold></highlight> is contained in a tamper proof package. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, in one implementation, media streams from the remote destination comprising a BC session, are received via an external communication interface in the head end <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> or from within headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (as described above) and sent to the BC server <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>. Communication with the BC server <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> may comprise a secured IP connection in which a resident encryption mechanism is negotiated and exercised by the remote destination and the BC server <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, encryption may not be applied between the remote destination and the BC server <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Encryption is applied to the data stream of the requested media, for a non-limiting example the respective media streams from the remote destination comprising a BC session, and at the QAM group <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> at the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> according to encryption methods well-known to those skilled in the art. An encryption component resident in the QAM group <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> in the head end <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and under the direction of the DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> encrypts, for a non-limiting example, MPEG-2 transport stream packets used to transmit the BC session&apos;s streams. The encrypted streams also include, in one embodiment, entitlement control messages that are recognized by the security processor <highlight><bold>565</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) at the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> as information is needed to decrypt the encrypted BC session&apos;s streams. The security processor <highlight><bold>565</bold></highlight> preferably stores authorization information, wherein the authorization information indicates that the subscriber is entitled to access the BC session&apos;s streams. The authorization information is obtained from one or more entitlement messages sent by the head end <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> after, or concurrently with, initialization of the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> into a purchased BC service. If the authorization information indicates that the subscriber is entitled to the BC session&apos;s streams, the security processor <highlight><bold>565</bold></highlight> generates a code word or key based on the authorization information and the received entitlement control message, and the security processor <highlight><bold>565</bold></highlight> uses this key to decrypt the encrypted BC session&apos;s streams at the decryptor <highlight><bold>588</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> The DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> includes an internal clock <highlight><bold>582</bold></highlight> and timers <highlight><bold>590</bold></highlight> that enable computation of the time relationship between its internal clock and the clock specified by the received BC session&apos;s streams. Hence, by reading and interpreting the clock and time stamps specifications intrinsic in the BC session&apos;s streams (for example, as provisioned in MPEG-2), or as communicated by the head end <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> via the out of band pathway or channel, the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can effect an output for the media and/or information received from the remote location as a synchronized presentation to the user that includes reconstructed video pictures, the reconstructed digital audio samples, and supplementary information that emanated from the remote location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Under the auspices of the real-time operating system <highlight><bold>453</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) executed by processor <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight>, and in coordination with BSPG client application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight>, received packets corresponding to the BC session&apos;s media streams and/or data are received in DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> via communications interface <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight> and stored in a temporary buffer in memory <highlight><bold>449</bold></highlight>. The temporary buffer is implemented and managed as a circular buffer to enable data transfers from the temporary buffer to the media memory <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight> in concert with the insertion of newly arriving packets into the temporary buffer. Packets are read from the temporary buffer in memory <highlight><bold>449</bold></highlight> and written to media memory <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight> in a sufficiently fast manner. Orchestration of multiple simultaneous data transfer operations is effected so that while packets are being transferred from memory <highlight><bold>449</bold></highlight> to media memory <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight>, new packets are received and stored in the temporary buffer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the BSPG client application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> provides the user with a presentation of available bi-directional services to choose from and can check the availability of and purchase the requested service for a duration of time. The BSPG client application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> provides bi-directional services to the user by engaging, preferably, in a direct two-way IP connection with BC servers <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> The BSPG client application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> configures the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for the reception and transmission, purchase, and billing of a purchased BC service for a period of time. The BSPG client application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> also provides for a user interface for the specification of options for purchasing a BC service from a plurality of time durations, reflecting higher pricing for longer periods, in cooperation with the BSPG application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) and in cooperation with other head end <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> components, including the pricing system <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight>. Regarding the billing functionality, after a purchase transaction has occurred and the purchase is acknowledged, the purchase is recorded for billing purposes. In one embodiment, the BSPG client application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> configures the processor <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight> to cause BSPG purchase transactions to be stored in the FLASH memory <highlight><bold>451</bold></highlight> part of system memory <highlight><bold>449</bold></highlight> or in some other designated nonvolatile memory section of DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> as purchase transactions occur. BSPG transaction records and associated fees are transmitted upstream via the OOB upstream channel at designated scheduled times (e.g., during low bandwidth consumption periods) to the billing system <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the BSPG application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight>, under the direction of the billing system <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, may periodically poll individual DHCTs <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> or group of DHCTs to collect their respective BSPG transaction history. BSPG transaction records received from subscriber&apos;s DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> by the BSPG application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> are debited from subscriber&apos;s respective account by the billing system <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> BSPG data associated with BC services is transmitted on a regular or periodic basis from the BSPG application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> to one or more DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. BSPG information may comprise descriptive information to populate the entries of a service guide or the corresponding BSPG fields of an EPG that is presented to the subscriber via a GUI from which a subscriber can select and request additional descriptive information about respective BSPG services. Hence, per BSPG title information in the displayed presentation to the subscriber, the subscriber can retrieve and view information specific to a BC service and proceed to purchase specific a BC service for a specified period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The BSPG client application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> can offer the user a plurality of choices, wherein the user may select from pre-configured options from an input device such as a wired or wireless keyboard or remote control <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> to purchase a BC service for one of various durations and from options to purchase the service at the current time impulsively or at any of various future periods of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> The BSPG client application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> also preferably tracks periods and consumption for active services and determines whether the service access time is about to expire. Hence, the BSPG client application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> performs a &ldquo;remaining time&rdquo; comparison for each user-effected service purchased. When the BSPG client application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> determines that the remaining service access time approaches the cross point in time for which the service is to expire, it alerts the user to the situation via a warning barker or banner that is displayed via the television <highlight><bold>441</bold></highlight>. Alternatively a user can be alerted via a blinking light on the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and/or via a sound signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> When a user selects a bi-directional service, the BSPG client application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> confirms availability of the service and waits for a start of service notification from the BSPG application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight>. As stated above, when required, the BSPG application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> updates the availability table when all available instantiations for a service are consumed. Updates may be effected immediately or, in an alternate embodiment, at short periodic intervals. Thus, when a user selects a bi-directional service, the BSPG will be updated to reflect that use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Upon a user instantiating a purchase of a bi-directional service for a price via the displayed graphical interface (i.e., the subscriber enters input via an input device and such input may comprise a password or PIN to authenticate authorization to purchase service), a purchase transaction is executed by the processor <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight> or some other processor in DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> that causes a session to be set-up between subscriber network television system resources to the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. A logical connection between the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and a remote location for the BC service is established. The remote location may involve bi-directional exchange of audio-visual or other information via a router <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight>, bi-directional gateway <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> or BC server <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>. As facilitated by the session manager <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> in the DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight>, a session is a logical entity used to define a connection between the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the BC server <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> and the resources used to maintain that connection in the subscriber network television system. The session manager <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> coordinates and effects the signaling required to implement the session which is preferably defined by the MPEG-2 standard&apos;s ISO/IEC 13818-6 IS (MPEG-2 DSM-CC). Upon a session setup request generated by the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (usually in response to a request from a subscriber), the DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> verifies the eligibility of the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to receive the bi-directional service being requested and then passes the request to the BSPG server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> If the BSPG server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> determines that it can deliver the service, it communicates with the DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> to reserve the network resources required for the requested service. The DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> in communication with BC servers <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> allocates the requested resources, including the necessary bandwidth, and sends a message back to the BSPG server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> to indicate that the requested resources have been allocated. This message contains MPEG-2 transport stream ID, identifying the physical connection from a router <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> or bi-directional gateway <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> to the BC server <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>, and the connectivity from the BC server <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> to the QAM <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> to the Hub <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in which the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is connected. The amount of bi-directional bandwidth that will be reserved for the duration of the bi-directional services session is also communicated to the relevant servers and headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> components. Bandwidth allocation entails an assignment of system resources for a time interval for delivering a bi-directional service. The time interval is characterized by a specific start time and duration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Via the messaging capabilities of the DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight>, the BSPG server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> next sends a message to the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> that indicates that it is ready to begin delivering the bi-directional service video and audio content using the resources allocated. The DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> receives information in the message identifying the QAM Modulator that is transmitting the video content (and hence where to tune to receive the requested content) and the bandwidth allocated to deliver the service. After a session has been established, the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> communicates directly with the BC server <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> to facilitate delivery of the requested service. Throughout the course of time that a bi-directional service is active further messaging is conducted between the respective DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> receiving the BSPG service and the BSPG server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> and/or the BC server <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> via the DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> to monitor the status of the session. Thus, the BSPG server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> can monitor that a session is properly functioning. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> As aforementioned, a user may select a bi-directional service by navigating through a displayed BSPG GUI presentation by manipulating designated buttons of a wired or wireless remote device <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight>. The selection of a bi-directional service or entry from the BSPG client application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> invokes a query as to the availability of the selected service. The query is translated into one or more application executable calls that are executed by the navigator <highlight><bold>455</bold></highlight> and the SAM client <highlight><bold>457</bold></highlight> to activate the requested service. Any of a multiplicity of bi-directional services may be activated through the BSPG client application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> and its corresponding interface (discussed below). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> References to the selection of a service or entry from the multiplicity of services and/or entries displayed by the BSPG client application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> on the display <highlight><bold>441</bold></highlight> comprise the process of interactively navigating by moving the highlight cursor and transmitting input commands to the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The processor <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight> processes data extracted and/or interpreted from the input commands to effect visual cursor position and visual feedback of the user&apos;s selection on the display <highlight><bold>441</bold></highlight>. When the user inputs a selection, the processor <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight> invokes communication between internal components in the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, including software components such as the navigator <highlight><bold>455</bold></highlight> and SAM client <highlight><bold>457</bold></highlight>, to activate the selected service. The processor <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight> employs the messaging services of the operating system <highlight><bold>453</bold></highlight> to effect the communication between any two or more of the internal components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a diagram of the display <highlight><bold>441</bold></highlight> with a BSPG presentation <highlight><bold>670</bold></highlight> presented to the user by the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The BSPG presentation <highlight><bold>670</bold></highlight> is displayed upon activation of the BSPG GUI. At activation, a navigable menu <highlight><bold>672</bold></highlight> is presented to the user. In one embodiment, the BSPG presentation <highlight><bold>670</bold></highlight> includes a series of navigable and selectable bi-directional services <highlight><bold>676</bold></highlight> that link the subscriber to a selected service. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> A system operator at the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> uses the BSPG server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) to a priori configure the BC services and respective BSPG database <highlight><bold>478</bold></highlight> for display in the BSPG presentation <highlight><bold>670</bold></highlight> depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> A BSPG server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> generates a version of the BSPG database <highlight><bold>478</bold></highlight> that identifies the particular services offered, so that when the subscriber selects one of the service links <highlight><bold>676</bold></highlight> the BSPG <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> knows which service to activate. BSPG program information is coalesced and stored in the BSPG server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> at the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> for transmission to DHCTs <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> throughout the communications network <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> as the BSPG database <highlight><bold>478</bold></highlight>, or only to those DHCTs authorized to receive BSPG data. The BSPG server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> formats the BSPG database <highlight><bold>478</bold></highlight> into a format interpretable by the BSPG client application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> running in the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and feeds the data via the BFS from the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> for downstream transmission to the DHCTs <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> A record of the BSPG database <highlight><bold>478</bold></highlight> that corresponds to a selected bi-directional service may, for example, include a short description of the service and a reference the target service and application that provides the service. Similarly, the SAM service ID or the actual channel assigned to a desired service may also be used to activate a service. Examples of bi-directional services that can be included in the BSPG presentation <highlight><bold>670</bold></highlight> include, but are not limited to, those provided by the following applications: personalized expert advice, personalized adult entertainment, personalized education, or personalized medical assistance. In a preferred embodiment, any bi-directional service available to the user in the cable system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be accessed via the BSPG presentation <highlight><bold>670</bold></highlight>, as configured by the system operator and/or in the respective alternate embodiments as configured by the user to reflect a user&apos;s own customization and preferences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, BSPG database information for each bi-directional service is displayed in the BSPG presentation <highlight><bold>670</bold></highlight> in a grid format (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) to enable scrolling through the plurality of services by time and service. As a non-limiting example, an information key on a remote device <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> may be configured to instruct the BSPG client application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> to display the information corresponding to a selectable bi-directional service. As another non-limiting example, the BSPG presentation <highlight><bold>670</bold></highlight> may immediately present additional information about a selectable bi-directional service after the user moves the cursor <highlight><bold>678</bold></highlight> onto the selectable area of the BSPG presentation <highlight><bold>670</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Bi-directional service authorization information is available to the BSPG <highlight><bold>670</bold></highlight> via the SAM. A user may select a bi-directional service link <highlight><bold>676</bold></highlight> displayed in the BSPG presentation <highlight><bold>670</bold></highlight> and the request for the process of granting the bi-directional service will proceed only if the user is authorized. If the user is not authorized, visual or audio feedback such as a &ldquo;grayed out&rdquo; area should be displayed to indicate that the user may not select the link label <highlight><bold>676</bold></highlight> for activation of that service. Alternatively, unauthorized services may not be displayed at all. Alternatively, unauthorized services are coalesced into a service category such as &ldquo;Other Purchasable Services&rdquo; or &ldquo;Other Available Services.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Either the system operator of the cable television system or the user of the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may configure the display status of the respective bi-directional service link <highlight><bold>676</bold></highlight> with respect to authorization status and availability of the target service. Alternatively, the BSPG server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> automatically generates availability and status information for each respective bi-directional service via transmission of updated availability table as previously described. The user, through a settings menu (not shown) may configure the BSPG presentation <highlight><bold>670</bold></highlight> so that the display mode of one or more selectable bi-directional services links <highlight><bold>676</bold></highlight> is &ldquo;inactive&rdquo; or &ldquo;none&rdquo; so the display of the selectable bi-directional service conforms to the display modes described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is an example of a main session purchase screen <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> illustrating the main screen following the selection of a first BC service by the subscriber in a BSPG presentation <highlight><bold>670</bold></highlight>. The main purchase screen displays features provided by the BSPG application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). The example main session purchase screen <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> includes a title header <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> suggesting to the user the purpose of the screen, and a subtitle header <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> indicating which hierarchical level of the session purchase screen displays is currently displayed, in this instance, a main screen <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>. Example main screen <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> includes an information window <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> that provides brief descriptive information, such as, for a non-limiting example, service title, rating, availability, service description, duration, and price. More or less information may be included according to the information available in the BSPG database <highlight><bold>478</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Example session main screen <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> also includes several pre-configured lists, such as query list <highlight><bold>724</bold></highlight>, options list <highlight><bold>722</bold></highlight>, and functions list <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight>. List <highlight><bold>722</bold></highlight> changes accordingly to the subscriber&apos;s selection of a respective entry in query list <highlight><bold>724</bold></highlight>. Hence, the options list <highlight><bold>722</bold></highlight> changes to a display corresponding to price-per-duration displays upon the subscriber selecting the price entry in query list <highlight><bold>724</bold></highlight>. Each of these pre-configured lists includes information within a series of windows <highlight><bold>725</bold></highlight>. The information in these lists will preferably be defaulted to the selection corresponding to the shown highlighted window <highlight><bold>726</bold></highlight> of each list based on the characterizing information corresponding to the BC service selection. Other embodiments are possible, such as a configuration screen (not shown) wherein the user categorizes the session for a BC service according to his or her own personal definitions. For a non-limiting example, query list <highlight><bold>724</bold></highlight> includes such queries for a session of a BC service as availability, price, and duration, as well as more query options not shown. The default selection highlighted by highlighted window <highlight><bold>726</bold></highlight> corresponds to the fact that a user can query about a plurality of price options for the selected BC service, i.e. Tae Bo as a non-limiting example. Options list <highlight><bold>722</bold></highlight> defaults to &ldquo;$20 for 15 min as this corresponds to the least-expensive available option of the Tae Bo BC service. Although these are default selections, the user is free to scroll the highlighted window <highlight><bold>726</bold></highlight> of each list to enter his or her desired query. As with any of the lists shown and described on the current and subsequent screens, the user may advance from one window to the next window within a list by using the up and down arrow keys of the remote control device, as suggested by up arrow <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight> and down arrow <highlight><bold>734</bold></highlight>. There are many variations of the advancing function. Preferably, the user advances highlighted window <highlight><bold>726</bold></highlight> in each list up or down to highlight the entry in window <highlight><bold>725</bold></highlight> containing the information desired. Alternatively, the windows in each list may be advanced through highlighted window <highlight><bold>726</bold></highlight>. The preferred embodiment of the invention is not limited to how the user advances to each window <highlight><bold>725</bold></highlight>. The user advances from one list, for a non-limiting example query list <highlight><bold>724</bold></highlight>, to another list, for a non-limiting example options list <highlight><bold>722</bold></highlight>, by using scroll arrows on the remote, as suggested by scroll arrows <highlight><bold>736</bold></highlight>. Scroll arrows <highlight><bold>736</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>738</bold></highlight> correspond to scroll arrows located on a remote device. Category display <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> includes one example default format based on characterizing information corresponding to the selected BC service. In this non-limiting example, since Tae Bo is a &ldquo;Physical Fitness&rdquo; BC service, the category display <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> lists &ldquo;Physical Fitness.&rdquo; Alternate formats may be displayed as well, such as personalized formats created by the user. The scope of the embodiments of the invention is not limited by how data is formatted on the screen displays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> The effective window of calendar days in which a respective BC service is purchasable is displayed within service information window <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>. Alternatively or in addition, it may be included as an entry in query list <highlight><bold>724</bold></highlight> in which upon selection respective options list <highlight><bold>722</bold></highlight> displays an entry for start time and another entry for end time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Once a user has selected a price from option list <highlight><bold>722</bold></highlight> for a session of the Tae Bo BC service, the user can proceed to record the session in a VCR device or storage device attached to DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> by advancing from option list <highlight><bold>722</bold></highlight>, to functions list <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight>, by using scroll arrows on the remote, as suggested by scroll arrows <highlight><bold>738</bold></highlight>. A BC service may entitle a session to be recorded or not recorded. In the even that a BC service does not allow session recording, &ldquo;set record&rdquo; will not appear as an entry in function list <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Recording of BC service&apos;s session may be allowed for an extra price. In one embodiment, a purchasable record option appears as an entry in function list with a price, as a non-limiting example, as &ldquo;set record $5.&rdquo; In an alternate embodiment, option list <highlight><bold>722</bold></highlight> will include price-options entry indicating price for duration and recording as well. For example, the &ldquo;$25 (Rec) for 15 min&rdquo; may indicate to the user the price for the Tae Bo BC service for a 15 minute session that is recordable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> An option for a BC service purchase constitutes a package purchase option in options list <highlight><bold>722</bold></highlight>. In the non-limiting example in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, multiple sessions of the Tae Bo can be purchased for a fee. For example, a user may opt to purchase four 30-minute sessions of a BC service for a discounted price. A first session can be impulsively instigated and the three remaining sessions can be scheduled by navigating through a series of menus or lists in the hierarchy of a session purchase GUI. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Upon selection to &ldquo;wake on availability,&rdquo; the user selects to be notified when a service not currently available becomes available. The user may presented with a displayed pop-up message in the future, while continuing to watch a program television or to consume a second service, that notifies the viewer that a first requested service not previously available has become available. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> A user can also set a reminder timer for a session purchased for a future time slot via function list <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the &ldquo;A&rdquo;, &ldquo;B&rdquo;, and &ldquo;C&rdquo; buttons on the remote <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> may be used to provide certain user interface functionality, as suggested by the corresponding buttons on the example display screen. For instance, &ldquo;A&rdquo; button <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight> enables a user to request more information about a BC service, such as a more thorough description or reviews from other individuals (note: needs claimed). The &ldquo;B&rdquo; button <highlight><bold>742</bold></highlight> provides for enacting the purchase of a session at future periods other than the set of near-term periods presented in the options list when availability is selected in the query list. Return Button <highlight><bold>744</bold></highlight> will return the user to the screen display from where session purchase screen <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> was entered, for example a BSPG screen, by way of non-limiting example. The &ldquo;SEL&rdquo; button <highlight><bold>732</bold></highlight> enables the user to enact the purchase functionality once all desired options and functions have been selected. Buttons &ldquo;A&rdquo;-&ldquo;C&rdquo;, arrow buttons <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>734</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>736</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>738</bold></highlight>, and &ldquo;SEL&rdquo; button <highlight><bold>732</bold></highlight> suggest a one-to-one functional correspondence to similar buttons on a remote device, such as that illustrated as a non-limiting example in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> illustrates a non-limiting example of a remote control device <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> that is used to provide user input to the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The arrow buttons <highlight><bold>882</bold></highlight> include an up arrow button <highlight><bold>883</bold></highlight>, a down arrow button <highlight><bold>884</bold></highlight>, a left arrow button <highlight><bold>885</bold></highlight>, and a right arrow button <highlight><bold>886</bold></highlight> that are used to scroll through options or selections and/or to highlight an option or selection displayed on one of the plurality of user interface screens. The select button <highlight><bold>887</bold></highlight> may be used to select a currently highlighted option or selection that is provided to the user. Lettered button &ldquo;A&rdquo; <highlight><bold>888</bold></highlight>, &ldquo;B&rdquo; <highlight><bold>889</bold></highlight>, and &ldquo;C&rdquo; <highlight><bold>890</bold></highlight> may be used to implement functions on a user interface screen that have the corresponding letter. Numeric buttons <highlight><bold>895</bold></highlight> may be used to enter numbers, or configured with the application to enter letters corresponding to the numeric buttons <highlight><bold>895</bold></highlight>. In describing the example screen displays, it will be understood that &ldquo;selecting&rdquo; or &ldquo;pressing&rdquo; the navigational and lettered buttons on the screen actually require selecting the corresponding remote control device buttons. Many alternative methods of providing user input may be used including a remote control device with different buttons and/or button layouts, a keyboard device, a voice activated device, etc. The embodiments of the invention described herein are not limited by the type of device used to provide user input. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the icon B <highlight><bold>742</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> represents a search operation. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is an example archive search screen <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> responsive to the user selecting the &ldquo;B&rdquo; search button <highlight><bold>742</bold></highlight> in session purchase screen <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> or in the BSPG presentation <highlight><bold>670</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. Note the change in the subtitle header <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> reflecting the current screen purpose. Search window <highlight><bold>924</bold></highlight> enables the user to enter alphanumeric characters to search for BC service or other characterizing information within the BSPG database <highlight><bold>478</bold></highlight>. The user may enter the name of a BC service, or any of the BSPG information and the result display <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight> will display the information found pertaining to one or more BC services upon completion of a search operation in the BSPG database <highlight><bold>478</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> A user may access the BSPG presentation <highlight><bold>670</bold></highlight> in several ways. With reference again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8, a</cross-reference> remote unit <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> is shown with a dedicated key to access the BSPG presentation <highlight><bold>670</bold></highlight>. The navigator <highlight><bold>455</bold></highlight> on the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be configured to activate the BSPG presentation <highlight><bold>670</bold></highlight> whenever the user presses the GUIDE key <highlight><bold>881</bold></highlight> on the remote <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight>. The user may navigate the BSPG presentation <highlight><bold>670</bold></highlight> by pressing the arrow keys to move the cursor <highlight><bold>678</bold></highlight> of the BSPG presentation <highlight><bold>670</bold></highlight> to the desired selectable bi-directional service link <highlight><bold>676</bold></highlight>. Once the user moves the cursor <highlight><bold>678</bold></highlight> to the desired target service or application, the user presses the SEL key <highlight><bold>887</bold></highlight> to select the selectable service link <highlight><bold>676</bold></highlight> corresponding to that target service. If the user desires to exit the BSPG presentation <highlight><bold>670</bold></highlight>, the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be configured to remove the BSPG presentation <highlight><bold>670</bold></highlight> and return to the current TV program if the user presses the GUIDE key <highlight><bold>881</bold></highlight> a second time or the EXIT key <highlight><bold>891</bold></highlight>. It will be clear to one of ordinary skill that virtually any key on the remote <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> may be configured to activate the BSPG presentation <highlight><bold>670</bold></highlight>. Similarly, it will be obvious that the remote <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> may be any type of corded or wireless remote or keyboard or other input devices. Other input commands can be received as signals in DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> by alternate means of receiving input, including voice signals and signals received via a communication port in DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the a user can press the &ldquo;info&rdquo; button <highlight><bold>892</bold></highlight> in order to cause the remaining time for a purchased service to be displayed in a non-obtrusive manner on the television screen. For instance, the remaining time may be displayed on the bottom of the television screen regardless of whether the service presentation is active or in stop mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> The BSPG presentation <highlight><bold>670</bold></highlight> may also be activated by the user upon entering a channel input corresponding to the BSPG service, as defined by the system operator. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is a diagram of the mappings of services to channels wherein the BSPG presentation <highlight><bold>670</bold></highlight> is mapped to a channel of the channel table <highlight><bold>1001</bold></highlight>. The system operator at the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> configures the assignment of services to channels. The channel table <highlight><bold>1001</bold></highlight> is a list of all channels in the cable television system, and the bi-directional service table <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> is a list of all available services or applications provided by the cable television system. The system operator configures the channel line-up by setting the various channels in channel table <highlight><bold>1001</bold></highlight> to point <highlight><bold>1003</bold></highlight> to the various service or application in the bi-directional service table <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight>. A channel in the channel table <highlight><bold>1001</bold></highlight> may point <highlight><bold>1005</bold></highlight> to the BSPG, provided by the BSPG client application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight>, so that the BSPG presentation <highlight><bold>670</bold></highlight> is displayed whenever the user selects that channel. Thus, in a non-limiting example, the BSPG presentation <highlight><bold>670</bold></highlight> is presented to the user upon the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> receiving a command to display channel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the BSPG presentation <highlight><bold>670</bold></highlight> is presented if the user inputs a channel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> command or merely scrolls through the channels and stops on channel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is a screen display diagram of a combination presentation of an interactive program guide (IPG) display <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> that includes a BSPG presentation <highlight><bold>670</bold></highlight>. The IPG display <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> presents current and future viewable programs to the user in a scrollable format based on channel and time. The user may navigate the IPG display <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> to select a current program for immediate viewing. The IPG display <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> is a vertically scrollable list of channel numbers in a channel portion of the display <highlight><bold>1101</bold></highlight> and a horizontally and vertically scrollable program listing display <highlight><bold>1103</bold></highlight> of program services, including bi-directional services, corresponding to the respective channels in the channel portion of the display <highlight><bold>1101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the user navigates a cursor <highlight><bold>1105</bold></highlight> in the program listing display <highlight><bold>1103</bold></highlight> to select the individual program or service for activation. The user in similar fashion may activate bi-directional services by moving the cursor <highlight><bold>1105</bold></highlight> to the bi-directional service listing in the program listing display <highlight><bold>1103</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, a separate program guide, devoted exclusively to bi-directional content, may be listed as a separate channel. In the disclosed embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11, a</cross-reference> BSPG is listed as channel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and may be accessed by moving the cursor <highlight><bold>1105</bold></highlight> over channel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and selecting it with the remote <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight>. In still another example, the BSPG may be a separate guide from the IPG display <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> entirely and may be accessed via separate buttons from the remote <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is a screen display diagram of another embodiment of a BSPG presentation <highlight><bold>670</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, channels akin to those used in the more traditional IPG displays replace the bi-directional service links <highlight><bold>676</bold></highlight>. A bi-directional services menu <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> lists those services available to the subscriber at a given time. Note that the selectable services are arranged in a vertical format such that the subscriber can scroll vertically to view the offered services currently showing on the various channels. Alternatively, the subscriber can scroll horizontally and view the services available at different times on the same channel. As described above, the BSPG presentation <highlight><bold>670</bold></highlight> may be a separate guide from the IPG display <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> or may be an option that the user can select from the IPG display <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is a screen display diagram of another embodiment of a BSPG in a full screen format. In this embodiment, the BSPG presentation <highlight><bold>670</bold></highlight> includes a date and time field <highlight><bold>673</bold></highlight>, a list of channels carrying bi-directional services <highlight><bold>680</bold></highlight>, a description of the bi-directional services offered <highlight><bold>674</bold></highlight>, an availability indicator <highlight><bold>675</bold></highlight> and a next available session indicator <highlight><bold>677</bold></highlight>. In a preferred embodiment, some of the bi-directional services may be subscription-based and the program guide can use different colors and/or textures to distinguish between free and subscription-based services. Alternately, colors and textures can be used to distinguish between types of services offered (audio only, video only or both) or service content (family services versus adult entertainment). These examples are for illustration purposes only and it will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that any of the attributes stored in the BSPG database <highlight><bold>478</bold></highlight> can be graphically distinguished in the BSPG presentation <highlight><bold>670</bold></highlight>. Moreover, the methods used to distinguish between service attributes may be selected by the cable system operator or may be user customizable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, if a user selects one of the listed bi-directional services the user will receive another BSPG presentation <highlight><bold>670</bold></highlight> showing the sessions available for the selected service. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> is a screen display diagram showing the sessions available to a subscriber that has selected Bally&apos;s Exercise Routines from the services listed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. The BSPG presentation <highlight><bold>670</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> includes a bi-directional services session list <highlight><bold>682</bold></highlight> that shows the various sessions available from the selected bi-directional service. For each session, the availability indicator shows the user whether a given bi-directional service session is currently available and, if not currently available, a next available session indicator <highlight><bold>677</bold></highlight> indicates when the session will next be available. In a preferred embodiment, if a user attempts to select a session that is not currently available, the user will receive a audio or visual message indicating that the selected service is not available. Alternatively, unavailable sessions will be listed as &ldquo;grayed out&rdquo; and are not selectable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> From <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14, a</cross-reference> user may scroll through the available sessions within the selected bi-directional service. In a preferred embodiment, the user has the option of pressing the INFO button <highlight><bold>892</bold></highlight> of the wireless remote device <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> to obtain additional information about each session. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> shows an exemplary BSPG session information page <highlight><bold>685</bold></highlight> that includes a detailed description of the offered bi-directional service session <highlight><bold>687</bold></highlight> and a session fee structure <highlight><bold>689</bold></highlight>. At the bottom of the screen, the user has option to purchase the bi-directional service session via the purchase service button <highlight><bold>690</bold></highlight> or to return to the previous screen <highlight><bold>691</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, the user is presented with an interactive program guide (IPG) <highlight><bold>1670</bold></highlight> which has BC icons next to varied media selections, suggesting to the user the availability of a selectable BC service. For a non-limiting example, selections Tae Bo under the PPV category <highlight><bold>1676</bold></highlight> have &ldquo;BC&rdquo; next to them suggesting to the user that these selections are available for session purchase. In another embodiment, the user may be presented with a service guide (SG) option <highlight><bold>1776</bold></highlight> in the example IPG <highlight><bold>1790</bold></highlight> depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. Upon selecting the service guide (SG) option <highlight><bold>1776</bold></highlight>, the user is presented with service selections in a service guide (SG) as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> is an example user service guide (SG) that provides for a plurality of services <highlight><bold>1856</bold></highlight> with BC icons to alert the user to the ability (or inability) to purchase a BC service session. Alternatively, the BSPG service <highlight><bold>1975</bold></highlight> may be a selectable service entity, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>. Selecting the BSPG service <highlight><bold>1975</bold></highlight> from the service guide <highlight><bold>1950</bold></highlight> may present various BC services that are purchasable, categorized, by way of non-limiting example, by BC service categories such as adult entertainment, personal education, personal advice, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> Once the user has decided on a BC service selection, either by entering a selection in an IPG, a service guide, or during a particular GUI presentation, the user is presented with an example session purchase screen <highlight><bold>2000</bold></highlight>, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> BC services under the &ldquo;adult&rdquo; category, such as, for example, a feature Suzie Floosey displayed in the display of a an adult BC service in a BSPG or EPG GUI presentation, are displayed with a lock or PIN icon next to it to reflect PIN access authorization to view this media presentation. The PIN access entry icon may be displayed as a result of the user entering a first PIN access number to allow session purchases of BC services comprising communication of adult material, in accordance with the rating of the BC service. Alternative icons or warning notices or messages alerting the user to PIN access entry requirements may also be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> depicts an example PIN entry window <highlight><bold>2100</bold></highlight> that is presented to the user after the user selects to purchase a session for a BC service example session purchase screen, <highlight><bold>2000</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>. A PIN Entry window <highlight><bold>2100</bold></highlight> is employed during the purchase of a session for a BC service to authenticate authorization to purchase and exercise parental control of purchases. The top portion <highlight><bold>2110</bold></highlight> contains the heading &ldquo;PIN ENTRY&rdquo; while the bottom portion <highlight><bold>2120</bold></highlight> illustrates relevant navigation buttons available on the remote control device <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight>. A user can enter his or her PIN using the remote control device <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> while being presented with the PIN entry window <highlight><bold>2100</bold></highlight>. Center portion <highlight><bold>2130</bold></highlight> contains entry fields <highlight><bold>2140</bold></highlight> that display a &ldquo;*&rdquo; for every PIN entry received from the user. In an alternative embodiment a user is not presented with a PIN entry screen and is not required to enter a PIN. In yet another alternative embodiment, a user is only presented with a PIN entry screen if a session for the selected BC service can be achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> In the described embodiment, the user can purchase a bi-directional service from any of the aforementioned GUI presentations. If the selected service is free, the user&apos;s selection activates the server using the process already described. If, on the other hand, the selected service is subscription-based the user will receive a confirmation screen of the type shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> The BSPG presentation <highlight><bold>670</bold></highlight> is additionally configurable to control the behavior and presence of the bi-directional services links <highlight><bold>676</bold></highlight> based on the parental control status of the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> as maintained by the navigator <highlight><bold>455</bold></highlight> application. Service parental control information is available to the BSPG client application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> via the navigator <highlight><bold>455</bold></highlight>. If the &ldquo;display_mode&rdquo; is &ldquo;active,&rdquo; the service link <highlight><bold>676</bold></highlight> is selectable (shown active) even if the service is blocked. Thus, the user may select the service link <highlight><bold>676</bold></highlight> to the target service, but the BSPG presentation <highlight><bold>670</bold></highlight> will display a pop-up barker indicating that the service is not available because it has been blocked by parental control. If the &ldquo;display_mode&rdquo; is set to &ldquo;inactive,&rdquo; links to bi-directional services that are blocked by parental control are displayed to the user in a &ldquo;grayed out&rdquo; format so that the user may see the service link <highlight><bold>676</bold></highlight> but may not select the link label <highlight><bold>676</bold></highlight> for activation of the underlying target service. Finally, if the &ldquo;display_mode&rdquo; is set to &ldquo;none,&rdquo; links to services that are blocked by parental control are not included in the BSPG presentation <highlight><bold>670</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> Either the system operator of the cable television system or the user of the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may configure the display status of bi-directional service links <highlight><bold>676</bold></highlight> with respect to parental control status of the target service. The system operator may designate the display status with respect to service blocking status by a GUI that graphically configures the BSPG presentation <highlight><bold>670</bold></highlight>. More likely, the user, through a settings menu (not shown), may configure the BSPG presentation <highlight><bold>670</bold></highlight> so that the display mode of one or more service links <highlight><bold>676</bold></highlight> is &ldquo;inactive&rdquo; or &ldquo;none&rdquo; so the display of the selectable graphic conforms to the display modes described above. Alternatively, the user can configure the BSPG presentation <highlight><bold>670</bold></highlight> by calling the automated phone menu system, logging on to a specified secure and encrypted web site, or navigating through a configuration application running in the user&apos;s DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> To offer BSPG service, in one implementation, the subscriber network television system operator assigns a portion of the downstream and upstream bandwidth capacity in the subscriber network television system to be dedicated for transmission of BC services. The amount of bandwidth capacity that can be allocated to the BSPG service is finite. Grants for request to fulfill a session for a BC service may be limited during peak-time periods that correspond to high bandwidth consumption by a plurality of other services. On the other hand, off-peak-time periods may feature unused bandwidth capacity intended for other services that can be repossessed for effecting BC service sessions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the invention, the amount of bandwidth capacity allocated for BC services varies throughout time to reflect bandwidth consumption by a plurality of bandwidth consuming services, including but not limited to VOD services. During peak periods of other bandwidth consuming services such as, for a non-limiting example, VOD, the amount of bandwidth capacity allocated to the BC services is less than during the off-peak periods. Consequently, the number of available BC services during peak-periods may less than during off-peak periods. Lower bit rates resulting in lower picture quality (e.g., lower quality of service) may need to be effected for BC services during peak periods. Pricing for each respective BC service session may or may not vary according to whether the time interval for a purchase session is a peak period or not. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> As a non-limiting example, during peak periods, such as 6:00 to 10:59 P.M. of the week nights, a BC service may exhibit higher pricing whereas during certain, low-demand time periods such as 6:00 to 11:00 A.M of the weekend days the pricing will be lower. Other factors such as demand for a BC service and its popularity may also influence pricing. Therefore, pricing for a BC services may be configured to adapt in a time-specific manner according to a plan and according to such other factors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> Other factors influencing pricing of a BC service include the service content type (e.g., audio, video, and/or data), the session quality (e.g., CD quality or surround sound quality audio; and low bitrate versus high bit-rate picture quality). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> The allocation of system resources such as bandwidth for BC services may be configured to switch as time progresses from a first allocation sub-schedule to a second allocation sub-schedule according to a main schedule that specifies the time interval when each of two or more sub-schedules is to be active as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>. As noted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>, the plan may consist, in one embodiment, of scheduling with multiple schedules <highlight><bold>2210</bold></highlight>, on a per week basis <highlight><bold>2220</bold></highlight>, administered with a plurality of sub-schedules on a daily basis <highlight><bold>2230</bold></highlight> (or alternatively weekly basis). In this embodiment, only one configurable sub-schedule is active at a time throughout the configurable recurring schedule but a first configurable sub-schedule may be active throughout one or more distinct and non-overlapping time intervals of the configurable recurring schedule. The recurrence of the schedule is configured to one of a plurality of time periods such as a weekly, daily, or a monthly recurring schedule. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> According to another possible bandwidth allocation schedule, a multiplicity of time-adaptive schedules for each of a multiplicity of recurring schedule choices are pre-configured. In this embodiment, the cable system operator may monitor the bandwidth and BC service usage and be given the option of manually implementing one of the pre-configured allocation schedules without following a plan. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> may automatically monitor bandwidth usage and automatically select one of the pre-configured. For instance, six different configurations may be available for time-adaptive management of the bandwidth allocated for BC services for a daily recurring schedule. On the other hand, more than six different arrangements may be necessary when implementing time-adaptive bandwidth management on a weekly recurring schedule. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> The pricing system and the allocated bandwidth are inherently related, as the price structure will depend on, among other factors, the time of the BC service session and the duration. In a subscriber network television system that markets BC services with a plurality of prices, a first subscriber may be willing to pay a premium to immediately effect a session of a BC service that is purchased during a peak-period. A second subscriber pays a lesser purchase fee when purchasing a BC service during a peak-period but selecting to schedule the session at a later time corresponding to an off peak-period. In the preferred embodiment, the BSPG service offers a plurality of prices for a BC service session, each respective price is associated with a different combination duration, recording rights, session start time, and picture quality.
