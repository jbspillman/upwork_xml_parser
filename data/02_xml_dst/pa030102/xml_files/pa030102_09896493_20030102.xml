<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to the winding of tape and more particularly to a method and apparatus for using a winding flange guide for improved tape winding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> As the industry moves to higher track densities, higher processing and operating speeds, and thinner, smoother media, the ability to create a high quality wind becomes increasingly critical. This is true whether the strand media is being servowritten, or being used in a cartridge/drive. Current tape processing technology involves using an idler guide to guide the tape as it comes into the pancake and a pack wheel to apply pressure to squeeze out the entrapped air between wraps; higher wind tensions can also help squeeze out the air. The formation of a stable pack depends on one&apos;s ability to achieve asperity to asperity contact between adjacent tape layers, therefore locking the wraps in place on the pancake, before the tape wraps have a chance to slide on the entrapped layers of air. This tape motion can result in scatter winds and popped strands. Popped strands are highly susceptible to edge damage during handling of the pancake and both popped strands and scatter winds result in undesirable tape motion at the recording/servo head. As media becomes smoother, it becomes increasingly difficult to achieve asperity to asperity contact and, consequently, to achieve an acceptable wind or to even wind the tape at all. Increasing the pack force and/or the wind tension are potential ways to overcome this obstacle, but because the industry is moving towards thinner and thinner media, damage to the media as a result of these increased forces becomes an important issue. The present invention will constrain these floating wraps until the entrapped air is expelled and it is possible to move to lower pack forces and wind tensions and still obtain high quality winds, even with thinner, smoother media. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Further problems with packing occur as processing speeds increase. As the tape speed increases, the amount of air that is trapped between layers during winding also increases and pack quality suffers. In this case, the present invention can constrain all of the floating wraps until the entrapped air can be expelled. This permits higher tape processing speeds and, consequently, increased throughput. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Current art for tape cartridges and tape drives uses large flanges to provide an envelope for lateral tape motion (no pack wheel is used). These flanges permit a relatively large amount of lateral tape motion during winding before the tape tension forces out the entrapped air. This often results in scatter winds and subsequent tape motion at the recording head as the pack then unwinds. In fact, the tape will often hit the flanges as it winds/unwinds and this motion is transmitted directly to the head. Because track densities are constantly increasing, any lateral motion at the head becomes very critical because it can lead to servo errors and cartridge failure. By using the present invention in a drive, either with the existing flanges or in place of them, one can reduce and/or eliminate the scatter winds/thrown wraps that result in tape motion at the head and tape edge damage/wear. The present invention can also be used in a cartridge in addition to the flanges or in place of them. If keeping the flanges is desirable (as protection in case the cartridge is dropped, for example), the present invention can be designed to fit inside of the flanges so that it will not interfere with them. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Referring to the drawings, wherein like numerals represent like parts throughout the several views, there is generally disclosed at <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> a winding flange guide. The winding flange guide <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is in the shape of a spool and has a central hub section <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and having a first end <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a second end <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. A first flange <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is operatively connected to the first end <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a second flange <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is operatively connected to the second end <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Preferably, the hub section <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and flanges <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are formed as an integral one-piece unit. The flanges <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are mirror images of each other. The flanges <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> have a lead in angled surface <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a land area <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The hub <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and flanges <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> (the portions that would touch the magnetic tape) are polished to a mirror finish, for example at least 8Ra microinches or better. It is preferred that the finish is 4Ra microinches or better and a finish of 1Ra microinches or better is more preferred. Further, a finish of 0.5 Ra microinches has been used with very good results, it being understood that the finish is better. The hub section <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has a central bore <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>which is used for mounting the winding flange guide <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The distance X, the distance between the lands <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is dependent upon the size of the media being wound. The distance X is between 0.0002 inches to 0.0012 inches larger than the tape media, and preferably between 0.0002 to 0.0007 inches larger than the tape media. This distance allows for a guide <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to promote better winding, as will be discussed more fully hereafter. The lead in surfaces <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>provide for an angled surface to further guide the tape media into the guide <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The length of the land <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is designated by Y in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and represents the distance from the hub <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to the lead in surfaces <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. This distance Y is dependent upon the thickness of the tape media. Preferably, the length of the land <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is preferably 100 times or less than the thickness of the tape media and preferably 60 times or less than the thickness of the tape media. It is necessary to constrain the tape media after several layers have been wrapped. Therefore, the distance Y is preferably always at least 10 times the thickness of the tape media. It has been found that the preferred distance is between 50 to 60 times the thickness of the media. The land area <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are generally parallel to each other, however, there may be a slight outward angle of a small amount such as 0.5 degrees. The angle of the lead in surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is angled approximately 15 degrees to the horizontal. The lands <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>provide for the guiding surfaces, between which the magnetic tape is positioned. The guide <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is preferably an integral one-piece unit, but the components could be made separately and then fastened. Slots <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are a tool relief so the width may be machined precisely. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 through 5</cross-reference> show the winding flange guide <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in use in conjunction with a servo writer, generally designated at 20. Servo writers are well known in the art. The winding flange guide <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be used on any suitable servo writer. Only those portions of the servo writer which are new are shown in the figures, it being understood that the other portions of the servo writer, such as the unwind section, read/write head, and cleaning process are not shown as they are well known in the art. A portion of the rewind section of the servo writer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is shown in the figures. A take-up reel <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> has a hub <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> which has a fixed point of rotation and is suitably mounted to the member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The reel <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is driven by suitable means (not shown) well known in the art. The hub <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> has a plurality of wraps of a tape media to form a tape pancake <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> that is wound around the hub <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the take-up reel <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. A linear slide <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is mounted to the member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the servo writer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and is fixed in position. A rewind assembly plate <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is slidably mounted on the slide <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, by means well known in the art. Typically, air cylinders are secured at the holes <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to provide for linear motion along the linear slide <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Two idler guides <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are rotatably mounted to the rewind plate assembly <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. A pack wheel <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is mounted on the rewind assembly plate <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. As the tape pancake <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> grows or decreases in size, the rewind assembly plate <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is moved to keep the pack wheel <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> in contact with the tape pancake <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. An arm <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is pivotally mounted about a post <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, which is mounted in the rewind plate assembly <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. A second post <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is mounted to the other end of the arm <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the bore <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the hub section <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is positioned over the second post <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to rotatably mount the winding flange guide <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. A tension spring <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> has a first end operatively connected to the arm <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and a second end to a mounting block <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, which is in turn mounted on the rewind plate assembly <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The mounting block <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may have slots <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>formed therein. Screws <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> are used to secure the mounting block <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in position. By movement along the slot <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the tension of the spring <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> may be easily adjusted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The tension of the spring <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> causes the hub section <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to ride on the outer wrap of the tape pancake <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. The embodiment, as shown in the figures, has a rotatable winding flange guide <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. However, it is appreciated that the guide <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> would not have to pivot if the guide <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> could be moved laterally as the tape pancake <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> grew or decreased in size. The guide <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> would still need to rotate to reduce relative motion between the tape pancake and the guide. The movement would be necessary to ensure that the land sections <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>overlie the outer wraps of the tape pancake. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The height of the winding flange guide <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and idler <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are aligned so that the tape media does not have a bend as it is being wrapped to form the tape pancake <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Further, it is preferred that the flange guide <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> does not contact the tape pancake until after the media has been wrapped on the tape pancake <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. That is, the hub <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> contacts that the tape pancake <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> after the point of tangency. This point of tangency is seen in more detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. While the tape media <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 through 5</cross-reference>, it is understood that it is in the same general configuration as that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> where it will be discussed in more detail. The tape media <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> forms the tape pancake <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the point of tangency is where the tape media <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> contacts the tape pancake <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. By contacting at or after the point of tangency, the pancake <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> has been wrapped before it is guided by the winding flange guide <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is a schematic representation of another embodiment of the present invention wherein the pack wheel <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is spaced at an equal distance from the normal line <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the pancake <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. By being spaced at an equal distance, there would be uniform movement of the pack wheel <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and guide <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as the tape pancake <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> grows or decreases in size. The media <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> still contacts the tape pancake <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> before the guide <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> A typical speed of a servo writer using a standard pack wheel is approximately 8 meters per second. The quality of the wind of a tape media may vary from 200 to 750 RA. The 200 RA would be a relatively good winding whereas 750 RA would represent a poor winding. By utilizing the guide <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention, the wind quality will be in the range of 20 to 30 RA and would be able to do so with speeds up to 16 meters per second or even faster. The winding flange guide <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, with or without a pack wheel, improves the tape wind quality. The flanges <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> constrain the floating wraps of a tape pancake <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> as it is being wound until the air between the wraps can either be forced out by a pack wheel or by the tension of the tape itself. The ability of the most recently wound wraps on a tape pancake <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> to move on entrapped layers of air results in an undesirable scatter winds and popped strands. By constraining these wraps until asperity to asperity contact between tape layers is achieved and the layers are locked into place, these problems can be avoided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> show the winding flange guide <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention utilizing a tape cartridge, generally designated at <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The tape cartridge <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is shown with the cover removed. Further, the tape cartridge <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> illustrates the utilization of the winding flange guide <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and is a representative tape cartridge, as the present invention may be utilized in any suitable cartridge. The tape cartridge <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> includes a first reel <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and a second reel <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> both rotatably mounted on a base <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. Sidewalls <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are operatively connected to the base <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> by means well known in the art and form a window <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>through which the tape media <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> may be accessed. The drive for the reels <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is not shown but may be any drive mechanism well known in the art. An idler guide <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is positioned on each side of the window <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to guide the tape media <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>. The figures show a first tape pancake <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> which is smaller than the hub of the first reel <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and a second tape pancake <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> which is larger than the hub of the second tape reel <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. In other embodiments, the hub can be larger for both reels. The size of the tape pancakes <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> will increase or decrease depending upon the direction in which the reels <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are driven. An arm <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> has a first end pivotally mounted on a post <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> which is secured to the base <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. Another post <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is operatively connected to the other end of the arm <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and is positioned inside of the bore <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the hub section <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the winding flange guide <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The arm <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> includes a top member <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a bottom member <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>the post <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> being captured between the members <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. A spring <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> has a first end secured to a post <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> which is secured to the base <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. A second end of the spring <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> is secured to the arm <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> thereby providing a biasing force to engage the guide <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> against the tape pancake <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. Another guide <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is similarly mounted adjacent a second reel <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 11</cross-reference> illustrate the guide <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> engaging the tape pancake <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, as the tape pancake <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is smaller than the size of the hub of the reel <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 12</cross-reference> show an enlarged view of the guide <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> engaging the second tape pancake <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> which is larger than the reel <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 11</cross-reference>, a portion of the top flange <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the hub of the reel <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> have been removed for clarity. It can be seen that the winding flange guide <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will fit inside of the hub of the reel <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, especially, it can be seen how the outer wraps of the tape pancake <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> is between the lands <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the flanges <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, it can be seen more clearly that the winding flange guide <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> contacts the pancake at or after the point of tangency <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> of the tape pancake <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight>. By having the winding flange guide <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> contact the tape pancake <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> after the point of tangency <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight>, the pancake <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> is wrapped before it is guided by the winding flange guide <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and there is no wrapping that takes place at the winding flange guide <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> show the winding flange guide <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> utilized in a single reel tape cartridge, generally designated at <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The tape cartridge <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> includes a single reel <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> housing a tape pancake <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> formed by the tape media <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. Portions of the hub of the reel <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and of the flange <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> have been removed. The tape cartridge <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> includes a base <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and is suitably connected to side member <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. The side member <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> form a window <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>as is well known in the art. The cover for the tape cartridge <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is not shown. A tape leader is attached to the end of the media <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and also is not shown, it being well known in the art. The winding flange guide <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is pivotally mounted on a post <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. The post <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is operatively connected to the base <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>.

The post <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is captured between an upper arm <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> and a lower arm <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. Similar to the tape cartridge <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, a spring <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> provides a biasing force to bring the guide <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in contact with the tape pancake <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> shows an enlarged view of the contact of the guide <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with the tape pancake <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. It can be seen that the media <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> is being wound to form the tape pancake <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. The hub section <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> contacts the tape pancake <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> past the point of tangency <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> that the tape media <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> forms with the tape pancake <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Again, the wrapping of the tape pancake <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> takes place prior to the contact of the winding flange guide <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> shows the plurality of wraps of the media <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> on the tape pancake being constrained between the lands of the tape guide, it being known that the top land has been broken away. </paragraph>

The tape drive <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> has a housing <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, having an opening <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>through which the tape cartridge <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is inserted. The tape drive wheel <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is driven from below by means well known in the art (not shown). Similarly, the cartridge <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> will typically have sprockets (not shown) well known in the art for driving the cartridge <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. A read/write head <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> is shown positioned inside of the tape drive <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, the construction of which is well known in the art. The tape drive <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, described thus far, is well known in the art and may be any typical tape drive. The use of the winding flange guide <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the tape drive <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is new, in comparison to the prior art, and only this feature will be described in more detail. A post <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is mounted in the housing <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and pivotally mounts an arm <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> having a top member <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a bottom member <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The winding flange guide <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is operatively mounted on a post the same as previously described in prior embodiments of the present invention and is not described in more detail. The spring <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> provides a biasing force to hold the hub <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> against the tape pancake <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>.
