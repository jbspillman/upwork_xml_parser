<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to the field of projection televisions (PTV), and more particularly to a system for mounting infrared receivers in a PTV. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> When an infrared (IR) remote control device is used with a rear projection television (PTV) set, a receiving IR device is typically mounted either on an area of a front panel near the edge of a focusing lens assembly, or at the bottom of a reflecting mirror. The selection of a specific location is made to provide a line-of-sight path from the IR receiver to a viewer&apos;s controlling device. However, to preserve controller battery life, the transmission path is minimized, thereby providing a sufficiently strong received signal for a given transmitted power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Disadvantageously, such an arrangement occupies front panel surface area. This forces a chassis size to be larger than necessary to accommodate the IR receiver sensing element in a typically esthetically-pleasing arrangement within the overall PTV enclosure. To compensate for this impact on chassis size, the target area of the receiving sensor is typically reduced, thereby reducing the received signal power. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A rear projection television (PTV) system employing a reflecting mirror for redirecting an image to be projected, wherein the mirror is fabricated with a coating material having dual light properties according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. With the dual properties comprising a high reflectivity property to incident visible light beams (wavelengths&lt;790 nm) and a transparency property to IR light beams (wavelengths&gt;790 nm), an IR receiver element can be positioned behind the mirror rather than on a front panel of the PTV. In addition, a fresnel lens used for focusing the created image can also concentrate the incident IR beam to provide for a stronger received IR signal than would otherwise be possible.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a conventional rear projection television (PTV) system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having a lighted image source <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, such as a cathode ray tube (CRT), that directs a visible light beam to a planar mirror <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, where the beam is redirected to a target plane either on a focusing fresnel lens <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> or onto a display screen (not shown). Typically, such a system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has an infrared (IR) remote control apparatus consisting of a remote user interface device <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> having an IR transmitter in communication with an IR receiving device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. IR receiving device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is typically located on a front surface of a chassis of a rear PVT apparatus <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, to ensure a maximum strength line-of-sight signal at a sensor of IR receiving device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Alternative mounting locations for IR receiving device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in a rear PTV apparatus <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can also be inside the chassis at a location <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> where the IR signal can be reflected to an IR receiving device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>by planar mirror <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. While such a redirected IR configuration presents a longer signal path, and thus a weaker IR signal, than a front panel mounting arrangement, it has an added advantage in that the chassis does not require external esthetic modification to accept IR receiving device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. A primary design consideration is the ability to provide a strong enough IR signal at IR receiving device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> when remote interface device <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is not directly in front of the PTV apparatus <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Since an angle of incidence on planar mirror <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> will be the angle of reflection, the reflected beam will not typically align the center of an IR beam onto IR receiving device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, further degrading the ultimate received IR signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a PTV system <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> indicating an exemplary location for a infrared (IR) receiver <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. By modifying the coating of a planar mirror <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, an IR wavelength beam <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> from remote interface device <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can pass through the planar mirror <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, while a visible wavelength beam <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> from the CRT <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be reflected to a target plane or fresnel lens <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Such a semi-reflecting planar mirror <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> allows IR receiving device <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to be positioned and mounted behind planar mirror <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Thus, an IR beam received at IR receiving device <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> would be independent of an incident transmission angle, since all incoming IR beams will have a direct line-of-sight path to IR receiving device <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> IR receiving device <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> can be mounted in a variety of ways behind planar mirror <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and, since no particular esthetic considerations are required, a significant reduction in parts count, assembly time, and cost can be realized. An exemplary mounting arrangement could be a molded plastic frame secured to chassis frame of the PTV apparatus <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The reflective coating of planar mirror <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> would preferably have a spectral transmission/absorption characteristic that provides 1) a high reflectivity surface to light wavelengths below an exemplary wavelength &lgr; of 790 nanometers (nm) and 2) a transparent medium for infrared wavelengths above that exemplary 790 nm wavelength. For example, below 790 nm the reflectivity could be approximately 90% and the transmission approximately 10%, whereas above 790 nm the reflectivity could be approximately 15% and the transmission approximately 85%. Such a mirror is known in the art as a &ldquo;cold mirror.&rdquo; Alternative wavelengths can be used as the partition between the visible light and the communications IR link, for example, 600 nm, 900 nm, or 1200 nm wavelengths. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Fabrication of such a cold mirror consists of coating a generally transparent material, such as glass or plastic, said coating being deposited on at least one of the major planar surfaces, said coating further consisting of a material which is one or more compounds from the exemplary group consisting of titanium oxide, silicon dioxide and tantulum oxide. The finished semi-reflective planar element would be positioned in the light path between the lighted image source <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the target plane as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> An added benefit of having fresnel lens <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> serving as the target plane for visible light beam <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and in the radiation path for IR signal <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, is that fresnel lens <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> would also concentrate incoming IR beam <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. This concentration increases the energy density at IR receiving element <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, thus, allowing for lower energy usage. Further, since visible light both from the CRT and other external light sources includes some IR radiation, baffles may be used to minimize any degradation effects of such unwanted beams. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a plot <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the reflectivity vs. a wavelength of an incident light beam for a conventional mirror. Dotted line <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> represents a wavelength of 790 nm, which will be an exemplary partition point for <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>. A natural attenuation of the plot occurs above 1200 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows a plot <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the reflectivity vs. a wavelength of an incident light beam for a mirror coated according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. A clear demarcation begins a roll-off at point <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, so that the reflectivity of the planar element of the present invention is essentially eliminated for wavelengths above 790 nm at point <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a plot of the transmissivity of the mirror of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> vs. wavelength for an incident beam of light. The practical effect is to merge the plot shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> with the plot shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, yielding a generally gaussian curve centered on a wavelength of 1000 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Numerous modifications to and alternative embodiments of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art in view of the foregoing description. Accordingly, this description is to be construed as illustrative only and is for the purpose of teaching those skilled in the art the best mode of carrying out the invention. Details of the embodiments may be varied without departing from the spirit of the invention, and the exclusive use of all modifications which come within the scope of the appended claims is reserved. </paragraph>
