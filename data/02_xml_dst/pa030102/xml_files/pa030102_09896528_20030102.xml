<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> Increasing attention is being given to monitoring the pressure of tires on a vehicle while the vehicle is in motion. A typical tire pressure monitor includes a plurality of transmitter circuits coupled to each of a plurality of tires on a vehicle, each transmitter circuit including a tire pressure sensor inserted into the tire and a radio frequency transmitter. The transmitter circuits sense tire pressure and generate radio frequency signals in the form of a message, the message including a tire identification number and the sensed tire pressure. The tire pressure monitor also includes a receiver circuit coupled to the vehicle for receiving the radio frequency signals. The receiver circuit processes the signals by, for example, displaying the tire pressures of each tire, providing warnings when the tire pressures are outside predetermined parameters, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> One challenge in tire pressure monitoring is identifying the location of the tires on the vehicle (e.g., left front, left rear, right rear, etc.). As tires are changed or rotated, the tire locations must be updated. In order to display the proper tire pressure to the driver for each tire, the locations of the tires must be known. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> According to one prior system, signals coming via various reception antennas are processed not individually but rather together, and evaluated as to signal intensity for purposes of allocation to a specific wheel. The signals are summed, and the intensity of the summed signal is determined and compared to the intensity of a summed signal constituted by temporarily switching only N-1 reception antennas to the input of the receiver. The disconnected reception antenna is changed cyclically. According to the teachings of this system, the antenna whose deactivation results in the greatest intensity loss in the summed signal is normally that antenna which is located closest to the transmitting wheel electronics package, and thus receives the signal with the greatest field strength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> One drawback of this system is that some signals may be received with a higher signal strength at a reception antenna which is not closest to the position of the transmitting wheel, due to multipath, interference caused by spinning tires and surrounding objects, and other disturbances. This can lead to inaccurate results, which is disadvantageous in a system where it is very important to avoid providing misleading tire pressure data to the operator. Furthermore, this; system requires multiple reception antennas, and, therefore, cannot be used with a tire pressure monitoring system having only one antenna. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, what is needed is an accurate system and method for identifying tire position that does not require manual programming. Further, what is needed is a system and method usable on tire monitoring systems having one antenna or a plurality of antennas. Further still, what is needed is a system and method for passively identifying tire position that is more accurate and reliable than prior systems. Further yet, what is needed is a system that can detect tire position universally, i.e., without the need for a specialized transmission protocol. The teachings hereinbelow extend to those embodiments which fall within the scope of the appended claims, regardless of whether they accomplish one or more of the above-mentioned needs. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS </heading>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Referring first to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> tire monitoring system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is illustrated on a vehicle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Tire monitoring system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is configured to monitor one or more characteristics of one or more tires <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, such as, tire pressure, temperature, alignment, tread wear, etc. Tire monitoring system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is a wireless system, which utilizes radio frequency, infrared, or other wireless signal transmission technology to provide tire characteristic data from tires <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to a tire monitor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Thus, tire monitoring system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of tire sensors <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, each coupled to one of tires <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Tire sensors <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are configured to sense one or more characteristics of tires <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, respectively, and to provide tire characteristic data wirelessly to tire monitor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Tire monitor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> includes a single antenna <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in this exemplary embodiment for receiving wireless messages from one or more of tire sensors <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In alternative embodiments, multiple antennas may be coupled to tire monitor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> for receiving wireless messages at a plurality of locations on vehicle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. For example, tire monitor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may include four antennas, one disposed in the vicinity of each of tire sensors <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Tire monitor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is configured to receive wireless messages from one or more of tire sensors <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, to monitor the tire characteristic data on the wireless messages, and to selectively display tire characteristic data to an operator of vehicle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. For example, tire monitor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may receive tire pressure data from tire sensors <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and may monitor the tire pressure data to determine if the tire pressure of any of tires <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is greater than or less than predetermined maximum and/or minimum thresholds and may provide a display and associated alarm (visible, audible, etc.) to the operator of vehicle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The alarm indicates to the operator that maintenance of the tire causing the alarm may be needed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Each of tire sensors <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is configured to transmit tire identification data, which may be any type of message uniquely identifying the tire. For example, a tire identification of &ldquo;000f&rdquo;, in hexadecimal representation, may indicate a first tire, while a tire identification of &ldquo;01af&rdquo; may identify a different tire. Tire monitor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is configured to receive the tire identification data on the wireless message and to identify a location of the tire on vehicle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, to provide more meaningful tire data to the operator of vehicle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. For example, tire monitor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may associate a tire identification of &ldquo;000f&rdquo; with the vehicle position of &ldquo;left front&rdquo;, and display the tire pressure data associated with tire &ldquo;000f&rdquo; along with a display indicating that the tire is the left front tire, such as, &ldquo;LF <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>&rdquo;. In this manner, useful information can be provided to the operator of vehicle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to determine alarm conditions, such as, &ldquo;LF LOW&rdquo;, &ldquo;RR LOW&rdquo;, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> block diagram of tire monitor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is illustrated according to an exemplary embodiment. Tire monitor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> includes a receiver circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, a signal strength circuit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, a processing circuit <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, and a memory <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Circuits <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and memory <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are illustrated in block form to indicate that these elements are functional units which may be embodied in hardware circuitry, software, or other processing elements. For example, circuits <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and memory <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be disposed on one or more integrated circuits, and may be part of a system-on-chip (SOC), and may further include programmable logic, microprocessors, microcontrollers, or other control circuitry. Furthermore, memory <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may include volatile memory portions and non-volatile memory portions, and may include random access memory, read-only memory, and other memory types. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Receiver circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is configured to receive wireless messages via antenna <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> from tire sensors <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Portions of receiver circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may be duplicated to receive wireless messages from a plurality of antennas simultaneously. Tire sensors <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are configured to transmit blocks of wireless messages, each block including eight identical frames of data, in this exemplary embodiment. Due to interference, multipath, and other sources of error, tire sensors <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> send duplicative data in each of the frames of each block. Tire sensors <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are configured to transmit blocks of data periodically, wherein the rate of transmissions is greater when the vehicle is in motion than when the vehicle is idle. For example, when the vehicle is in motion, a block of data may be sent from each of tire sensors <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> at a rate of one transmission per <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> seconds, and when vehicle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is idle, tire sensors <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are each configured to send a block of data at a rate of one transmission per 60 minutes. Receiver circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may include amplifying circuitry, filtering circuitry, buffering circuitry, demodulating circuitry, and/or other circuit elements necessary to receive wireless messages from tire sensors <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> via antenna <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Signal strength circuit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is coupled to receiver circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and is configured to determine the signal strengths of the wireless messages. In this exemplary embodiment, signal strength circuit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> generates a received signal strength indicator (RSSI) for each frame of each block of data. In particular, the RSSI of the first bit in each frame of each block is used to determine the RSSI for the frame. If additional signal strength values are required, signal strength circuit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may be configured to measure a plurality of signal strength values for each frame. Signal strength circuit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may measure signal strength values for one or more of the first bit of each frame, the last bit of each frame, or any other bits in the frame or message. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Signal strength circuit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> uses RSSI in this exemplary embodiment, but may alternatively use other measures of signal strength. RSSI is calculated in this exemplary embodiment by demodulating the selected bit or bits of the frame or message. The demodulated bit or bits are associated with an RF power (i.e., signal strength), and are digitized with an analog-to-digital (A/D) converter. The output of the A/D converter provides the RSSI counts of the sample. RSSI may be generated for either frequency-modulated (FM) or amplitude-modulated (AM) signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Processing circuit <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is configured to store the signal strengths provided by signal strength circuit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in memory <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Processing circuit <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is configured to identify the positions of the tires on vehicle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (e.g., left front, right front, right rear, left rear) based on the signal strengths of the wireless messages. In one exemplary embodiment, processing circuit <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is configured to provide a pattern of the signal strengths (e.g., a statistical distribution such as, a frequency distribution), to compare the pattern of the signal strengths to one or more predetermined patterns (e.g., frequency distributions) stored in memory <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and to determine the position of the tire on the vehicle based on the comparison. The frequency distributions may include one or more counts of signal strengths that provide sufficient data to correlate a new frequency distribution with one of a plurality of stored frequency distributions. In this example, frequency distributions include the number of samples per bin. This advantageous feature of this exemplary embodiment will now be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> histogram <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> illustrating the frequency distribution stored by processing circuit <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and memory <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is illustrated. In this simplified example, only eight signal strength samples; are illustrated, but in alternative embodiments, the accuracy of tire monitor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be improved by providing a frequency distribution having sample sizes of tens, hundreds, or thousands of signal strength samples. Each of the signal strength samples provided in histogram <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is associated with the same tire identification data. In this exemplary embodiment, processing circuit <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is configured to generate a frequency distribution or count pattern by sorting the received messages by signal strength value into bins of 2 RSSI counts ranging from approximately 60 counts to 180 counts. Each of bins <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> includes a count (represented by bars <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> in histogram <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>) of signal strength values falling within the range of the bin values. The resulting frequency distribution <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> or pattern provides an indication of the tire position on the vehicle, since the signal strengths of the messages are affected by the positions of tire sensors <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> relative to antenna <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of tire monitor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). The distance, angle, and any interfering objects, such as, the vehicle frame, etc. affect the frequency distribution for each tire position. Also, various conductive shielding shapes can be implemented in or around tires <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (e.g., in the wheel wells) to create desired or unique frequency distribution patterns at each of tires <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Once a predetermined number of signal strength samples have been acquired by processing circuit <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> (e.g., as a number of samples, a number of samples per wavelength of the wireless message, etc.), or if signal strengths have been acquired for a predetermined period of time, processing circuit <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> compares pattern <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> to one or more predetermined frequency distributions or patterns <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> to determine the position of the tire in the vehicle. Predetermined patterns <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are stored in memory <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, for example, during manufacture of vehicle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Predetermined patterns <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> may be generated based on a testing phase during manufacture, and may subsequently be updated during the life of vehicle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Each of patterns <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> represents a typical pattern of signal strength samples of wireless messages received from the left front vehicle location (pattern <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>), the left rear vehicle location (pattern <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>), the right front vehicle location (pattern <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>), and the right rear vehicle location (pattern <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In comparing pattern <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> to predetermined patterns <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, processing circuit <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> may compare one characteristic of the patterns or may compare multiple characteristics of the patterns. These characteristics may include: mean, variance, the count or bin range from the largest count or bin to the smallest count or bin, position of mode or highest peak, position of mode relative to minimum, maximum, or mean, squared difference of each bar between pattern <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> (i.e., an incoming pattern) and each of predetermined patterns <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> to find the predetermined pattern having least squared difference from the incoming pattern, etc. Other characteristics may be compared to determine the best match between pattern <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and patterns <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. In this exemplary embodiment, pattern <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> most closely corresponds to pattern <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, processing circuit <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> determines that the position of the tire identified by the wireless messages in pattern <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is the right front tire. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, tire monitor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> does not require a specialized protocol to identify the position of the tires. The frequency distribution patterns can be improved by increasing the number of bins, decreasing the size of the bins, or increasing the number of signal strength samples in each frequency distribution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, processing circuit <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is configured to communicate with a display <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and an operator input device <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Processing circuit <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> may be configured to generate display signals for display of tire characteristic data along with the position of the tire associated with the tire characteristic data on display <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Operator input device <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, which may include a button, switch, touch screen, voice recognition device, etc. may be used by the operator to select characteristic data to be displayed from memory <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> via processing circuit <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Operator input device <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> may further be used to calibrate tire monitor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> initially, as will be described in exemplary form in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> hereinbelow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary application, when a new tire is provided to vehicle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, or tires <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> have been rotated, processing circuit <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is configured to automatically detect the change and adjust the display of tire characteristics accordingly. Processing circuit <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> receives signal strengths of wireless messages from each of the tires in their new positions. Processing circuit <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is configured to provide frequency distributions for each of tire sensors <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> associated with tires <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, based on the tire identification data within the wireless messages. Processing circuit <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is further configured to compare each new frequency distribution to the predetermined patterns stored in memory <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to determine the new positions of the tire or tires that have changed position, or the new tire. Processing circuit <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is then configured to store the new tire positions in memory <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and/or provide the new tire positions on display <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, an exemplary method of identifying the position of a tire in a vehicle will now be described. It is understood that one or more of the steps in this exemplary method may be eliminated or rearranged in various embodiments. At step <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, initial signal strength patterns are stored in memory <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of tire monitor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. As mentioned, the initial or predetermined signal strength patterns may be provided by testing of the vehicle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> during manufacture. Alternatively, the purchaser of a new vehicle or the purchaser of a new tire monitoring system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may user operator input device <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> to provide an initial calibration procedure to train tire monitor to store the predetermined signal strength patterns in memory <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. For example, tire monitor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may display a tire identification on display <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, and the operator may input the tire position associated with that tire identification using operator input device <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, wherein the tire identification can be read from a label affixed to tire sensors <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> on their associated tires. Various other techniques are contemplated for storing initial signal strength patterns in step <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, including updating the stored signal strength patterns during the lifetime of the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, after calibration or training in step <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, tire monitor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> enters an operation phase during which wireless messages are received from transmitters associated with tire sensors <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. At step <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, the signal strengths of the wireless messages are determined, for example, using RSSI techniques and signal strength circuit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. At step <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, processing circuit <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is configured to provide a frequency distribution or pattern of signal strength samples, for example, by saving the incoming signal strengths in memory <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> When a sufficient number of signal strength samples have been received for a given tire identification, or when a predetermined period of time has passed between prior comparison steps, such as step <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, the frequency distribution for one or more of tire sensors <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is compared with signal strength samples stored in step <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. One or more characteristics of the frequency distributions may be compared in step <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. In step <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, the position of the tire having the tire identification of the frequency distribution compared in step <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is identified. At step <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, if a change in position is detected, the new position is stored at step <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> in memory <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> for the given tire identification. Optionally, the operator may receive an indication on display <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> that a new position for a tire ID has been identified, either in textual indication, audible indication, via a light-emitting diode or via a graphical or pictorial image (e.g., an icon). The method returns to step <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> to repeat the process for additional incoming wireless messages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, this exemplary method does not require manual intervention to identify tire positions, since tire monitor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> automatically receives and processes wireless messages from tire sensors <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> While the exemplary embodiments illustrated in the FIGURES and described above are presently preferred, it should be understood that these embodiments are offered by way of example only. For example, various patterns of signal strength values may be compared to identify tire positions, other than or in addition to frequency distributions. Further, the teachings herein may be applied to various types of vehicles, including cars, trucks, all-terrain vehicles, construction vehicles, etc. Accordingly, the present invention is not limited to a particular embodiment, but extends to various modifications that nevertheless fall within the scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
