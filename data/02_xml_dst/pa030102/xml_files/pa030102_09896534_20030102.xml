<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The present invention relates generally to the reduction of odd harmonics of phase angle controlled loads. One embodiment relates to an apparatus for reducing odd harmonic currents introduced into an alternating current (AC) supply by a load having a zero crossing detector and a processor coupled to the zero crossing detector. The zero crossing detector is coupled to the AC current supply for measuring voltage zero crossings of the AC current supply. The processor receives a user control signal for controlling the load, such as, for example, a speed control, determines phase angles required at the voltage zero crossings of the AC current supply to implement the user control signal, and selectively modulating the phase angles when they are in a predetermined range of undesired phase angles in order to selectively reduce odd harmonics within the AC current supply. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Phase angle control may be used to control different types of AC loads. Phase angle control is a method of controlling the effective average voltage applied to a load by using an electronic switch and varying the conduction angle. Because the current waveform driving the loads are generally not sinusoidal waveforms, harmonic currents are introduced which causes distortion in the voltage waveforms. This distortion can also affect other loads that are coupled to the same power supply. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Active power correction circuitry used to reduce harmonics is often used in computer switchmode power supplies and some lighting applications. One known active power correction circuitry uses a boost power supply with a power MOSFET as the switching device. The power MOSFET controls the current flowing to the output. While the power MOSFET is applicable for low-power applications, it becomes prohibitively expensive above 1,000 Watts. Other switching devices that may be used in place of the power MOSFET, such as, for example, IGBTs (Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors), have limited switching frequencies thus increasing the cost of other components within the power correction circuitry, such as boost inductors. Therefore, a need exists for effective phase angle control system that is capable of reducing harmonics while being able to handle higher power loads.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates in block diagram form, a harmonics reduction system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. System <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a processor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a speed control unit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a triac drive unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, a memory <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, a zero crossing unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, a triac <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and a load <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Processor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is coupled to speed control unit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (via conductor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>), triac drive unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (via conductor <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>), zero crossing unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> (via conductor <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>), and memory <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Processor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be a microprocessor (MPU), microcontroller (MCU), a digital signal processor (DSP), a data processing system, or any other type of processor. Memory <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> may be an embedded memory within processor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, or may include one or more external memory units. Memory <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> may be any appropriate type of memory, such as, for example, Flash, EEPROM, EPROM, ROM, RAM, MRAM, etc. Triac drive unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is coupled to triac <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (via conductor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>), where triac <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> receives the neutral input from an alternating current (AC) power supply (not shown) and is coupled to load <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. (Note that in place of triac <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, any thyristor may be used.) Load <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is coupled to zero crossing unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and receives the line input from the AC power supply. Zero crossing unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> also receives the line input. Therefore, the neutral and line inputs may correspond to an input power supply applied to load <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, such as, for example, a wall socket or other AC power supply, where the line input is the live input ideally having a sinusoidal waveform. However, due to loading of the AC power supply, the sinusoidal waveform is usually distorted, thus resulting in a non-sinusoidal AC power supply. Thus, the line input to load <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be non-sinusoidal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In operation, system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> provides phase angle control and reduces odd harmonics introduced by load <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Load <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be any phase controlled load, such as, for example, a universal motor. System <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may therefore be used in many appliances such as vacuum cleaners, light dimmers, heaters, power tools, washing machines, etc. Therefore, system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> identifies particular phase angles where the harmonic current is above predetermined limits and applies an algorithm to strategically avoid them. For example, the predetermined limits on harmonic currents may be those mandated by government regulations, as will be discussed in reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> below. Excessive harmonic currents causes many undesirable effects, such as, for example, introducing distortions into the voltage waveform, which may affect any other loads (e.g. appliances, etc.) coupled to the same power supply. Therefore, system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> reduces noise, such as harmonic currents, in order to maintain power quality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Speed control <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> provides a speed value (i.e. also referred to as a speed control signal) to processor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, via conductor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, indicative of a speed setting. (For example, in one embodiment, speed control <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be a knob on a motor that allows a user to select the desired motor speed.) This speed value corresponds to a desired phase angle to be applied to load <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Processor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> receives this speed value and determines the resulting output phase angle (also referred to as output firing phasing angle) that must be applied to triac <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> via triac drive unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for proper control of load <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. (The details of determining the output phase angle will be discussed below in reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>.) Triac drive unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> therefore applies a triggering current (also referred to as a load control signal) via conductor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to triac <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> such that triac <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> latches at the proper firing phase angle (corresponding to the output firing phase angle calculated by processor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) and couples the neutral input to load <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. For example, if the output firing phase angle (derived from the input desired phase angle) is 60 degrees, triac drive unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> applies the triggering current such that triac <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> latches at 60 degrees before the next voltage zero crossing of the line input. Upon the line input voltage crossing the zero axis, triac <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is released, thus decoupling the neutral input from load <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Zero crossing unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> therefore provides a voltage zero crossing indicator to processor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> when the line input voltage crosses the zero axis. Therefore, the firing phase angle of triac <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> refers to the number of degrees before the voltage zero crossing of the line input where triac <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> latches. Processor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> uses the speed value received from speed control <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the zero crossing indicator received from zero crossing unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and instructions stored within memory <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> to reduce harmonic currents, as will be discussed in more detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates, in table form, the standards for power quality in Europe as defined in EN61000-3-2. This standard has been adopted by the European Community and is a requirement for CE approval. Therefore, this is one example of limits placed on harmonic currents; however, system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may target any predetermined limit on harmonic currents, as appropriate. As see in table <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, various limits are given on each harmonic current, both even and odd. The harmonic current limit (i.e. maximum harmonic current) for an odd harmonic falling between 15 and 39, inclusively, can be calculated by dividing the odd harmonic number into 15 and multiplying the result by 0.15. Similarly, the harmonic current limit (i.e. maximum harmonic current) for an even harmonic falling between 8 and 40, inclusively, can be calculated by dividing the even harmonic number into 8 and multiplying the result by 0.23. Note that the limit (maximum harmonic current) on the third harmonic according to the European standard is 2.3 Amps. Generally, the third harmonic current for phase angle controlled applications is problematic and can detrimentally distort the power quality. Therefore, system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> can be used to ensure that the third harmonic current does not surpass 2.3 Amps. Although the third harmonic will be used as an example herein, the embodiments described herein may be used to reduce any odd harmonics within system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and is not limited to the third harmonic. Likewise, the European standard defines the limit on the third harmonic current as 2.3 Amps; however, any predetermined limit may be set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates, in graph form, the harmonic current corresponding to the third harmonic of an AC power supply. Graph <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> graphs one example of a third harmonic current with respect to the firing phase angle of triac <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Note that in this example, the third harmonic current surpasses its 2.3 Amps limit between the firing phase angles of 60 and 120 degrees (corresponding to points <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, respectively). Therefore, this range is identified as problematic or undesirable where the harmonic current should be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates, in block diagram form, one embodiment of a portion of processor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Processor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> includes an A/D (analog to digital) converter <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, scaling unit <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, summers <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, delay unit <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, transfer function <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and timer and pulse generator <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. A/D converter <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> receives the speed value via conductor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> from speed control <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and is coupled to scaling unit <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Scaling unit <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> provides the desired input phase angle (X) to summer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Summer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is coupled to delay unit <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> which is coupled to summer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Summer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> provides an error modified desired phase angle (Z) to summer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and transfer function <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Transfer function <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> provides the output phase angle (Y) to summer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and timer and pulse generator <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. Timer and pulse generator <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> also receives the zero crossing indicator from zero crossing unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> via conductor <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, and provides an output to triac drive unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> via conductor <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In operation, A/D converter <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> receives the speed value from speed control <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and converts it to a digital value. In one embodiment, speed control <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is a potentiometer capable of providing a variety of speed values to A/D converter <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Scaling unit <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> receives the digital value from A/D converter <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and scales it to fall into a predetermined range. For example, in one embodiment, scaling unit <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> scales the digital values received from A/D converter <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to values between 0 and 180 such that they correspond directly to a desired input phase angle received from speed control unit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Therefore, a particular setting on speed control <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is converted to a desired phase angle (X) that will result in the desired speed of load <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which in one embodiment, may be a universal motor. (Note that although speed control is being used as an example, other loads may have other variable phase angle controls other than speed, such as brightness control for incandescent lights, temperature control for heaters, etc.) Summers <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, delay unit <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, and transfer function <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> operate to modulate X into an output phase angle (Y) where Y corresponds to the firing phase angle of triac <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Summer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> receives X and an error (i.e. an error phase) calculated from a previous half cycle (calculated by summer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and provided to delay unit <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> such that the error is held from a previous half cycle to a subsequent half cycle) and provides the error modified desired phase angle (Z) to transfer function <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Transfer function <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is further defined in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> which illustrates, in graph form, the translation of the error modified desired phase angle (Z) received from summer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to the output Y. For example, if Z is between 0 and 60 degrees, inclusively, or between 120 and 180 degrees, inclusively, Y remains the same as Z (e.g. Y&equals;Z). However, if Z is between 60 and 120 degrees, exclusively, then it gets translated down by 60 degrees (i.e. a predetermined correction phase angle) prior to being output as Y (Y&equals;Z&minus;<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>). Operation of summers <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, delay unit <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, and transfer function <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> will be described further in reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 8</cross-reference>. Note that summers <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, delay unit <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, and transfer function <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can be implemented in hardware, software, or in a combination of hardware and software. For example, they can be implemented in software stored in memory <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Timer and pulse generator <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> receives the output firing phase angle (Y) and the zero crossing indicator and provides an indicator via conductor <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to triac drive unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, which applies the triggering current (e.g. a pulse) to triac <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Timer and pulse generator <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> calculates an amount of time to wait from a zero crossing prior to firing triac <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Upon reaching a next zero crossing (indicated via conductor <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>), timer and pulse generator <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> waits for the calculated amount of time prior to indicating to triac drive unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (via conductor <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>) to generate a pulse such that triac <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> fires at the firing phase angle Y. Thus, in this embodiment, the firing phase angle Y calculated in a current half cycle is not applied until the subsequent half cycle. However, in alternate embodiments, the firing phase angle Y may be applied in the current half cycle or any subsequent half cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Operation of summers <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, delay unit <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, and transfer function <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> therefore allows the time average of output phase angle (Y) over two half cycles to be approximately equivalent to the desired (input) phase angle (X). This is illustrated in the example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> where <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> illustrates, in graph form, one example of the operation of processor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> corresponding to the third harmonic current of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> illustrates an AC power supply voltage waveform (the top waveform) having zero crossings at points <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. At the first zero crossing <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, an example is given where the desired input phase angle (X) is calculated to be 61 degrees. The error modified desired phase angle (Z) is therefore also 61 degrees (assuming the error from the previous half cycle was zero degrees). Since Z falls within the problem range of 60 to 120 degrees (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>), 60 degrees is subtracted from Z to produce the output phase angle Y for the subsequent half cycle (see also <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). Therefore, timer and pulse generator <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> receives Y (which is 1 degree in this example) and calculates the amount of time to wait between a zero crossing and firing triac <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> at 1 degree. Upon finishing this calculation, which is generally finished early in the current half cycle (i.e. shortly after zero crossing <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> or at least prior to zero crossing <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>), timer and pulse generator <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> waits for a next zero crossing, zero crossing <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, and then waits the previously calculated amount of time (between point <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and the start of pulse <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>) before causing the triac trigger pulse <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> to fire. Also, at this next zero crossing <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, calculations are initiated for the subsequent half cycle (starting at zero crossing <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>). The error calculated previously (60 degrees) is added to X to obtain Z. The value of Z is now 121 degrees which falls out of the problematic range. Therefore, Y remains the same as Z and the new error (Z minus Y) to be used in the subsequent half cycle (starting at zero crossing <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>) is 0. The calculations completed after zero crossing <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> are then used by timer and pulse generator <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> after zero crossing <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> to provide triggering current pulse <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> at a firing angle of 121 degrees (corresponding to Y). Therefore, it can be seen that the time average of Y ((1&plus;121)/2&equals;61 degrees) is approximately equivalent to X (also 61 degrees). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Alternate embodiments may use a time average over more than two half cycles. For example, the range can be increased from 60 to 120 degrees to 45 to 135 degrees by modulating over a wider range. For example, if the desired phase angle (X) is between 45 and 90 degrees, 45 degrees is subtracted from the output phase angle. If the desired phase angle (X) is between 90 and 135 degrees, 45 degrees is added to the output phase angle. This results average to the desired angle over three half cycles. </paragraph>

Furthermore, the software may be stored in a memory unit, such as, for example, memory <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> for access by processor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates in flow diagram form, a method for reducing odd harmonics according to one embodiment of the present invention that may be used in processor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Flow <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> corresponds to the operation of summer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, delay unit <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, transfer function <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Flow <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> begins at start <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and proceeds to block <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> where the desired input phase angle (X) is received (where X may be derived from the speed value received from speed control <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, as described above). Flow continues to block <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> where an error from a prior iteration is added to X to create an error modified phase angle (Z). (If this is the first iteration, the error is initialized to zero.) Therefore, block <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> may correspond to summer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, where the output of summer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is Z. Flow continues to block <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> where the output phase angle (Y), corresponding to the triac firing phase angle, is set to Z. Then, at decision diamond <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, it is determined whether Y is greater than a predetermined lower limit and less than a predetermined upper limit. These limits correspond to the problem area being avoided. For example, in the case of attempting to reduce the third harmonic current illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the problem area occurs between the firing phase angles of 60 and 120 degrees. Therefore, in this example, the lower limit may be set to 60 and the upper limit set to 120. If Y is greater than the lower limit and less than the upper limit, flow proceeds to block <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> where the difference between the upper and lower limits (i.e. upper limit minus the lower limit, also referred to as the predetermined correction phase angle) is subtracted from Y (thus modifying Y). This may be performed by transfer function <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. In the example of the third harmonic current of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, if Y were between 60 and 120 degrees, exclusively, 60 degrees would be subtracted from Y such that Y would no longer be in the problem range of 60 to 120 degrees. Flow then proceeds to block <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. If, at decision diamond <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, Y is not greater than the lower limit and less than the upper limit, Y remains unmodified, and flow proceeds to block <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> where the error value for the current cycle is set to Z minus Y. This may be performed by summer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. This error will be used in the next iteration through flow <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> (at block <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>). Flow proceeds to block <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> where Y is output for subsequent processing (for example, Y may be provided to timer and pulse generator <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). Flow proceeds to decision diamond <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> where it is determined whether a next zero crossing has been reached. If not, flow returns to decision diamond <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> until a next zero crossing is reached, at which point flow returns to block <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. Therefore, in block <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, the error from the previous iteration is used. As described above, flow <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> reduces the third harmonic current of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and allows the time average of output phase angle (Y) over two half cycles to be approximately equivalent to the desired (input) phase angle (X). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates, in graph form, the results from applying the flow of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. Therefore, flow <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> modulates the desired phase angle (X) such that the output firing phase angle (Y) avoids the problematic range. Therefore, as can be seen in the graph of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, which is similar to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the third harmonic current remains below 2.3 Amps. Therefore, it can be appreciated how processor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and flow <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> can help reduce odd harmonic currents. Although the above description used the third harmonic current with a 2.3 Amp limit as an example, processor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and flow <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> can be modified to take care of any problematic range of firing phase angles for triac <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. For example, the upper and lower limits described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> can be set to define any problematic or undesirable range where different predetermined correction phase angles may be used to adjust the phase angles from falling within the predetermined range. Alternatively, the methods and systems herein may be used for reducing any signal element from a signal within a problematic range, and not just harmonic currents. </paragraph>
