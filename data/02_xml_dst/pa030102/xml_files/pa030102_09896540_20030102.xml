<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to fuel tanks of the type which are used on small engines for lawnmowers, lawn tractors and other outdoor lawn and garden implements, as well as for off-road and sport vehicles. In particular, the present invention relates to a fuel gauge for such fuel tanks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Engines for lawnmowers, lawn tractors, and other outdoor implements include fuel tanks for holding a volume of engine fuel, which fuel tanks are either attached directly to the engine, or are attached to the implement remote from the engine and connected thereto by a fuel line. Sometimes, such fuel tanks include a fuel gauge to allow the operator of the implement to determine the amount of fuel in the fuel tank. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> For Example, one such fuel gauge includes a cylindrically-shaped fuel gauge assembly which fits within a hole in the fuel tank, and is which is sealed within the hole by adhesive, caulk, an O-ring, or a close threaded engagement between the fuel gauge assembly and the hole in the fuel tank. The fuel gauge assembly includes an indicator needle movable between empty and full positions, wherein the indicator needle is moved by a float which rotates a screw member connected to the indicator needle as the position of the float changes in order to move the needle between the empty and full positions responsive to varying fuel levels in the fuel tank. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Problematically, the foregoing fuel gauge assembly, as well as many other types of fuel gauge assemblies, require a hole in the fuel tank within which the fuel gauge assembly is fitted for attachment to the fuel tank. Although such a construction is usually not initially problematic, extended life or extended usage of the implement may give rise to the possibility of deterioration and failure of the connection between the fuel gauge assembly and the hole in the fuel tank, thereby allowing the possibility of fuel leakage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Additionally, known fuel gauge assemblies are sometimes not mounted to the fuel tank in a manner in which they may be easily viewed by an operator during operation of the associated implement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> What is needed is a fuel gauge assembly which is an improvement over the foregoing, and which reduces the possibility of fuel leakage from the fuel tank to which the fuel gauge assembly is attached, and which may be easily viewed by an operator during operation of the associated implement. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a fuel gauge assembly for mounting to the fuel tank of a small engine which is used with a lawnmower, lawn tractor, or other outdoor implement. The fuel gauge assembly generally includes an indicator housing and a float assembly. The indicator housing is mounted exteriorly of the fuel tank to an upper surface thereof, and includes a movable indicator element having either a magnet or a magnetically attractive element. The float assembly includes a support member mounted interiorly of the fuel tank, and further includes an arm movably connected to the support member, the arm including either a magnet or a magnetically attractive element which is disposed adjacent the indicator housing, and a float for sensing a level of fuel within the fuel tank. When the level of fuel in the fuel tank varies, the float changes position such that movement of the arm causes a corresponding movement of the indicator element to indicate the amount of fuel in the fuel tank. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The components of the fuel gauge assembly may be mounted to the wall of the fuel tank in a variety of ways. For example, the indicator housing may be secured to the wall of the fuel tank by an adhesive, such as an adhesive pad, and the wall may include a pair of rivet members extending interiorly within the fuel tank, upon which the support member is mounted, wherein head portions of the rivet members are then deformed to secure the support member to the wall of the fuel tank. Alternatively, the support member may be integrally formed with the wall of the fuel tank. Further, the wall of the fuel tank may include mounting bosses having threaded openings into which fasteners are tapped to secure the indicator housing and the support member to the wall of the fuel tank. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, the present fuel gauge assembly may be mounted to the wall of a fuel tank without the need for any type of hole to be made in the wall of the fuel tank, thereby maintaining the structural integrity of the wall of the fuel tank and preventing the possibility of fuel leakage from the fuel tank through the fuel gauge assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the indicator housing is mounted to an upper surface of the fuel tank, such that the indicator housing and indicator element are easily viewed by an operator of an associated implement with which the fuel gauge assembly us used, such that the operator may easily determine the amount of fuel within the fuel tank during operation of the implement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In one form thereof the present invention provides an internal combustion engine is provided, including an engine housing; a fuel tank connected to the engine housing, the fuel tank having an upper surface; and a fuel gauge assembly associated with the fuel tank, the fuel gauge assembly including an indicator housing connected to the upper surface of the fuel tank exteriorly of the fuel tank, the indicator housing including a moveable indicator element having one of a magnet portion and a magnetically attractive element; and a float assembly, including a support member mounted interiorly to the fuel tank and an arm movably connected to the support member, the arm including a float for sensing a level of fuel within the fuel tank, and the other of the magnet portion and the magnetically attractive element disposed opposite the one of the magnet portion and the magnetically attractive element of the indicator element, wherein when the level of fuel in the fuel tank varies, the float changes position to move the arm, thereby moving the indicator element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In another form thereof, the present invention provides the combination of a fuel tank having an upper surface; and a fuel gauge assembly associated with the fuel tank, including an indicator housing connected to the upper surface of the fuel tank, the indicator housing including a moveable indicator element having one of a magnet portion and a magnetically attractive element; and a float assembly, including a support member mounted interiorly to the fuel tank and an arm movably connected to the support member, the arm including a float for sensing a level of fuel within the fuel tank and the other of the magnet portion and the magnetically attractive element disposed adjacent the one of the magnet portion and the magnetically attractive element of the indicator element, wherein when the level of fuel in the fuel tank varies, the float changes position to move the arm and the indicator element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In a further form thereof, the present invention provides a fuel gauge assembly for mounting to a fuel tank which includes a substantially horizontal upper wall, the fuel gauge assembly including an indicator housing connected to the wall exteriorly of the fuel tank, the indicator housing including a moveable indicator element having one of a magnet portion and a magnetically attractive element; and a float assembly, including a support member mounted to the wall within the fuel tank and an arm movably connected to the support member, the arm including a float for sensing a level of fuel within the fuel tank and the other of the magnet portion and the magnetically attractive element disposed adjacent the one of the magnet portion and the magnetically attractive element of the indicator element, wherein when the level of fuel in the tank varies, the float changes position to move the arm and the indicator element.</paragraph>
