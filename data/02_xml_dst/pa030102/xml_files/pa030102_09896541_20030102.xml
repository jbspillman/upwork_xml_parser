<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to a power measurement means of a mobile station for measuring power of pilot channel signals transmitted from base stations in an asynchronous code division multiple access (CDMA) communication system. More particularly, the present invention relates to a power measurement means of a mobile station for measuring transmission power of each base station using transmission diversity techniques when the mobile station receives pilot channel signals combined with a plurality of spread pilot channel signals that are separately transmitted through antennas of each base station after pilot channel symbols are spread by a scramble code which is allotted for each base station, and a plurality of antenna symbol patterns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A variety of multiple access communication systems have used a single antenna for data transmission between base stations and mobile stations. In these cases, there has developed a critical problem concerning the deterioration of quality of the communication causing damage to several data groups if transmission channels encounter fading. The recited problem has been solved by the use of transmission diversity techniques in which data or information are transferred through at least two antennas. That is, the communication quality of mobile communication systems due to the deleterious effects of fading may have been improved by diversity techniques. In third generation mobile communication systems, transmission diversity techniques whereby base stations transmit the same data through two antennas has been recommended to maximize the capability of data transmission and receiving. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Third generation mobile communication systems suggested by Europe entities (hereinafter, called 3GPP) have also requested that base stations use diversity techniques to maximize the capability of data transmission/receiving. However, a mobile station can not use diversity techniques since it is physically too small to incorporate two antennas. In other words, even if the mobile station incorporates two antennas, the gain of diversity is too small because the distance between the two antennas is too short. Other disadvantages of a mobile station using diversity techniques are the size and manufacturing cost of the mobile station. In view of the above problems, generally base stations have only been able to use diversity techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a mobile communication system in which a mobile station <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> receives signals transmitted from base stations through antennas in the radio mobile communication system. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the mobile station <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may receive signals transmitted from not only base station <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in the cell <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in which the mobile station exists, but also from neighboring base stations <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in cells <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, respectively. Generally, the signal strength transmitted from the neighboring base stations is weaker than that of base station <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in the cell <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in which the mobile station <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> exists. However, as the mobile station approaches the border of the neighboring base stations <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in cells <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the weaker the signal strength transmitted from base station <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in the cell <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> where the mobile station exists, the stronger the signal strength transmitted from the neighboring base stations. Therefore, the mobile station <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> must frequently measure the power of pilot signals transmitted from not only base station <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> where the mobile station is located, but also the neighboring base stations <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, in order to determine the time to perform hand-over. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates the structure of antenna symbol patterns for discriminating antennas when a base station transmits the same pilot channel signals through two antennas. According to the specification of 3GPP, a frame of a physical channel consists of a plurality of time slots (e.g., 15 time slots) and has a specific time duration (e.g., 10 msec). Data of each time slot of the frame is spread over a plurality of chips (e.g., 256 chips) by a scramble code generated in a scramble code generator (not shown). Each pilot symbol is also spread over 256 chips by the scramble code. The spread 256 chips per antenna symbol are spread over a pilot channel signal by an antenna pattern symbol. The first antenna symbol pattern is composed of 15 time slots whose sign are all the same, while the second antenna symbol is composed of 15 time slots where two slots of each pair of slots has an opposite sign. In other words, slots 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11, 14 and 15 of the frame have an opposite sign comparing to the rest of the slots of the frame. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates that a base station using diversity techniques simultaneously transmits pilot channel signals spread by the antenna symbol pattern of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> through two antennas. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, unmodulated pilot symbols consisting of all 1&apos;s are spread by Orthogonal Variable Spreading Factor Code (OVSF code) in multiplier <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. The spread pilot symbols output from the multiplier <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> are spread over 256 chips per symbol by I/Q scramble codes generated by the scramble code generator <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> in multipliers <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>. The I/Q scramble codes are a digital data sequence allotted for each base station. Each spread I/Q signal output from multipliers <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> is spread over the first pilot channel signal by multiplexing the first antenna symbol pattern provided by the first antenna symbol pattern generator <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> in multipliers <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, respectively. The spread I/Q signals output from each multipliers <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> are also spread over the second pilot channel signal by multiplexing the second antenna symbol pattern provided by the second antenna symbol pattern generator <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> in multipliers <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, respectively. The first pilot channel signal corresponding to the spread I/Q signals spread by the first antenna symbol pattern is combined in an adder <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>, and is transmitted through the first antenna <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight> after frequency modulating in a modulator (not shown). The second pilot channel signal corresponding to the spread I/Q signals spread by the second antenna symbol pattern is combined in a second adder <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, and is transmitted through the second antenna <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> after being frequency modulated in a modulator (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> As described in the above, base stations simultaneously transmit the spread pilot channel signals spread respectively by two antenna symbol patterns through two antennas. Therefore, when a mobile station measures the power of pilot channel signals by using the method of IS-95, the mobile station must separate the received pilot channel signals into the first and second pilot channel signal. This is because the pilot channel signals received by the mobile station consist of the first pilot channel signal spread by the first antenna symbol pattern, and the second pilot channel signal spread by the second antenna symbol pattern. The mobile station accumulates the received pilot channel signals for at least a two-slot period in order to separate the first and second pilot channel signals. When measuring the power of the first pilot channel signal transmitted from the first antenna of a base station, a mobile station despreads the received pilot channel signal by every two slots of a frame, such as pair of slots -AA- of the first antenna symbol pattern in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> so that the mobile station can eliminate the second pilot channel signal which is transmitted from the second antenna of a base station among the received pilot channel signals having the first and second pilot channel signals combined. This method, however, does not measure the power of the second pilot channel signal transmitted from the second antenna of the base station. Thus, even though the second antenna of the base station transmits the pilot channel signal having a higher power than the first antenna, the mobile station may make an wrong handoff decision based upon power of the first pilot channel signal transmitted from the first antenna. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, after receiving pilot channel signals which combine the first and second pilot channel signals that are spread in a base station, a mobile station may separate the first and second pilot channel signals from the received pilot channel signals by multiplying the first or second antenna symbol patterns and the received pilot channel signals. The I/Q pilot channel signals received by the mobile station are despread in multipliers <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> by signals generated in multipliers <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight>, in order to separate the first pilot channel signal from the despread pilot channel signals. The signals generated in multipliers <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight> are obtained by multiplexing a scramble code generated in the scramble code generator <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> and the first antenna symbol pattern, which is generated in the first antenna symbol pattern generator <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> of the mobile station. The received I/Q pilot channel signals are also despread in multipliers <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>509</bold></highlight> by signals generated in multipliers <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>, in order to separate the second pilot channel signal from the despread pilot channel signals. The signals generated in multipliers <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> are obtained by multiplexing a scramble code generated in the scramble code generator <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>, and the second antenna symbol pattern, which is generated in the second antenna symbol pattern generator <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight> of the mobile station. Using the above method, the pilot channel signals received by the mobile terminal through an antenna are separated into the first and second pilot channel signals, respectively. Each separated first and second pilot channel signal is integrated at integrators <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>513</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> at every two slots. The integrated value output from the integrators is multiplied at squarers <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>521</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight>, and are exclusively combined at exclusive combiners <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight>, respectively. That is, the power of each pilot channel signal transmitted from the two antennas of a base station is obtained. As a result, the power of each of the pilot channel signals of the two antennas are combined in an adder <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight>, and thus the mobile station may measure the whole power of the pilot channel signals of the base station regardless of the ratio of receiving power of each antenna at every two slots. This method, however, should have the received pilot channel signals separated into the first and second pilot channel signals since the received pilot channel signals received through the antenna of the mobile terminal are the combined first and second pilot channel signals. Consequently, these steps, such as generating two antennas symbol patterns and despreading the received signals, make the hardware structure of the mobile station very complicated. The integrators <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>513</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> must integrate 512 chips (that is, two times 256 chips), which corresponds to one symbol period, so that this limitation in designing circuits results in negative effects in power measurement in conditions such as fading, frequency error, or so on. </paragraph>

In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a more thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well known functions or constructions have not been described so as not to obscure the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates the structure of a power measurement means for measuring the power of pilot channel signals according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The power measurement means of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is included in each digital data receiver <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Referring <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6</cross-reference>, a mobile station receives pilot channel signals consisting of the first and second pilot channel signal through an antenna <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>. The received pilot channel signals are converted into an I/Q digital signal through an RF processor <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and A/D converter <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The converted I/Q signals are provided to digital data receivers <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> and searcher <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight>, respectively. The spreading of the I/Q signals are implemented in each digital data receivers whose structure are described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the I/Q signals is spread by an I/Q scramble code, which is generated by a scramble code generator <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight>, in multipliers <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>. After being spread in multipliers <highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> of element <highlight><bold>611</bold></highlight> by the first antenna symbol pattern generated by the first antenna symbol generator <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight>, each spread I/Q signal from multipliers <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> are provided to integrators <highlight><bold>607</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight>. The integrator <highlight><bold>607</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> of integrator <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> integrate the despread I/Q signals by 256 chips for each time slot period corresponding to each pilot symbol, and then output the I/Q signals representing the amplitude of the pilot channel signals. The I/Q signals output from the integrators <highlight><bold>607</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> are provided to squarer <highlight><bold>609</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> of squarer <highlight><bold>613</bold></highlight> through switches <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>615</bold></highlight>, respectively, which are connected at the end time of each time slot period. In order to obtain the power of the pilot channel signals for each time slot period, the amplitudes of the signals provided by the integrators <highlight><bold>607</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> are multiplied by the squarer <highlight><bold>609</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> of squarer <highlight><bold>613</bold></highlight> and are added by an adder <highlight><bold>616</bold></highlight>. The power value of the pilot channel signals for one time slot period, which is output from the adder <highlight><bold>616</bold></highlight>, is delayed by next time slot in delay means <highlight><bold>617</bold></highlight>. The adder <highlight><bold>618</bold></highlight> adds the power value of the pilot channel signals of the next time slot period being provided by the adder <highlight><bold>616</bold></highlight>, and the power value which is delayed for one time slot and inputted by the delay means <highlight><bold>617</bold></highlight>. The signal or information which represents the power value of a two time slot period is provided by the adder (<highlight><bold>616</bold></highlight>) is provided to a processor (not shown) by the switch (<highlight><bold>619</bold></highlight>), which is connected at the end of every two time slot, and then transmits to base stations. That is, any person skilled in the art easily understands that information output from the exclusive adder (<highlight><bold>618</bold></highlight>) corresponds to the combination of two power values of each pilot channel signal, which is transmitted separately from two antennas of a base station, through two time slots. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, those skilled in the art will also understand that the present invention may be accomplished without the first antenna symbol pattern generator <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> and multipliers <highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the measuring steps of a mobile station for measuring power of pilot channel signals transmitted from two antennas of a base station will now be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Assuming that the total pilot power value transmitted from the two antennas of a base station is 1, the power ratio of each pilot channel signal received by a mobile station may be described by 1&minus;x:x. The power value of x, thus, may range between 0 and 1. What x&equals;0, a base station transmits signals over only one antenna or does not use diversity techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> A mobile station receives pilot channel signals consisting of the first and second channel signals through its antennas. The received pilot channel signals are separated into I/Q signals, and despread into 256 chips by a scramble code in multipliers <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. The despread I/Q signals are integrated in integrator <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> for each time slot period to obtain the amplitude of the pilot channel signals. Generally, since P (Power) &prop;A<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>(Amplitude) and the pilot channel signals consist of the first and second pilot channel signals, the amplitude value of signal which corresponds to the 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 12 and 13 time slot periods of a frame is described as {square root}1&minus;x&plus;{square root}x. The amplitude of signal of each of the 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11 and 14<highlight><superscript>th </superscript></highlight>time slot period is {square root}1&minus;x&minus;{square root}x since the second pilot channel signal has an opposite sign over the above time slots. Generally, since the amplitude of 15<highlight><superscript>th </superscript></highlight>time slot period is not used the 256 chips corresponding to 15<highlight><superscript>th </superscript></highlight>time slot of the frame may not be despread. The squarer <highlight><bold>613</bold></highlight> squares the amplitude provided by the integrator <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> in order to obtain power of the pilot channel signals. The value representing power of each of the 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 12 and 13<highlight><superscript>th </superscript></highlight>slot, thus, corresponds 1&plus;2{square root}x(1&minus;x), and the value representing power of each of the 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11, 14 and 15<highlight><superscript>th </superscript></highlight>slot corresponds 1&minus;2{square root}x(1&minus;x). Therefore, the combined value of the two power values output from each squarer <highlight><bold>609</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> 0f squarer <highlight><bold>613</bold></highlight> and delay means <highlight><bold>617</bold></highlight> is equal to 2, namely 1&plus;2{square root}x(1&minus;x)&plus;1&minus;2{square root}x(1&minus;x)&equals;2. As a result, the mobile station measures power of each first and second pilot channel signal regardless of the power ratio transmitted from the two antennas of a base station. Therefore, the mobile station measures the total power of any base station regardless of the transmission form of any base station or power ratio of the two antennas received by the mobile terminal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The above description of the preferred embodiment is provided to enable any person skilled in the art to make or use the present invention. Various modifications to the preferred embodiments will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, and the generic principles defined herein may be applied to other embodiments. For example, the first antenna symbol pattern generator may replace the second antenna symbol pattern generator. In addition, the location of the scramble code generator and antenna symbol pattern generator to spread the received pilot channel signals may be changed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, even though the number of antenna symbol patterns are over 3, a mobile terminal may measure the total power of any base station by using the means of the present invention. Thus, the present invention is not intended to be limited to the embodiment shown but is to be defined by the scope and spirit of the appended claims. </paragraph>
