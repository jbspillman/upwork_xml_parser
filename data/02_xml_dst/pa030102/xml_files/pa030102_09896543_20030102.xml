<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A method and apparatus for measuring the torque transmitted by a member comprises a SAW device (<highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>) secured to the member such that mechanical stress in the member due to torque transmitted thereby induces bending of the SAW device. Means are provided for measuring the change in resonant frequency of the SAW device induced by bending.

<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method for measuring torque and, particularly, but not exclusively, to a method for measuring the torque arising in a rotating shaft. Also, the invention relates to a member for transmitting torque incorporating means for measuring torque transmitted by said member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> It is well known for Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) devices to be used for measuring parameters such as temperature and strain. Such devices are comprised of a SAW resonator made up of a micro-structure deposited on a piezoelectric substrate. The deposit is arranged to form at least one pair of interleaved comb-like electrodes. Typically, the electrodes are made from aluminum (although other good conductors may be used) and have a thickness in the order of 100 Angstroms. The piezoelectric substrate is typically manufactured from ceramic or quartz material. The electrodes are protected by an insulating lid member which covers one side of the substrate. The arrangement is such that the electrodes are completely encapsulated between the substrate and the lid member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In use, the application of an electric pulse signal to one electrode of an electrode pair causes the associated SAW resonator to act as a transducer. The electric input signal is converted to an acoustic wave which is transmitted via the substrate to the other electrode of the electrode pair. On arrival of the acoustic wave at said other electrode, the transducing process is reversed and an electric output signal is generated. This output signal has a characteristic resonant frequency which is dependent upon a number of factors including the geometry of the micro-structure deposit (e.g. the spacing between the interleaved electrodes). Since the spacing of the interleaved electrodes within an electrode pair varies as the substrate is deformed (e.g. by virtue of temperature variations or the application of a mechanical force), a change in the condition of a SAW resonator can be determined by monitoring the resonant frequency. In this way, parameters such as temperature and strain which affect the condition of a SAW resonator may be measured. For example, if the temperature of a SAW resonator is reduced, then the piezoelectric substrate reduces in size and the interleaved electrodes move closer together. As a result. the resonant frequency of the SAW resonator increases. This increase can be measured and calibrated to provide an indication of the temperature change. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A known method of measuring torque in a shaft or other torque transmitting member through use of one or more SAW resonators is described in EP 0 518 900 B1. A preferred arrangement disclosed in this prior art is shown schematically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> of the accompanying drawings. A shaft <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is provided with two SAW resonators <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for sensing compressive and tensile strain. Each SAW resonator <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> incorporates a pair of electrodes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The two SAW resonators <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are mounted on the shaft <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with their centre lines <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> located at right angles to one another and at 45&deg; to the shaft longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The resonator substrates are each securely attached to the surface of the shaft <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by means of an adhesive. Thus, stress generated in the shaft <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> due to a transmission of torque thereby results in a strain being induced in each SAW resonator <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Torque applied to the shaft <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the clockwise direction shown by arrow <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> induces compressive strain in the first SAW resonator <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and tensile strain in the second SAW resonator <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. If the torque direction is reversed, then the first SAW resonator <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is placed in tension and the second SAW resonator is placed in compression. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The first and second SAW resonators <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are respectively coupled with first and second amplifiers <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) which respectively provide input signal frequencies F<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and F<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>to a mixer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The mixer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> generates an output signal frequency F having F<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&plus;F<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and F<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&minus;F<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>components. The torque transmitted by the shaft <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is measured by reference to the change in input signal frequencies F<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, F<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>generated by the SAW resonators <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. This change in frequencies arises from a change in shape of the resonator substrates as a consequence of a deformation of the shaft surface upon which the resonators are secured. Changes in substrate geometry due to temperature, for example, apply to both of the SAW resonators <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> equally. Thus, the F<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&minus;F<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>component of the mixer output frequency F provides an indication of only the torque transmitted by the shaft <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, irrespective of temperature, when the torque transmitted by the shaft <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is zero for example, the F<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&minus;F<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>component will be zero (or close to zero). The F<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&plus;F<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>component of the mixer output signal frequency F provides an indication of the temperature of the material to which the substrate of each SAW resonator is secured. In this way, compensation may be made for variations in deformation characteristics with ambient temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A further prior art arrangement is disclosed in JP 59060332 A. In this further arrangement, first and second SAW resonators are mounted by means of adhesive on a flexible beam extending between two rings longitudinally spaced on a torque transmitting shaft. The SAW resonators are longitudinally spaced on the flexible beam so as to sense compressive and tensile strain, and thereby allow for temperature variations. In use, torque transmitted by the shaft produces a circumferential offsetting of the two rings which, in turn, causes a deformation of the flexible beam. The resultant strains induced in the SAW resonators generate a variation in resonant frequencies. This allows the torque transmitted by the shaft to be determined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Although the arrangements disclosed in the aforementioned prior art are effective at measuring torque, a number of problems are nevertheless associated therewith. Firstly, it is desirable in the prior art arrangements for two separate SAW resonators (having discrete substrates) to be provided in order to compensate for temperature variations. These separate resonators must be each individually secured in a required orientation relative to both each other and the member upon which they are mounted. This can be time consuming and tends to undesirably increase manufacturing costs. Furthermore, the reliance on two separate resonators for temperature compensation can lead to reliability problems. In the prior art arrangements, if a substrate becomes cracked, then an erroneous signal will tend to be generated by the damaged SAW resonator. Typically, the damaged SAW resonator will fail to generate any signal. If this occurs, then the F<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&minus;F<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>component will give rise to an incorrect torque measurement. The failure of a SAW resonator may not be evident from the incorrect measurement and an operator or associated system will be generally unaware of the measurement error. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A further problem associated with the prior art arrangements arises from the need for an adhesive to both retain the SAW resonators in the required orientation and reliably transmit strain between the resonator substrates and the surface upon which the resonators are mounted. In the prior art, the SAW resonators are arranged so as to stretch or contract in a plane along their centre lines. The stretching and contracting forces are applied to the resonators via the adhesive. If the sheer characteristics of the adhesive are poor, then the performance of the prior art arrangements in determining torque will be adversely affected. This is particularly the case where torque is applied to a shaft for prolonged periods of time. In these circumstances, adhesives tend to fail and the resonators either become detached from the shaft or relax back to an unstrained condition. Furthermore, the use of adhesive can undesirably limit the temperature range in which torque can be reliably measured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide a method of measuring torque in a convenient, reliable and relatively inexpensive manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It is a further object of the present invention to provide a member for transmitting torque which comprises means for measuring said torque in a convenient, reliable and relatively inexpensive manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A first aspect of the present invention provides a method of measuring torque transmitted by a member. the method comprising the step of retaining a SAW resonator adjacent said member in such an orientation that, during use of said member, mechanical stress in said member due to a torque transmitted thereby induces mechanical strain in the SAW resonator, said induced strain in the SAW resonator being at least substantially generated by a bending of the SAW resonator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Thus, a method according to the present invention provides for the retaining of a SAW resonator adjacent a torque transmitting member so that, upon torque transmission, the strain induced in the SAW resonator is at least substantially generated by the SAW resonator undergoing a bending action. This is in contrast to the prior art arrangements in which SAW resonators are subjected to strain by virtue of a stretching or contraction within the plane of their substrate. Since the method of the present invention provides for the bending of a SAW resonator during torque transmission, certain substrate portions of the resonator will be subjected to compressive strain whilst other substrate portions will be subjected to tensile strain. This is a well known characteristic of a bending beam. Accordingly, a first electrode pair may be arranged on a first substrate portion which is subjected to compressive strain during bending of the SAW resonator, whilst a second electrode pair may be arranged on a second substrate portion which is subjected to tensile strain during bending. For example, the first and second electrode pairs may be located on opposite sides of the resonator substrate. In this way, a single SAW resonator having merely one discrete substrate may be used to provide torque measurement with temperature compensation. If the substrate becomes damaged (e.g. cracked), then each electrode pair will tend to be affected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the orientation of the SAW resonator is such that a plane in which electrodes of the resonator are arranged is at an angle to a portion of the surface of said member adjacent the resonator. Ideally, said angle is 90&deg;. It is also preferable for the orientation of the SAW resonator to be such that a longitudinal axis of said member about which said torque is applied lies in or is substantially parallel to a plane in which electrodes of the resonator are arranged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, it is preferable for the step of retaining the SAW resonator adjacent said member to comprise the step of providing said member with means integral to said member for receiving the SAW resonator in said orientation. The step of providing means for receiving the resonator may comprise the step of forming a slot in said member. The step of forming a slot may comprise the steps of drilling a hole in said member and cutting one or more slots into the wall of the hole. The step of forming a slot may comprise the steps of forming a recess in said member which extends about a longitudinal axis of said member and cutting one or more slots into one or more walls of the recess. The slot may be of such a size that the SAW resonator is clamped by the slot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> It is also desirable for the step of retaining the SAW resonator adjacent said member to comprise the step of varying the size of the slot and/or the SAW resonator by varying the temperature thereof so as to assist in locating the resonator within the slot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> A second aspect of the present invention provides a member for transmitting torque comprising a SAW resonator orientated so that, during use of said member, mechanical stress in said member due to a torque transmitted thereby induces mechanical strain the SAW resonator, said induced strain in the SAW resonator being at least substantially generated by a bending of the SAW resonator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the orientation of the SAW resonator is such that a plane in which electrodes of the resonator are arranged is at an angle to a portion of the surface of said member adjacent the resonator. Ideally, said angle is 90&deg;. It is also preferable for the orientation of the SAW resonator to be such that a longitudinal axis of said member about which said torque is applied lies in or is substantially parallel to a plane in which electrodes of the resonator are arranged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, it is preferable for said member to comprise integral means for receiving the SAW resonator in said orientation. The means for receiving the resonator may be a slot in said member. Preferably, the slot is of such a size that the SAW resonator is clamped by the slot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> It is preferable for the SAW resonator to comprise two pairs of electrodes. The two pairs of electrodes are preferably arranged on the same side of a substrate so as to be located at different locations along the longitudinal axis of said member. Alternatively the two pairs of electrodes may be arranged on opposite sides of a substrate. The two pairs of electrodes preferably have different geometries so as to be operable at different frequencies. The SAW resonator may comprise four pairs of electrodes, wherein two pairs of electrodes are arranged on opposite sides of a substrate. The four pairs of electrodes preferably have different geometries so as to be operable at different frequencies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> A third aspect of the present invention provides a method of measuring torque transmitted by a member, the method comprising the step of retaining a SAW resonator adjacent said member with means for receiving and restricting displacement of the SAW resonator. The means for receiving and restricting displacement of the SAW resonator is preferably integral with said member. The means for receiving and restricting displacement of the SAW resonator preferably clamps the SAW resonator. The step of retaining a SAW resonator adjacent said member may comprise the step of forming a slot in said member. The step of forming a slot may comprise the steps of drilling a hole in said member and cutting one or more slots into the wall of the hole. The step of forming a slot may comprise the steps of forming a recess in said member which extends about an longitudinal axis of said member and cutting one or more slots into one or more walls of the recess. It is also desirable for the step of retaining the SAW resonator adjacent said member to comprise the step of varying the size of the slot and/or the SAW resonator by varying the temperature thereof so as to assist in locating the resonator within the slot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A fourth aspect of the present invention provides a member for transmitting torque comprising a SAW resonator retained adjacent said member by means for receiving and restricting displacement of the SAW resonator. The means for receiving and restricting displacement of the SAW resonator is preferably integral with said member. The means for receiving and restricting displacement of the SAW resonator preferably clamps the SAW resonator. The means for receiving and restricting displacement of the SAW resonator is preferably a slot defined in said member.</paragraph>

<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> As discussed hereinabove, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> of the accompanying drawings show the prior art arrangement for measuring torque in a shaft described in EP 0 518 900 B1. The prior art arrangement provides first and second SAW resonators <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> securely attached by means of adhesive to the surface of a shaft <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Each SAW resonator <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> incorporates a pair of electrodes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The electrodes of each SAW resonator <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are arranged on the shaft surface so as to have differing orientations. The arrangement is such that, when the shaft <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> transmits a torque and undergoes consequential twisting, the SAW resonators <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> either stretch or contract along their centre lines <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. In this way, the spacing between the interleaved electrodes of an electrode pair is varied so as to generate a change in resonant frequency. The stretching or contracting of a resonator along its centre line generally occurs in the plane of the substrate without significant bending. Indeed, a significant tendency for the SAW resonators to bend upon torque transmission by the shaft is undesirable since such a tendency would increase the demands on the adhesive and possibly lead to the resonators becoming detached from the shaft surface. However, due to the very small size of the SAW resonators and the small twisting deflection typically experienced by a torque transmitting shaft, either zero or close to zero bending of the SAW resonators occurs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> An arrangement according to the present invention is shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. A shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> adapted to transmit torque is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> in an unstrained condition. The shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is provided with a circular hole <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> which extends from one side of the shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to an opposite side thereof. The longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the hole <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> intersects with the longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Said two axes <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are perpendicular to one another. Two slots <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> extend radially from the hole axis <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> into opposite wall portions of one end <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of the hole <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> in particular). Identical slots <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are also located at an opposite end <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of the hole <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The slots <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> lie on the same plane as the hole and shaft axes <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> (when the shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is an unstrained condition). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Each pair of slots <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is of sufficient depth and width to receive a single SAW resonator <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. The SAW resonator <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> extends from one slot to an opposite slot so as to span the diameter of the hole <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The width of the slots <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is such that the SAW resonator <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> forms an interference fit therewith. The SAW resonator <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is therefore clamped in position by the slots <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. However, in an alternative embodiment, a SAW resonator may fit loosely within a slot pair and be thereby adequately retained adjacent a shaft. In the present embodiment, the slots <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are sufficiently deep for a SAW resonator <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to be held below the outer surface of the shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, the hole <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and slots <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are filled with silicone rubber so as to totally encapsulate and protect each SAW resonator <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> A schematic plan view of a SAW resonator <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> of the accompanying drawings. The SAW resonator <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> comprises an elongate substrate <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> upon which two electrode pairs <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> are mounted. The electrode pairs <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> are located at opposite end portions and arranged on the same side of the substrate <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. As is known in the art, each electrode pair <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is provided with a pair of reflectors <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. A lid member <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is secured to the substrate <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> so as to cover and thereby protect the electrode pairs <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. The lid member <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> also partially covers coupling means <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> common to both electrode pairs <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. This coupling means <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> allows for the connection of the SAW resonator <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to an amplifier and means (not shown) for supplying an excitation signal to the resonator and for receiving a response signal from the resonator. The electrode pairs <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> have differing configurations (not apparent from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) so as to be operable at different frequencies. This allows for the use of the common coupling means <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. A side view of the SAW resonator <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> An alternative embodiment of the present invention may incorporate a SAW resonator having a different electrode pair arrangement to that of the SAW resonator <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 8</cross-reference>. For example, a SAW resonator <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> may be used having merely a single electrode pair <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>). Alternatively, a SAW resonator may be provided having two electrode pairs arranged on opposite sides of a substrate. Furthermore, a SAW resonator may be provided having four electrode pairs, two of which are arranged on one side of a substrate and two of which are arranged on an opposite side of said substrate. In cases where electrode pairs are arranged on both sides of a substrate, both of said substrate sides are provided with a lid member. In all cases, it is preferable for electrode pairs to have differing configurations so as to be operable independently by excitation signals of different frequencies. A common coupling means may then be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In use, a twisting of the shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> about the shaft axis <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> will generate a bending of the two SAW resonators <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. The electrode pairs <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> are located on the resonator substrate <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> so as to be subjected to maximum levels of compressive/tensile strain upon resonator bending. Thus, when the shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is subjected to a torque applied in the direction indicated by arrow <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). the SAW resonators <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> are elastically bent into an S shape which places each side of the resonator substrate <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> into both tension and compression. This is a well-known characteristic of a bending beam and will be readily understood by those skilled in the art. As a consequence of the bending action shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the portion of substrate <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> adjacent the first electrode pair <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is placed in tension whilst the portion of substrate <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> adjacent the second electrode pair <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is placed in compression. The resultant resonant frequencies from the two electrode pairs <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> allow for torque measurement with temperature compensation in a manner similar to that discussed in relation to the prior art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The arrangement shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is manufactured by forming a hole <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> in an appropriate shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> using conventional drilling techniques. Once formed. the hole <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> allows appropriate cutting tools access for cutting of the slots <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Where the dimensions of the slots <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are such that the associated SAW resonator <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> forms an interference fit therewith, assembly is assisted by heating and thereby expanding the shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in the region of the hole <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. In this way, the slots <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> tend to widen so as to allow unrestricted insertion of a resonator. Once the resonator is located satisfactorily within a pair of slots, the shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may be allowed to cool. The pair of slots will then tend to contract and clamp the resonator. The hole <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and exposed portions of the slots <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are then filled with silicone rubber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The present invention is not limited to the specific embodiment or method descried above. Alternative arrangements and suitable material will be apparent to a reader skilled in the art. For example, the hole <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> may be oval in cross-section rather than circular. Indeed, access for suitable slot cutting tools may be provided by means other than a hole <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. In this regard, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</cross-reference> of the accompanying drawings show an alternative embodiment of the present invention in which a circumferential recess <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is formed in the surface of a shaft <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. The recess <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> may be conveniently provided by means of conventional turning techniques. An appropriate number of slots <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may then be cut into the walls of the recess <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> for receiving the required number of SAW resonators <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</cross-reference>. two resonators <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> are provided on opposite sides of the shaft <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, however an alternative number of resonators may be used. In addition, although the shaft <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> (and the shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) is provided with two identical SAW resonators <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, it may be desirable in certain applications for the electrode pairs on the two resonator substrates to have differing configurations so as to be independently operable at different signal frequencies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> A further alternative embodiment of the present invention is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> of the accompanying drawings. This figure shows a further shaft <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> having two portions <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> of enlarged diameter between which two SAW resonators <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> extend. The ends of each SAW resonator <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> are located in slots <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> (or, alternatively, recesses) defined in the enlarged diameter portions <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>. Where a SAW resonator <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is located in one or more recesses, assembly of the apparatus may be completed by resiliently bending the subject SAW resonator <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> into position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> A yet further alternative embodiment of the present invention is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> of the accompanying drawings. In this figure, two SAW resonators <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> extend radially from opposite sides of a yet further shaft <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. This is in contrast to the previously described embodiment wherein the SAW resonators have been arranged so as to extend in a longitudinal direction relative to the associated shaft. In the arrangement of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, one end of each SAW resonator <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is located in a recess <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> provided in the shaft <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The end of each saw resonator <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> opposite to that located in the recess <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is itself located in a recess <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> provided in an arm <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The arrangement shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> comprises two arms <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, each of which extends spaced from the shaft <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in a direction parallel to the longitudinal axis of the shaft <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The arrangement is such that one end <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> of each arm <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is longitudinally spaced from the associated SAW resonator <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. This end <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is rigidly secured to the shaft <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Each arm <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> may be integrally formed with the shaft <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> or attached to said shaft <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> during assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In both the assemblies of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</cross-reference>, it will be understood by a person skilled in the art that the described provision of the SAW resonators <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> will permit the measurement of torque through an associated shaft <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
