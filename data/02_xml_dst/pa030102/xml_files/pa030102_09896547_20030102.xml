<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A cable television (CATV) distribution system transmits a broadcast signal and a narrowcast signal. While the broadcast signal in intended to be transmitted to all end users, the narrowcast signal is intended to be selectively transmitted to a narrow group of end users. The broadcast signal is transmitted from a headend to a hub. The narrowcast signal is generated within the hub. A transmitter at the hub transmits to a CATV node the narrowcast signal combined with the broadcast signal. Unfortunately, the transmitter at the hub is expensive. Additionally, it is costly to generate the narrowcast signal. Accordingly, there to a need to reduce costs associated with narrowcast signal generation and transmission within a hub of a CATV distribution system. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a block diagram of a cable television (CATV) distribution system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. The CATV distribution system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes an optical coupler <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> at a CATV hub <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, wherein the optical coupler <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> combines a broadcast optical signal <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> with a narrowcast optical signal <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> to form a composite optical signal <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The optical coupler <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> comprises any device known to one of ordinary skill in the art for combining a plurality of optical signals into a composite optical signal (e.g., a wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) device). The composite optical signal <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is transmitted to a CATV node <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> which converts the composite optical signal <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to a composite electrical signal <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to be transmitted to a terminal site such as, inter alia, a set-top box. Although <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows one CATV hub <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the CATV distribution system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may include a plurality of such CATV hubs <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Similarly, although <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows one CATV node <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the CATV distribution system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may include a plurality of such CATV nodes <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> coupled to each CATV hub <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the broadcast optical signal <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is transmitted through an optical network <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> from a broadcast source <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the hub <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The optical network <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> comprises various types of optical fibers of various lengths such as, inter alia, signal mode fiber and dispersion shifted fiber. The optical network <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> may also comprise, inter alia, erbium doped fiber amplifiers (EDFA), and semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOA), dense wavelength division multiplexer (DWDM), and other similar optical devices. The broadcast optical signal <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is propagated at a carrier wavelength such as, inter alia, 1550 nanometers (nm), modulated over a frequency bandwidth such as, inter alia, 50 to 550 MHZ. There are alternative ways for the broadcast optical signal <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to be generated at the broadcast source <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. As a first alternative way, the broadcast optical signal <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may be an externally modulated signal. An example of an externally modulated signal is a laser-generated signal that passes through an external modulator which modulates the signal. As a second alternative way, the broadcast optical signal <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may be a directly modulated signal. An example of a directly modulated signal includes modulation of the laser itself such that the laser-generated signal is modulated upon its generation. An externally modulated signal and a directly modulated signal may each be generated by a headend and transmitted to the hub <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> over optical fibers. As a third alternative way, the broadcast optical signal <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may be directly injected into the hub <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> from a local satellite farm source without use of optical fibers for the transmission. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a narrowcast source <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> that generates the narrowcast optical signal <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and transmits the narrowcast optical signal <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> to the optical coupler <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, wherein the optical coupler <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is in the hub <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Although the narrowcast source <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> as being within the hub <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the narrowcast source <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be external to the hub <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> such that the narrowcast optical signal <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is piped from an external narrowcast source <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to the hub <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The narrowcast source <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is an uncooled laser that generates the narrowcast optical signal <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> at a carrier wavelength such as, inter alia, 1310 nm, modulated over a frequency bandwidth such as, inter alia, 570 to 870 MHZ. Generally, the narrowcast optical signal <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and the broadcast optical signal <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> have different carrier wavelengths. The uncooled laser is a laser that dissipates heat into the ambient environment without any special cooling apparatus. The uncooled laser may include, inter alia, a distributed feedback (DFB) laser or a vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL). The uncooled laser of the present invention is inexpensive and permits use of the optical coupler <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which is also inexpensive. Thus, use of the uncooled laser substantially reduces costs in comparison with a relatively expensive transmitter at the hub <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, wherein such an expensive transmitter is conventionally used in the related art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The composite optical signal <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that is transmitted through an optical network <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> to the node <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is received at an optical demultiplexer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> at the node <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The optical network <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is similar to the optical network <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, described supra. The optical demultiplexer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> splits the composite optical signal <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> into a narrowcast optical signal <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> (equivalent to the narrowcast optical signal <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>) and a broadcast optical signal <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> (equivalent to the broadcast optical signal <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>). The optical demultiplexer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> comprises any device known to one of ordinary skill in the art for splitting a composite optical signal into a plurality of optical signals (e.g., a WDM device). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The node <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> further comprises a broadcast receiver <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, a narrowcast receiver <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, and an electrical coupler <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The broadcast receiver <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> receives the broadcast optical signal <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and converts the broadcast optical signal <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> into a broadcast electrical signal <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. The narrowcast receiver <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> receives the narrowcast optical signal <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and converts the narrowcast optical signal <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> into a narrowcast electrical signal <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The electrical coupler <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> combines the narrowcast electrical signal <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> with the broadcast electrical signal <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> to generate the composite electrical signal <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The electrical coupler <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> comprises any device known to one of ordinary skill in the art for combining a plurality of electrical signals into a composite electrical signal (e.g., a combine diplex). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> depicts a representative broadcast signal frequency bandwidth of 50 to 550 MHZ associated with the broadcast optical signal <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> or the equivalent broadcast optical signal <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Other examples of broadcast signal frequency bandwidths include, inter alia, 50 to 750 MHZ, 50-1000 MHZ, etc. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> also depicts a representative narrowcast signal frequency bandwidth of 570 to 870 MHZ associated with the narrowcast optical signal <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> or the equivalent narrowcast optical signal <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Other narrowcast signal frequency bandwidths may be used. While <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows the narrowcast signal frequency band as being higher in frequency than the broadcast signal frequency band, the narrowcast signal frequency band may be lower in frequency than the broadcast signal frequency band. While <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows the narrowcast and broadcast signal frequency bands as being non-overlapping, the narrowcast and broadcast signal frequency bands may overlap under conditions to be discussed infra. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> While <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows one contiguous broadcast signal frequency band for the broadcast optical signal <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, and one contiguous narrowcast signal frequency band for the narrowcast optical signal <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the narrowcast and broadcast signal frequency bands may each be distributed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. A broadcast signal frequency band is distributed if the frequencies included therein are non-contiguous. A narrowcast signal frequency band is distributed if the frequencies included therein are non-contiguous. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> depicts distributed broadcast signal frequency bands B<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and B<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, and distributed narrowcast signal frequency bands N<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. While <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows two non-contiguous broadcast signal frequency bands B<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and B<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>associated with the broadcast optical signal <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the broadcast optical signal <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> may include any number of such non-contiguous broadcast signal frequency bands. While <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows two non-contiguous narrowcast signal frequency bands N<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>associated with the narrowcast optical signal <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the narrowcast optical signal <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> may include any number of such noncontiguous narrowcast signal frequency bands. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> A separate broadcast receiver <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and narrowcast receiver <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is generally needed because the narrowcast frequency band is seen by the broadcast receiver <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> as frequency distortion. Thus, if distortions caused by the broadcast optical signal <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is not adversely impacted by distortions relating to the narrowcast optical signal <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, then the broadcast receiver <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and narrowcast receiver <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> may be replaced by one receiver <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> as is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the optical coupler <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the optical demultiplexer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and the electrical coupler <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> are unnecessary and do not appear. Additionally, the narrowcast optical signal <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> may be transmitted through an optical network <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> from the narrowcast source <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to the one receiver <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, and the optical network <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> is similar to the optical network <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> described supra in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the receiver <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> receives the broadcast optical signal <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the narrowcast optical signal <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> as input, and generates the composite electrical signal <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> as output. As an example, the CATV distribution system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is applicable if the broadcast receiver <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is not adversely impacted by the narrowcast optical signal <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> with respect to: carrier to noise ratio (CNR); composite second order distortion (CSO); and composite triple beat (CTB). Note that the uncooled laser is a nonlinear device that may generate narrowcast distortion signals having such second-order frequency distortion and third-order frequency distortion. As another example, the CATV distribution system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is applicable, if the bandwidth &Dgr;F<highlight><subscript>N </subscript></highlight>of the narrowcast optical signal <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is less than the lowest frequency F<highlight><subscript>B1 </subscript></highlight>of the broadcast optical signal <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. If &Dgr;F<highlight><subscript>N</subscript></highlight>&lt;F<highlight><subscript>B1</subscript></highlight>, then frequency distortion caused by the narrowcast optical signal <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is outside the bandwidth of the broadcast optical signal <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and does not distort the broadcast optical signal <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Thus, if the broadcast optical signal <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> has a frequency band of 50 to 550 MHZ and the narrowcast optical signal <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> has a frequency band of 570 to 610 MHZ, then &Dgr;F<highlight><subscript>N</subscript></highlight>&equals;40 MHZ and F<highlight><subscript>B1</subscript></highlight>&equals;50 MHZ. Since &Dgr;F<highlight><subscript>N</subscript></highlight>&lt;F<highlight><subscript>B1</subscript></highlight>, the one receiver <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> may be used instead of the broadcast receiver <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and narrowcast receiver <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In contrast, if the broadcast optical signal <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> has a frequency band of 50 to 550 MHZ and the narrowcast optical signal <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> has a frequency band of 550 to 860 MHZ, then &Dgr;F<highlight><subscript>N</subscript></highlight>&equals;310 MHZ and F<highlight><subscript>B1</subscript></highlight>&equals;50 MHZ. Since &Dgr;F<highlight><subscript>N </subscript></highlight>is within the bandwidth of the broadcast optical signal <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, second-order frequency distortion (CSO) and third-order frequency distortion (CTB) caused by the narrowcast optical signal <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is within the bandwidth of the broadcast optical signal <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. As a result, use of the one receiver <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> would be inappropriate unless the CSO and CTB distortion could be prevented or eliminated. Fortunately, the CSO and CTB distortion may be prevented or eliminated through use of a linearization circuit, as discussed next. </paragraph>

In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the linearization circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> transforms a radiofrequency (RF) signal <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> into a signal <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> which is used by the uncooled laser of the narrowcast source <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to generate the narrowcast optical signal <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> in which narrowcast distortion has been reduced to within a noise level tolerance of the broadcast optical signal <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The noise level tolerance is application dependent and may be expressed, inter alia, as having the carrier to noise ratio (CNR) not reduced by more than K decibels, wherein K is application dependent and may have values such as, inter alia, 0.5. </paragraph>

Alternatively, since the linearization circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> removes or substantially reduces the frequency distortion, the narrowcast optical signal <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> may be combined with the broadcast optical signal <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> by a single receiver similar to the one receiver <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Such a single receiver in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> would replace the broadcast receiver <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and narrowcast receiver <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, and also eliminate the optical coupler <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the optical demultiplexer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and the electrical coupler <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> radiofrequency (RF) signal <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> enters a circuit node <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> of the linearization circuit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> as an electrical current (I), wherein a first portion (I<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>) of the electric current I flows into a circuit path <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and a remaining portion (I<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&equals;I-I<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>) of the electric current I flows into a circuit path <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. Currents I<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and I<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>rejoin at a circuit node <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and said rejoined electrical current is then converted to the signal <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> which is used by the uncooled laser of the narrowcast source <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to generate the narrowcast optical signal <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the circuit path <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> includes a phase delay circuit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> whose function is to shift the phase of I<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>by 180 degrees relative to the phase of I<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. The circuit path <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> includes a non-linear device <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> such as, inter alia, a diode whose purpose is to generate second-order distortion &dgr;<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>(I<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) and third-order distortion &dgr;<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>(I<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) in I<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>of about the same magnitude as the corresponding second-order distortion &dgr;<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>(I<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>) and third-order distortion &dgr;<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>(I<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>) in I<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>that had been generated by the uncooled laser of the narrowcast source <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. At least one of impedances <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> may be present, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, in order to adjust the distortion amplitudes such that &dgr;<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>(I<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) and &dgr;<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>(I<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>) are about equal in magnitude and such that &dgr;<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>(I<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) and &dgr;<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>(I<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>) are about equal in magnitude, so that, in light of the phase shift in I<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>of 180 degrees, &dgr;<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>(I<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) and &dgr;<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>(I<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>) will cancel each other and &dgr;<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>(I<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) and &dgr;<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>(I<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>) will also cancel each other. Although such cancellation of distortion is easy to accomplish at one frequency, the slope equalizer <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is present in the circuit path <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to effectuate such cancellation over all frequencies of the narrowcast optical signal <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> that have second and third harmonics within the bandwidth of the broadcast optical signal <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The slope equalizer <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> accomplishes a variable phase adjustment in I<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>as a function of frequency. If the slope equalizer <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> cannot accomplish perfect cancellation of distortions at all such relevant frequencies, then the slope equalizer <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> could be used to effectuate optimal distortion cancellation for those frequencies at which the distortion is most adverse. Given <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, which teaches the linearization circuit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, one of ordinary skill in the art could construct and implement the linearization circuit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> without undue experimentation. The linearization circuit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> exemplifies a signal splitting phase shifting (SSPS) circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The narrowcast optical signal <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> may have a bandwidth not exceeding one octave as with the 570 to 870 MHZ band shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. When the narrowcast optical signal <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is within one octave, it is easier to accomplish the linearization using the linearization circuits <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, respectively. Nonetheless, it is also within the scope of the present invention for the narrowcast optical signal <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> to have a bandwidth that exceeds one octave even if the linearization circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The linearization circuits <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, respectively, may be used in conjunction with a contiguous signal frequency band of the broadcast optical signal <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the narrowcast optical signal <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, such as the contiguous broadcast and narrowcast signal frequency bands shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. The linearization circuits <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, respectively, may also be used in conjunction with non-contiguous signal frequency bands of the broadcast optical signal <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the narrowcast optical signal <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, such as the noncontiguous broadcast and narrowcast signal frequency bands shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. With the noncontiguous signal frequency bands, however, pure cancellation of distortion currents in the linearization circuit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> may not be possible, so that the linearization circuit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> may be tuned to effectuate optimal distortion cancellation at those frequencies at which the distortion is most adverse as explained supra. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The scope of the present invention includes a narrowcast optical signal generated by an uncooled laser, even if there is no broadcast optical signal present. Accordingly, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> depicts a narrowcast optical source <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> which generates a narrowcast optical signal <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. The narrowcast optical source <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> includes an uncooled laser and may exist within, or outside of, a hub <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of a CATV distribution system <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The uncooled laser may include, inter alia, a DFB laser or a VCSEL laser. The CATV distribution system <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> also includes a receiver <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> which receives the narrowcast optical signal <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and converts the narrowcast optical signal <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> into a narrowcast optical signal <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. The receiver <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> may exist within, or outside of, a CATV node <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of the CATV distribution system <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The narrowcast optical signal <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> may have any of the features or characteristics discussed supra for the narrowcast optical signal <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, such as, inter alia, having a bandwidth not exceeding one octave. </paragraph>
