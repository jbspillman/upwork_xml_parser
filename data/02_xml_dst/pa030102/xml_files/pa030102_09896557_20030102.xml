<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The subject invention relates generally to an improved spray gun utilizing coating material with a wide range of conductivity in an electrostatic spray coating system. More specifically, the subject invention relates to a rotary spray gun capable of improving the transfer efficiency of the coating by generating ionic lines to shape the spray pattern of the coating material being atomized by the spray gun. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Apparatus used for electrostatically coating objects such as, for example, an automobile body, have been in use for some time. Primarily, a voltage potential is applied to a spray head of a rotary atomizer in order to produce an electric field between the spray head and a grounded object to be coated. The charge generated by the spray head is transferred to the atomized coating material by direct contact as it is radially disbursed from the spray head. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> An additional charge ring has been added to the spray apparatus primarily, for water borne coating materials. The charge ring typically includes a plurality of electrodes concentrically aligned with the axis of the spray head. The electrodes are generally coated with an insulating material, with a small pin protruding therefrom. A high voltage cable specifically supplies the electrical potential to the electrodes necessary for generating an electrical field for charging the particles sprayed from the spray head. Often, the electrodes will be charged to generate the electric field, and the spray head will be grounded. In this type of arrangement, the entirety of the electrostatic charge transferred to the coating material is generated from the electrodes concentrically aligned with the spray head. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> While this type of electrostatic arrangement has proven quite effective for water borne based coating materials, it is not proven to be as effective for solvent borne coating materials. Therefore, the entirety of the electrostatic charge transferred to atomized particles in a solvent borne coating system is derived from the rotary spray head that has an electrical potential less than ground. Frequently, the mass of an atomized coating particle is too large when radially disbursed from the spray head will derive a physical potential greater than the electrical potential produced from the spray head. When this occurs, the atomized particle will be thrown laterally from the spray head and thus, will not be directed toward the grounded object to be painted. The frequency from which this happens is known to reduce the transfer efficiency of the atomized coating material onto the object to be painted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it would be desirable to introduce an ionization ring to a solvent borne painting apparatus that can generate an ionic field capable of overcoming the momentum of the atomized coating particles that are disbursed laterally from the spray head. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION AND ADVANTAGES </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The present invention comprises an apparatus for electrostatically coating objects with an electrically conductive coating material capable of carrying an ionic charge. A rotary atomizer utilizes a spray head that rotates on an axis at a high speed. An external housing is affixed to a support member that is oriented either horizontally or vertically depending upon the application needs of the object to be coated. The external housing pivotally supports the spray head and includes a non-conductive surface. Conductive elements such as a limb or structural band are disposed upon the housing. The conductive elements derive electrical potential that is generally the same as the electrical potential of the spray head. The non-conductive surface of the housing is at neutral potential relative to the potential of the spray head and the conductive elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> An ionizing device is positioned on the housing to contact the conductive elements. Thus, the ionizing device derives an electrical potential that is generally the same as the spray head and the conductive elements. A halo with a plurality of generally conical members spaced therearound directs ionizing lines to shape the atomized coating material being radially disbursed from the spray head. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The generally conical members generate ionic lines at substantially the same potential as the spray head and the conductive elements. The ionic lines are disbursed at an electric potential strong enough to overcome the momentum of many of the electrostatically charged, atomized particles being radially disbursed from the spray head thereby forcing these atomized particles toward the grounded object to be painted. Therefore, the ionic lines generated from the generally conical members improve the transfer efficiency of the coating material dispersed from the spray head onto the object to be painted. Further, it should be understood by those of skill in the art that a reduction in the amount of shaping air necessary to shape the atomized particles can be achieved through the utilization of the improved ionic field generated by the inventive ionization ring. Through the reduction of shaping air, a reduction in dirt trapped in the paint coating can also be achieved due to the reduction in air turbulence in the paint booth. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an apparatus for electrostatically coating objects with a coating material is generally shown at <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> affixed to a horizontally oriented support member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows three of the apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> affixed to the support member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, however, one, two, three or more of the apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be affixed to the support member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as needed to sufficiently coat an object (not shown) with the coating material. As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the apparatus includes a rotary atomizer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> having a housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and a spray head <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> includes a non-conductive surface <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and conductive elements <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The conductive elements <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> derive electrical potential from the support member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and transfer that potential to the spray head <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. A paint line <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> feeds solvent borne coating material through the support member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the spray head <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in the direction of the target. An air line <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> feeds pressurized air through the support member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and through the housing <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to shaping air apertures <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> disposed in the housing concentrically aligned with the axis of the spray head <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to shape the coating material being disbursed from the spray head <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in the direction of the target. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The spray head <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, as known in the art, atomizes the coating material by spinning at a high rate of speed and radially disbursing the atomized coating from an annular spray edge <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The spray head <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> ionizes the atomized coating material at a potential that is lower than ground. Preferably, the potential is approximately &minus;90 KV. However, the operating range is between &minus;70 and &minus;100 KV depending upon the coating operation being performed. The object to be painted is typically grounded and, therefore, the ionized particles are attracted to the object to be painted as is well known in the art. The support member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the conductive elements <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and the spray head <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> each have an electrical potential that is generally at the same level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an ionizing device <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is affixed to the housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The ionizing device <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is positioned upon the housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to contact the conductive elements <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The ionizing device <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is formed from a conductive material such as, for example, steel or an equivalent, and therefore generally derives the same electrical potential as that of the conductive element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> As best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 through 4</cross-reference>, the ionizing device <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> includes a halo <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> spaced from, and concentrically aligned with the axis of the spray head <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. A pair of support arms <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> affix the halo to a band <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. A plurality of generally conical members <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are affixed to the halo <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, the purpose of which will be explained further below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The band includes a clamping element <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> used to tighten the band <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> around the housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> thereby affixing the ionizing device <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to the apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In the preferred embodiment, the clamping element includes opposing tabs <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> spaced by a gap <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> in the band <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. A fastener <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) is inserted through the tabs <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to narrow the gap <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> in the band <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and tighten the band <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> around the housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The band <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is positioned to contact the conductive elements <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> on the housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The conductive elements <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> as a conductive band <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> that circumscribes the housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>, the conductive elements <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> comprise a conductive rim <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> having a plurality of protuberances <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> disposed thereon. In this embodiment, the band <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> contacts the protuberances <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> deriving the ionizing electrical potential in that manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, each of the generally conical members <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> includes a threaded shaft <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. The threaded shaft <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is used to affix the generally conical member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to the halo <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the generally conical member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> will be permanently affixed to the halo <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> with adhesive, welding, or the like preventing the generally conical member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> from being removed from the halo <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Therefore, it is not necessary that the generally conical member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> include a threaded shaft as alternative methods of attachment may be used as will be appreciated by those of skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>, a shroud <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> covers each of the generally conical members <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Each of the generally conical members <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> includes a tip <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> that protrudes through the shroud <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. A shaping surface <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is disposed upon each shroud <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> having the tip <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of the generally conical member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> centrally located therein. Each shroud <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> includes a pair of snapping arms <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> that secure the shroud <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to the halo <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The shroud <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is preferably formed from Teflon and is generally non-conductive. However, other equivalent non-conductive materials may also be used to form the shroud <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The ionic lines that generate the ionic field around the atomized coating materials emanate from the tip <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of the generally conical members. The shaping surface <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> on each shroud <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> helps shape the ionic lines into an ionic field capable of shaping the dispersion pattern of the coating material. Each tip <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is preferably pointed. The pointed tips <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> have proven to improve the transfer efficiency from the spray head <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to the object to be painted by generally 5%. However, some test data has shown the transfer efficiency has been approved by up to 11%. The pointed tips <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> have proven to be most effective for improving transfer efficiency. However, other shapes such as rounded tips and spherical tips have also proved effective. Generally, the shape of a tip <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> can be tuned to meet the transfer efficiency needs of the object being painted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Preferably, for heads having diameters between 40 and 70 mm, each tip <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is spaced behind the spray head <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> from &frac34; to 1 &frac12; inches. More preferably, each tip <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is spaced behind the spray head <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> a distance of 1 inch or slightly less. The shroud <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is generally shaped as a bell and has a base diameter of approximately &frac58; inches at the halo <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. At the tip <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, the shroud <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> has a tip diameter of approximately 1 inch. The shroud <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> extends past the tip <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> a distance of approximately &frac14; inch. The dimensions listed above are correlated to the diameter of the spray head and can be modified according the diameter of the spray head. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The invention has been described in an illustrative manner, and it is to be understood that the terminology which has been used is intended to be in the nature of words of description rather than of limitation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Obviously, many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. It is, therefore, to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims, wherein reference numerals are merely for convenience and are not to be in any way limiting, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described. </paragraph>
