<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to security systems that regulate access to secure areas, and more particularly, to a security badge that is attached to the authorized person and resets itself when removed from that individual. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> To simplify the following discussion, the present invention will be explained in terms of security systems for use in accessing computers and the like; however, it will be apparent from the following discussion that the present invention may be utilized in other security systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Computer systems having access to a network typically utilize some form of access control to assure that unauthorized individuals do not gain access to confidential information or do damage to the network and/or computers connected thereto. The secure access protocols often require a user to memorize multiple passwords and protocols. For example, the user may need a first password to log onto a terminal in the network, a set of different passwords corresponding to the various servers in the networks or secure directories within a server, and yet another set of passwords relating to various software programs and related files. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Electronic identification cards have been used to automate the logon and access control processes. Such systems sense a personal identification presented by the user. The card can be in the form of a radio frequency identification (RFID) card which is sensed remotely by the computer terminal or a card that is passed through a reader by the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> While such cards can be used to automate the logon process, they do not provide sufficient security to satisfy the needs of many systems. The authenticity of the card can, in principle, be verified by the system that queries the card; however, the system cannot necessarily identify the person presenting the card. An unauthorized person who has gained control of such a card can still access the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In principle, the computer terminal can be equipped with hardware that also allows it to authenticate the person presenting the card. In fact, if the person can be identified directly, then an identification card is not needed. Identification systems based on retinal scans, voiceprints, and fingerprints are well known in the art. This hardware would need to be present at each of the terminals. The cost of providing such hardware at each terminal is often prohibitive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Even in those situations in which identification hardware is provided at each terminal, the system must still deal with interruptions that occur when the user leaves the terminal for a brief period of time. Consider the case of a user who has logged onto a terminal using some form of personal identification system. If the user leaves the terminal without logging off, an unauthorized user can gain access to the system through the open terminal. Hence, the terminal must have some method for determining that the authorized user remains present at the terminal after the logon. For example, an RFID card worn by the user can be queried periodically to determine that the user is still at the terminal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> If the authorized user breaks contact with the terminal, either because the user left the terminal for a short period of time or because the monitoring system failed to detect the person on one of the periodic queries, the terminal needs to disable itself. When the user again makes contact with the terminal, the logon process must be repeated. A logon process that verifies the identity of the user through fingerprints, retinal scans, etc. requires a relatively long procedure. Hence, such systems are frustrating to use, since a user who turns away from the computer or crosses the room to get a document can be forced to repeat the entire logon protocol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Systems based on personal identification cards also present logistical problems for the users and system operators. In such systems, each user is provided with an identification card that must be presented to the system to gain authorization. The card is assigned to the particular user. To guard against an unauthorized person gaining control of the card, the assigned person usually takes the card home at night. If the user leaves the badge at home or loses the badge, the user must go through an often lengthy process of obtaining a new badge or some form of temporary badge in the case in which the user has left his or her badge at home. In addition, the system must provide one badge for each user who is authorized to use the system, whether or not that person will use the system on any particular day. Hence, the number of security badges that must be maintained can be quite large. Since these badges are typically powered by batteries, the costs of providing and maintaining the badges is significant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Broadly, it is the object of the present invention to provide an improved security badge system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> It is a further object of the present invention to provide a security system that can authenticate a user without requiring expensive personal identification hardware at each work station. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> These and other objects of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description of the invention and the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The present invention is a security badge to be worn by a person seeking access to a secure system. The badge includes a data processor having a non-volatile and a volatile memory, a transceiver, and an attachment sensor. The volatile memory stores information related to a security clearance associated with the person. This information is loaded after the badge is attached to the person. The transceiver sends signals generated by the processor and receives signals specifying operations to be carried out by the badge. These signals include signals that provide the person wearing the badge access to the secure system. Upon detecting the removal of the badge from the wearer, the attachment sensor causes information stored in the volatile memory to be altered such that the person no longer has access to the secure system. The transceiver can utilize optical, electromagnetic or acoustic signals for communicating with the secure system. In one embodiment of the invention, the badge includes a tamper sensor for detecting an alteration in the badge that could allow the contents of the volatile memory to be read and rendering information stored in the volatile memory unreadable when the tamper sensor detects such an alteration. In another embodiment, the badge includes a random number generator for generating random numbers for use in coded transmission between the badge and the secure system. The random number generator may utilize a sensor for sensing an environmental variable that determines the random number sequence generated by the random number generator. In another embodiment of the invention, the badge has low and high power modes, the processor being capable of performing at least one computation in the high power mode that cannot be performed in the low power mode. The processor switches from low power mode to high power mode in response to the transceiver detecting a predetermined signal while in the low power mode. In another embodiment of the invention, the attachment sensor includes an attachment mechanism and a position sensor. The attachment mechanism has an open position and a closed position. The attachment mechanism secures the badge to the person in the closed position. The position sensor monitors the state of the attachment mechanism.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The manner in which the present invention provides its advantages may be more easily understood with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, which is a schematic drawing of a system for securing access to a computer system having terminals shown at <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Access to the system is provided by a badge <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> that is worn by a user <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> who wishes to gain access. Badge <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is affixed to the user in a manner in which the removal of badge <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> after it has been affixed can be detected by the badge. For example, badge <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> can be placed around the neck of user <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> via a cord <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> that includes a clasp <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Cord <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is short enough to guarantee that the badge cannot be removed from the neck of the wearer without undoing clasp <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> or breaking cord <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Badge <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> has a sensor that detects the opening of clasp <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> or the breakage of cord <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. For example, cord <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may include a conducting fiber whose continuity is sensed by badge <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. When clasp <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is opened, this conductive path is broken. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> To gain access to the computer system, user <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> puts on badge <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and approaches terminal <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, which loads the information into badge <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> needed for the user to access one or more of the other workstations in the network. Terminal <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> includes a user identification system <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> that is utilized to verify the identity of user <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Identification system <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may include physical sensors such as those needed to make a voice print, retinal scan, or fingerprint scan. The identification system may also include a database having information known only to user <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which may be utilized in generating queries that only user <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> would know how to answer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Once the identity of user <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has been established by terminal <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, terminal <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> loads information into badge <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> that is utilized by badge <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in subsequent communications with the other terminals in the system. To simplify the following discussion, it will be assumed that the various terminals communicate with badge <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> via infra-red signals that are sent and received by the transceivers shown at <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. As will be explained in more detail below, this information is loaded using an encryption system that assures that an eavesdropper cannot gain access to the stored information in a manner that would allow the eavesdropper to communicate with the various terminals in the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In addition to loading the various clearances associated with user <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a &ldquo;day secret&rdquo; is also loaded in badge <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The day secret is a code that changes each day and is known to all of the workstations. Since the code changes from day to day, the permissions granted to user <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, in effect, expire each day. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Once badge <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> has been loaded with the various security clearances assigned to user <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, user <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can approach the terminals that are authorized to serve user <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> such as terminal <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and gain access thereto. Each terminal includes a transceiver that queries the identification badges. When a terminal detects a valid badge that has permission to use that terminal, the terminal allows the user to log onto the terminal and communicates the user&apos;s various clearances to the servers within the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The terminal in question periodically queries badge <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to assure that the user is still at the terminal. If the terminal loses contact with the badge, the terminal covers any material on the display with a &ldquo;screen saver&rdquo; display and enters a first locked mode. During this mode, the terminal periodically sends out query signals. If the badge returns, the terminal utilizes an abbreviated logon dialog to verify the user and returns the display to the condition at the time communication was originally lost. If the user is absent for more than a first predetermined time period, the terminal enters a second locked mode which requires a more extensive logon protocol to return control to the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Having provided the above outline of the operation of a security system according to the present invention, a more detailed description of the operation of the badges and the communication protocols will now be given. Refer now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, which is a block diagram of one embodiment of a badge <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> according to the present invention. Badge <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> includes a processor <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> that utilizes a non-volatile memory <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to store the operating system utilized by the processor. Badge <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> also includes a user certificate volatile memory <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> that is used to store the &ldquo;permissions&rdquo; granted to the user and other information needed to gain and maintain access to a terminal. Badge <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is also assumed to hold an identification number that is stored in the non-volatile memory of the badge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Badge <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> utilizes a transceiver <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to communicate with the various computer terminals. Transceiver <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may utilize any form of communication link to communicate with the computer terminals in the system. In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, transceiver <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> utilizes an infra-red link; however, communication links based on radio frequency signals or ultra-sound may also be utilized. Infra-red or RF links are preferred because they impose the lowest power requirements on badge <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> which is typically powered by a battery. Infra-red links have the added advantage of assuring that the badge will only respond if it is near a terminal and properly oriented with respect thereto. In contrast, RF links tend to be omnidirectional, and RF signals can pass through many types of walls. Hence, a terminal cannot be assured that the badge wearer is nearby without some other form of badge localization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In addition, badge <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> has a sensor <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> that detects a break in the continuity of cord <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Whenever sensor <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> detects a break in cord <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, processor <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> erases the contents of memory <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. Similarly, if power is lost, the contents of memory <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> are lost. Badge <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> can also be equipped with other forms of &ldquo;tamper&rdquo; sensors, such as sensor <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, that cause the contents of memory <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> to be lost if someone attempts to open the badge or otherwise gain access to the contents of memory <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. Hence, badge <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is automatically reset whenever it is removed, loses power, or subjected to tampering. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As will be explained in more detail below, badge <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> preferably includes a random number generator <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> that provides the random numbers utilized in the various secure communications protocols. Pseudo-random number generators based on computer computations that start from a &ldquo;seed&rdquo; are known to the art and may be utilized when the highest degree of security is not needed. However, in the preferred embodiment of the present invention, random number generator <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> utilizes one or more environmental sensors to generate the random numbers provided by generator <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> in a manner that cannot be predicted even by observing the previously generated random numbers provided by generator <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. Unpredictable random number sources can be based on temperature sensors or noise signals generated by resistors or other circuit components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The affixation of the badge to the user prior to the badge being loaded by terminal <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can be verified by security personnel stationed at a point that all users must pass before reaching terminal <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Such verification prevents a user from closing clasp <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> when the badge is not affixed to the user and then presenting himself and the badge to terminal <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> for loading. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> As noted above, the communications between the various terminals and badge <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> must be secure from eavesdropping. Data encryption protocols for securing such communications are well known to those skilled in the art, and hence, will not be discussed in detail here. For the purposes of this discussion, it will be assumed that terminal <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and each badge have a protocol that allows terminal <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and each badge to generate a &ldquo;secret&rdquo;, denoted by &ldquo;k&rdquo; that is known only to terminal <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the particular badge in question. The value of k is determined by protocols that depend on the random numbers generated by generator <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. For example, the elliptic curve version of the Diffie-Hellman protocol may be utilized to generate such a secret. The reader is directed to &ldquo;Handbook of Applied Cryptography&rdquo; by Menezes, van Oorschot, and Vanstone (CRC Press, 1997, and to Elliptic Curves in Cryptography by Blake, Seroussi, and Smart, Cambridge University Press, 2000) for a more detailed discussion of various communication algorithms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Consider a hospital setting in which controlled access to confidential records such as patient treatment records is to be provided to the clinicians while protecting the confidentiality of those records. Each clinician wears a badge similar to those described above. The badge is filled with the clinician&apos;s identity information, denoted by Cred, in the following discussion. This information is stored in the volatile memory of the badge as discussed above. In particular, the badge will automatically erase Cred and become inactive as soon as the badge is detached from the clinician to which it is assigned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The badge is activated by the action of physically attaching the badge to a clinician and running an authentication protocol between the badge and an administrative computer such as terminal <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> discussed above. During the activation protocol, the administrative computer will verify the clinician&apos;s identity by scanning the clinician&apos;s retina. At the end of the authentication protocol, the badge will be loaded with Cred and thereby activated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> While being active (i.e., remaining worn by the clinician), the badge will be able to establish secure sessions of communications with one or more of the clinician&apos;s computers (denoted C) whenever the clinician faces the computer and is within the range of an infra-red communication link constructed from ports on C and the badge. These secure sessions of communications between the badge and C are part of a second protocol, referred to as the records protocol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the badge power supply is very limited; hence, the system is preferably setup in a manner that minimizes the demands on the badge power supply. In addition to performing the various communication protocols, the badge must be able to detect the presence of the administrative computer and C computers. In addition, the badge must be capable of signaling its continued presence to these computers during interactions with them. In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the badge has a &ldquo;dormant&rdquo; state in which the badge listens for signals on the communication link and &ldquo;wakes up&rdquo; when a signal that needs a response is detected. With the exception of this listening activity and other housekeeping functions such as providing power to the volatile memory and tamper detection circuitry, the other power consuming functions of the badge are turned off in the dormant state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The badge enters the dormant state after it is attached to the user. The administrative computer is programmed such that its transceiver sends out a periodic login signal indicating that it is ready to activate a badge. This login signal is one of the signals that the badge is programmed to detect in the dormant state. When the wearer approaches the computer, her badge detects this login signal and wakes up for the activation protocol in which the badge is loaded with Cred and activated such that the wearer can log onto a C computer. Once the activation protocol is completed, the badge again returns to the dormant state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Each of the C computers likewise sends out a periodic login signal when that computer is free and ready to login a new user. This second login signal is also one of the signals detected by the badge in the dormant state. When the badge wearer approaches the C computer, the badge detects the login signal and switches from the dormant state to engage in the login protocol discussed below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> At the end of the C computer login protocol, the C computer transceiver is programmed to send a third signal that is recognized by the badge in the dormant state. This signal is used to verify that the user is still at the terminal. The badge is programmed to respond to this signal by sending a specific acknowledgment signal in return. This communication can be part of the dormant state operations or part of a second low power state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> If a badge does not acknowledge the verification signal described above, the C computer initiates a re-login procedure by sending a fourth signal that is recognized by the badge in the dormant or low power state. This signal is repeated until the badge responds accordingly or a predetermined period of time elapses. If the badge responds according to that protocol, the C computer resumes the verification signal. If the badge does not respond appropriately, the user is logged off of the terminal, and the C computer enters the mode in which it sends the C computer login signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The badge is capable of performing the less computationally intensive public-key encryption operations such as elliptic-curve point multiplication and generating the hash function SHA-1 utilized in the Secure Hash Standard as published in the Federal Register. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The level of security needed in the interchange between the administrative computer and the badge wearer depends on the level of security surrounding the administrative computer and the degree of honesty of the badge wearer. For example, if the badge wearer can be assumed to be honest, then the system does not need to guard against the wearer recording the exchange. This leaves only the possibility that a third party will eavesdrop on the exchange between the badge and the terminal. If the administrative computer is in a location that is secured with respect to such eavesdropping, the exchange need not be encrypted at all. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> If, on the other hand, the badge wearer cannot be trusted, then an encryption protocol that is immune from eavesdropping must be utilized. In this case, any suitable public or private key encryption system may be used by the computers and the badges to develop a key for later use in encrypting messages. If a private key system is utilized, the system must be arranged in a manner that guarantees that the key cannot be extracted from the badge. For example, the badge can include tamper sensors that erase the key information if tampering is detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Similarly, the level of security needed in the exchanges between the C computers and the badge depend on the value of the information and the trustworthiness of the wearer. In general, the badge and the C computer must authenticate each other, since it is assumed that the C computers are not secure. If, however, the C computers are secure, then only the badge needs to be authenticated by the C computer. The level of security needed to assure privacy with respect to the communications between the badge and the C computer again depends on the ease with which these communications can be monitored. If there is a possibility of eavesdropping, then a suitable public or private key encryption system must be utilized in the authentication exchange. Similarly, the secondary protocol utilized at the C computers to reestablish a lost link with a badge can be replaced by any suitably secure protocol that is less computationally intensive that the login protocol used to commence the session between a badge wearer and C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> As noted above, the system can utilize any type of transceiver to generate the communication link between the badge and the relevant computer terminals. Infra-red sensors are preferred, however, because such sensors require relatively low power and provide increased security over other types of communication links such as RF links. An eavesdropper can monitor an RF signal from a location outside of the cubical or room in which the badge and terminal are operating. In contrast, light-based systems require the eavesdropper to have a clear line of sight to both the terminal and badge transceivers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The above-described embodiments of the present invention utilized a sensor in an attachment cord to detect the removal of the badge from the person&apos;s body. However, other mechanisms for sensing the removal of the badge from the wearer can be utilized for this function. Any form of sensor that provides a signal when the badge is removed from the user can be utilized. For example, the badge can be attached to the wearer&apos;s clothing via a clip that can detect the opening thereof. When the clip is opened, the badge resets itself to the inactive state. Similarly, the badge can be incorporated into a wrist band that has an expandable band that provides a signal to the badge when the band expands sufficiently to allow it to be removed from the wearer&apos;s wrist. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In addition, embodiments in which the badge utilizes some form of biometric measurement to assure that the badge is still on the authorized individual&apos;s body can be constructed. Sensor&apos;s that detect body heat or pulse can be utilized for this function. Such sensors may be included in wristwatch-like embodiments of the invention in which the sensor is pressed against the wrist of the user when the badge is worn by the user. If the badge is removed, the temperature will decrease or the pulse signal will be lost. If the badge is carried in the person&apos;s wallet, a light sensor can be used to detect the removal of the badge from the wallet. Accordingly, break sensor <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> can be replaced by any sensor that detects the removal of the badge from the wearer. Similarly, cord <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and clasp <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> can be replaced by any attachment mechanism that provides a signal indicating that the badge has been removed from the wearer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The above-described embodiments of the present invention assume that the authentication of the wearer is performed by equipment attached to an administrative computer. However, embodiments in which authentication hardware is part of the badge itself can also be practiced. For example, the badge may include an identification sensor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> such as a fingerprint scanner. In such an embodiment, memory <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> would also store a file of authorized fingerprints. In such an embodiment, the fingerprint scanner would be enabled when the controller in the badge detects the attachment of the badge to the wearer. Similarly, the badge may include a microphone that is used to record the voiceprint of the user after the badge is attached to the user. The detected voiceprint would then be compared to a library of voiceprints to verify the identity of the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The recognition work can also be split between the badge and the computer terminals. For example, the biometric identification hardware such as the fingerprint scanner, microphone, pulse detector, or temperature detector can be part of the badge. The measurements made by these elements would then be communicated to the computer terminal. The computer terminal would then compare the received measurements with data identifying the various authorized users. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> While the above-described embodiments of the sensors for detecting the removal of the badge from the wearer have utilized a single attachment sensor, a combination of several sensors can also be utilized. For example, an attachment sensor constructed from a combination of sensors that detect both the temperature and pulse of the wearer can provide increased security. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Similarly, a combination of measurements can be utilized to increase the confidence level of the user identification process. For example, both a fingerprint and a series of questions posed to the wearer can be utilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the badges of the present invention are not permanently associated with particular individuals, and hence, an employee does not need to take his or her badge home. The badges can be picked up from a big basket near station A when needed and thrown back to the basket at the end of the day. Hence, the costs and inconvenience associated with losing or damaging a badge are significantly reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Various modifications to the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the foregoing description and accompanying drawings. Accordingly, the present invention is to be limited solely by the scope of the following claims. </paragraph>
