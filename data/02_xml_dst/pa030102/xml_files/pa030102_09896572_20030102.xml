<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to the manufacturing of supports having bound to the surfaces thereof a plurality of chemical compounds such as polymers, which are prepared on the surface in a series of steps. More particularly, the present invention relates to methods for solid phase chemical synthesis, particularly solid phase synthesis of oligomer arrays, or attachment of oligonucleotides and polynucleotides to surfaces, e.g., arrays of polynucleotides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In the field of diagnostics and therapeutics, it is often useful to attach species to a surface. One important application is in solid phase chemical synthesis wherein initial derivatization of a substrate surface enables synthesis of polymers such as oligonucleotides and peptides on the substrate itself. Support bound oligomer arrays, particularly oligonucleotide arrays, may be used in screening studies for determination of binding affinity. Modification of surfaces for use in chemical synthesis has been described. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,624,711 (Sundberg), U.S. Pat. No. 5,266,222 (Willis) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,137,765 (Farnsworth). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Determining the nucleotide sequences and expression levels of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) is critical to understanding the function and control of genes and their relationship, for example, to disease discovery and disease management. Analysis of genetic information plays a crucial role in biological experimentation. This has become especially true with regard to studies directed at understanding the fundamental genetic and environmental factors associated with disease and the effects of potential therapeutic agents on the cell. Such a determination permits the early detection of infectious organisms such as bacteria, viruses, etc.; genetic diseases such as sickle cell anemia; and various cancers. This paradigm shift has lead to an increasing need within the life science industries for more sensitive, more accurate and higher-throughput technologies for performing analysis on genetic material obtained from a variety of biological sources. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Unique or misexpressed nucleotide sequences in a polynucleotide can be detected by hybridization with a nucleotide multimer, or oligonucleotide, probe. Hybridization is based on complementary base pairing. When complementary single stranded nucleic acids are incubated together, the complementary base sequences pair to form double stranded hybrid molecules. These techniques rely upon the inherent ability of nucleic acids to form duplexes via hydrogen bonding according to Watson-Crick base-pairing rules. The ability of single stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (ssDNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA) to form a hydrogen bonded structure with a complementary nucleic acid sequence has been employed as an analytical tool in molecular biology research. An oligonucleotide probe employed in the detection is selected with a nucleotide sequence complementary, usually exactly complementary, to the nucleotide sequence in the target nucleic acid. Following hybridization of the probe with the target nucleic acid, any oligonucleotide probe/nucleic acid hybrids that have formed are typically separated from unhybridized probe. The amount of oligonucleotide probe in either of the two separated media is then tested to provide a qualitative or quantitative measurement of the amount of target nucleic acid originally present. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Direct detection of labeled target nucleic acid hybridized to surface-bound polynucleotide probes is particularly advantageous if the surface contains a mosaic of different probes that are individually localized to discrete, known areas of the surface. Such ordered arrays containing a large number of oligonucleotide probes have been developed as tools for high throughput analyses of genotype and gene expression. Oligonucleotides synthesized on a solid support recognize uniquely complementary nucleic acids by hybridization, and arrays can be designed to define specific target sequences, analyze gene expression patterns or identify specific allelic variations. The arrays may be used for conducting cell study, for diagnosing disease, identifying gene expression, monitoring drug response, determination of viral load, identifying genetic polymorphisms, analyze gene expression patterns or identify specific allelic variations, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In one approach, cell matter is lysed, to release its DNA as fragments, which are then separated out by electrophoresis or other means, and then tagged with a fluorescent or other label. The resulting DNA mix is exposed to an array of oligonucleotide probes, whereupon selective binding to matching probe sites takes place. The array is then washed and interrogated to determine the extent of hybridization reactions. In one approach the array is imaged so as to reveal for analysis and interpretation the sites where binding has occurred. Arrays of different chemical probe species provide methods of highly parallel detection, and hence improved speed and efficiency, in assays. Assuming that the different sequence polynucleotides were correctly deposited in accordance with the predetermined configuration, then the observed binding pattern will be indicative of the presence and/or concentration of one or more polynucleotide components of the sample. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The arrays may be microarrays created by in-situ synthesis, oligonucleotide deposition or cDNA. In general, arrays are synthesized on a surface of a substrate by one of any number of synthetic techniques that are known in the art. In one approach to the synthesis of microarrays flow cells or flow devices are employed in which a substrate is placed to carry out the synthesis. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The present methods and apparatus may be employed in the synthesis of a plurality of chemical compounds on supports with particular application to such synthesis on a commercial scale. Usually, the chemical compounds are those which are synthesized in a series of steps such as, for example, the addition of building blocks, which are chemical components of the chemical compound. Examples of such building blocks are those found in the synthesis of polymers. The apparatus and methods of the invention employ a plurality of dedicated flow cells, in each of which a different repetitive step in the synthesis of the chemical compounds is conducted. In this way a substantial reduction in cross-contamination is realized and system design is simplified. In one aspect of the invention fluid materials, such as fluid reagents and wash fluids, exiting the flow cell are subjected to examination and/or purification in-line. A determination is made in-line to send the resulting fluid materials to be combined with fresh materials for input into the flow cell or to be sent to a waste container. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, the chemical compounds are those that are synthesized in a series of steps, which usually involve linking together building blocks that form the chemical compound. The invention has particular application to the synthesis of oligomers or polymers. The oligomer or polymer is a chemical entity that contains a plurality of monomers. It is generally accepted that the term &ldquo;oligomers&rdquo; is used to refer to a species of polymers. The terms &ldquo;oligomer&rdquo; and &ldquo;polymer&rdquo; may be used interchangeably herein. Polymers usually comprise at least two monomers. Oligomers generally comprise about 6 to about 20,000 monomers, preferably, about 10 to about 10,000, more preferably about 15 to about 4,000 monomers. Examples of polymers include polydeoxyribonucleotides, polyribonucleotides, other polynucleotides that are C-glycosides of a purine or pyrimidine base, or other modified polynucleotides, polypeptides, polysaccharides, and other chemical entities that contain repeating units of like chemical structure. Exemplary of oligomers are oligonucleotides and peptides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> A monomer is a chemical entity that can be covalently linked to one or more other such entities to form an oligomer or polymer. Examples of monomers include nucleotides, amino acids, saccharides, peptoids, and the like. In general, the monomers have first and second sites (e.g., C-termini and N-termini, or 5&prime; and 3&prime; sites) suitable for binding of other like monomers by means of standard chemical reactions (e.g., condensation, nucleophilic displacement of a leaving group, or the like), and a diverse element that distinguishes a particular monomer from a different monomer of the same type (e.g., an amino acid side chain, a nucleotide base, etc.). The initial substrate-bound monomer is generally used as a building block in a multi-step synthesis procedure to form a complete ligand, such as in the synthesis of oligonucleotides, oligopeptides, oligosaccharides, etc. and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Polynucleotides are compounds or compositions that are polymeric nucleotides or nucleic acid polymers. The polynucleotide may be a natural compound or a synthetic compound. Polynucleotides include oligonucleotides and are comprised of natural nucleotides such as ribonucleotides and deoxyribonucleotides and their derivatives although unnatural nucleotide mimetics such as 2&prime;-modified nucleosides, peptide nucleic acids and oligomeric nucleoside phosphonates are also used. The polynucleotide can have from about 2 to 5,000,000 or more nucleotides. Usually, the oligonucleotides are at least about 2 nucleotides, preferably, about 5 to about 100 nucleotides, more preferably, about 10 to about 50 nucleotides, and usually, about 15 to about 30 nucleotides, in length. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The support to which a plurality of chemical compounds is attached is usually a porous or non-porous water insoluble material. The support can have any one of a number of shapes, such as strip, plate, disk, rod, particle, and the like. The support can be hydrophilic or capable of being rendered hydrophilic or it may be hydrophobic. The support is usually glass such as flat glass whose surface has been chemically activated to support binding or synthesis thereon, glass available as Bioglass and the like. However, the support may be made from materials such as inorganic powders, e.g., silica, magnesium sulfate, and alumina; natural polymeric materials, particularly cellulosic materials and materials derived from cellulose, such as fiber containing papers, e.g., filter paper, chromatographic paper, etc.; synthetic or modified naturally occurring polymers, such as nitrocellulose, cellulose acetate, poly (vinyl chloride), polyacrylamide, cross linked dextran, agarose, polyacrylate, polyethylene, polypropylene, poly(4-methylbutene), polystyrene, polymethacrylate, poly(ethylene terephthalate), nylon, poly(vinyl butyrate), etc.; either used by themselves or in conjunction with other materials; ceramics, metals, and the like. Preferably, for packaged arrays the support is a non-porous material such as glass, plastic, metal and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The surface of a support is normally treated to create a primed or functionalized surface, that is, a surface that is able to support the synthetic steps involved in the production of the chemical compound. Functionalization relates to modification of the surface of a support to provide a plurality of functional groups on the support surface. By the term &ldquo;functionalized surface&rdquo; is meant a support surface that has been modified so that a plurality of functional groups are present thereon. The manner of treatment is dependent on the nature of the chemical compound to be synthesized and on the nature of the support surface. In one approach a reactive hydrophilic site or reactive hydrophilic group is introduced onto the surface of the support. Such hydrophilic moieties can be used as the starting point in a synthetic organic process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the surface of the support, such as a glass support, is siliceous, i.e., comprises silicon oxide groups, either present in the natural state, e.g., glass, silica, silicon with an oxide layer, etc., or introduced by techniques well known in the art. One technique for introducing siloxyl groups onto the surface involves reactive hydrophilic moieties on the surface. These moieties are typically epoxide groups, carboxyl groups, thiol groups, and/or substituted or unsubstituted amino groups as well as a functionality that may be used to introduce such a group such as, for example, an olefin that may be converted to a hydroxyl group by means well known in the art. One approach is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,474,796 (Brennan), the relevant portions of which are incorporated herein by reference. A siliceous surface may be used to form silyl linkages, i.e., linkages that involve silicon atoms. Usually, the silyl linkage involves a silicon-oxygen bond, a silicon-halogen bond, a silicon-nitrogen bond, or a silicon-carbon bond. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> A procedure for the derivatization of a metal oxide surface uses an aminoalkyl silane derivative, e.g., trialkoxy 3-aminopropylsilane such as aminopropyltriethoxy silane (APS), 4-aminobutyltrimethoxysilane, 4-aminobutyltriethoxysilane, 2-aminoethyltriethoxysilane, and the like. APS reacts readily with the oxide and/or siloxyl groups on metal and silicon surfaces. APS provides primary amine groups that may be used to carry out the present methods. Such a derivatization procedure is described in EP 0 173 356 B1, the relevant portions of which are incorporated herein by reference. Other methods for treating the surface of a support will be suggested to those skilled in the art in view of the teaching herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The apparatus and methods of the present invention are particularly useful in the synthesis of arrays of biopolymers. A biopolymer is a polymer of one or more types of repeating units relating to biology. Biopolymers are typically found in biological systems (although they may be made synthetically) and particularly include polysaccharides such as carbohydrates and the like, poly(amino acids) such as peptides including polypeptides and proteins, and polynucleotides, as well as such compounds composed of or containing amino acid analogs or non-amino acid groups, or nucleotide analogs or non-nucleotide groups. This includes polynucleotides in which the conventional backbone has been replaced with a non-naturally occurring or synthetic backbone, and nucleic acids (or synthetic or naturally occurring analogs) in which one or more of the conventional bases has been replaced with a group (natural or synthetic) capable of participating in Watson-Crick type hydrogen bonding interactions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> An array includes any one, two or three dimensional arrangement of addressable regions bearing a particular chemical moiety or moieties such as, for example, biopolymers, e.g., one or more polynucleotides, associated with that region. An array is addressable in that it has multiple regions of different moieties, for example, different polynucleotide sequences, such that a region or feature or spot of the array at a particular predetermined location or address on the array can detect a particular target molecule or class of target molecules although a feature may incidentally detect non-target molecules of that feature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The present methods and apparatus may be used in the synthesis of polypeptides. The synthesis of polypeptides involves the sequential addition of amino acids to a growing peptide chain. This approach comprises attaching an amino acid to the functionalized surface of the support. In one approach the synthesis involves sequential addition of carboxyl-protected amino acids to a growing peptide chain with each additional amino acid in the sequence similarly protected and coupled to the terminal amino acid of the oligopeptide under conditions suitable for forming an amide linkage. Such conditions are well known to the skilled artisan. See, for example, Merrifield, B. (1986), Solid Phase Synthesis, <highlight><italic>Sciences </italic></highlight>232, 341-347. After polypeptide synthesis is complete, acid is used to remove the remaining terminal protecting groups. In accordance with the present invention each of certain repetitive steps involved in the addition of an amino acid is carried out in a different flow cell that is dedicated to that repetitive step. Such repetitive steps may involve, among others, washing of the surface, protection and deprotection of certain functionalities on the surface, oxidation or reduction of functionalities on the surface, and so forth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The apparatus and methods of the present invention are particularly useful in the synthesis of oligonucleotide arrays for determinations of polynucleotides. In the field of bioscience, arrays of oligonucleotide probes, fabricated or deposited on a surface of a support, are used to identify DNA sequences in cell matter. The arrays generally involve a surface containing a mosaic of different oligonucleotides or sample nucleic acid sequences or polynucleotides that are individually localized to discrete, known areas of the surface. In one approach, multiple identical arrays across a complete front surface of a single substrate or support are used. However, the arrays produced on a given substrate need not be identical and some or all could be different. Each array may contain multiple spots or features and each array may be separated by spaces. Each feature, or element, within the molecular array is defined to be a small, regularly shaped region of the surface of the substrate. The features are arranged in a regular pattern. Each feature within the molecular array may contain a different molecular species, and the molecular species within a given feature may differ from the molecular species within the remaining features of the molecular array. A typical array may contain from about 100 to about 100,000 or more features. All of the features may be different, or some or all may be the same. Each feature may carry a predetermined polynucleotide having a particular sequence or a predetermined mixture of polynucleotides. While arrays may be separated from one another by spaces, and the features may be separated from one another by spaces, such spaces in either instance are not essential. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Ordered arrays containing a large number of oligonucleotides have been developed as tools for high throughput analyses of genotype and gene expression. Oligonucleotides synthesized on a solid support recognize uniquely complementary nucleic acids by hybridization, and arrays can be designed to define specific target sequences, analyze gene expression patterns or identify specific allelic variations. The arrays may be used for conducting cell study, for diagnosing disease, identifying gene expression, monitoring drug response, determination of viral load, identifying genetic polymorphisms, analyze gene expression patterns or identify specific allelic variations, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The synthesis of arrays of polynucleotides on the surface of a support usually involves attaching an initial nucleoside or nucleotide to a functionalized surface. The surface may be functionalized as discussed above. In one approach the surface is reacted with nucleosides or nucleotides that are also functionalized for reaction with the groups on the surface of the support. Methods for introducing appropriate amine specific or alcohol specific reactive functional groups into a nucleoside or nucleotide include, by way of example, addition of a spacer amine containing phosphoramidites, addition on the base of alkynes or alkenes using palladium mediated coupling, addition of spacer amine containing activated carbonyl esters, addition of boron conjugates, formation of Schiff bases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> After the introduction of the nucleoside or nucleotide onto the surface, the attached nucleotide may be used to construct the polynucleotide by means well known in the art. For example, in the synthesis of arrays of oligonucleotides, nucleoside monomers are generally employed. In this embodiment an array of the above compounds is attached to the surface and each compound is reacted to attach a nucleoside. Nucleoside monomers are used to form the polynucleotides usually by phosphate coupling, either direct phosphate coupling or coupling using a phosphate precursor such as a phosphite coupling. Such coupling thus includes the use of amidite (phosphoramidite), phosphodiester, phosphotriester, H-phosphonate, phosphite halide, and the like coupling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> One preferred coupling method is phosphoramidite coupling, which is a phosphite coupling. In using this coupling method, after the phosphite coupling is complete, the resulting phosphite is oxidized to a phosphate. Oxidation can be effected with iodine to give phosphates or with sulfur to give phosphorothioates. The phosphoramidites are dissolved in anhydrous acetonitrile to give a solution having a given ratio of amidite concentrations. The mixture of known chemically compatible monomers is reacted to a solid support, or further along, may be reacted to a growing chain of monomer units. In one particular example, the terminal 5&prime;-hydroxyl group is caused to react with a deoxyribonucleoside-3&prime;-O-(N,N-diisopropylamino)phosphoramidite protected at the 5&prime;-position with dimethoxytrityl or the like. The 5&prime; protecting group is removed after the coupling reaction, and the procedure is repeated with additional protected nucleotides until synthesis of the desired polynucleotide is complete. For a more detailed discussion of the chemistry involved in the above synthetic approaches, see, for example, U.S. Pat.

<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Various ways may be employed to introduce the reagents for producing an array of polynucleotides on the surface of a support such as a glass support. Such methods are known in the art. One such method is discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,744,305 (Fodor, et al.) and involves solid phase chemistry, photolabile protecting groups and photolithography. Binary masking techniques are employed in one embodiment of the above. Arrays are fabricated in situ, adding one base pair at a time to a primer site. Photolithography is used to uncover sites, which are then exposed and reacted with one of the four base pair phosphoramidites. In photolithography the surface is first coated with a light-sensitive resist, exposed through a mask and the pattern is revealed by dissolving away the exposed or the unexposed resist and, subsequently, a surface layer. A separate mask is usually made for each pattern, which may involve four patterns for each base pair in the length of the probe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Another in situ method employs inkjet printing technology to dispense the appropriate phosphoramidite reagents and other reagents onto individual sites on a surface of a support. Oligonucleotides are synthesized on a surface of a substrate in situ using phosphoramidite chemistry. Solutions containing nucleotide monomers and other reagents as necessary such as an activator, e.g., tetrazole, are applied to the surface of a support by means of thermal ink-jet technology. Individual droplets of reagents are applied to reactive areas on the surface using, for example, a thermal inkjet type nozzle. The surface of the support may have an alkyl bromide trichlorosilane coating to which is attached polyethylene glycol to provide terminal hydroxyl groups. These hydroxyl groups provide for linking to a terminal primary amine group on a monomeric reagent. Excess of non-reacted chemical on the surface is washed away in a subsequent step. For example, see U.S. Pat. No. 5,700,637 and PCT WO 95/25116 and PCT application WO 89/10977. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Other methods for synthesizing arrays of oligonucleotide on a surface include those disclosed by Gamble, et al., WO97/44134; Gamble, et al., WO98/10858; Baldeschwieler, et al., WO95/25116; Brown, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,807,522; and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In general, in the above synthetic steps involving monomer addition such as, for example, the phosphoramidite method, there are certain repetitive steps such as washing the surface of the support prior to or after a reaction, oxidation of substances such as oxidation of a phosphite group to a phosphate group, removal of protecting groups, blocking of sites to prevent reaction at such site, capping of sites that did not react with a phosphoramidite reagent, deblocking, and so forth. In addition, under certain circumstances other reactions may be carried out in a flow cell such as, for example, phosphoramidite monomer addition, modified phosphoramidite addition, other monomer additions, addition of a polymer chain to a surface for linking to monomers, and so forth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> For in situ fabrication methods, multiple different reagent droplets are deposited by pulse jet or other means at a given target location in order to form the final feature (hence a probe of the feature is synthesized on the array substrate). The in situ fabrication methods include those described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,449,754 for synthesizing peptide arrays, and in U.S. Pat. No. 6,180,351 and WO 98/41531 and the references cited therein for polynucleotides, and may also use pulse jets for depositing reagents. The in situ method for fabricating a polynucleotide array typically follows, at each of the multiple different addresses at which features are to be formed, the same conventional iterative sequence used in forming polynucleotides from nucleoside reagents on a support by means of known chemistry. This iterative sequence can be considered as multiple ones of the following attachment cycle at each feature to be formed: (a) coupling an activated selected nucleoside (a monomeric unit) through a phosphite linkage to a functionalized support in the first iteration, or a nucleoside bound to the substrate (i.e. the nucleoside-modified substrate) in subsequent iterations; (b) optionally, blocking unreacted hydroxyl groups on the substrate bound nucleoside (sometimes referenced as &ldquo;capping&rdquo;); (c) oxidizing the phosphite linkage of step (a) to form a phosphate linkage; and (d) removing the protecting group (&ldquo;deprotection&rdquo;) from the now substrate bound nucleoside coupled in step (a), to generate a reactive site for the next cycle of these steps. The coupling can be performed by depositing drops of an activator and phosphoramidite at the specific desired feature locations for the array. Capping, oxidation and deprotection can be accomplished by treating the entire substrate (&ldquo;flooding&rdquo;) with a layer of the appropriate reagent. The functionalized support (in the first cycle) or deprotected coupled nucleoside (in subsequent cycles) provides a substrate bound moiety with a linking group for forming the phosphite linkage with a next nucleoside to be coupled in step (a). Final deprotection of nucleoside bases can be accomplished using alkaline conditions such as ammonium hydroxide, in another flooding procedure in a known manner. Conventionally, a single pulse jet or other dispenser is assigned to deposit a single monomeric unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The foregoing chemistry of the synthesis of polynucleotides is described in detail, for example, in Caruthers, <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>230: 281-285, 1985</bold></highlight>; Itakura, et al., <highlight><italic>Ann. Rev. Biochem. </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>53: 323-356</bold></highlight>; Hunkapillar, et al., <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>310: 105-110, 1984</bold></highlight>; and in &ldquo;Synthesis of Oligonucleotide Derivatives in Design and Targeted Reaction of Oligonucleotide Derivatives&rdquo;, CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fla., pages 100 et seq., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,458,066, 4,500,707, 5,153,319, 5,869,643 and European patent application, EP 0294196, and elsewhere. The phosphoramidite and phosphite triester approaches are most broadly used, but other approaches include the phosphodiester approach, the phosphotriester approach and the H-phosphonate approach. The substrates are typically functionalized to bond to the first deposited monomer. Suitable techniques for functionalizing substrates with such linking moieties are described, for example, in Southern, E. M., Maskos, U. and Elder, J. K., Genomics, <highlight><bold>13, 1007-1017, 1992. </bold></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In the case of array fabrication, different monomers and activator may be deposited at different addresses on the substrate during any one cycle so that the different features of the completed array will have different desired biopolymer sequences. One or more intermediate further steps may be required in each cycle, such as the conventional oxidation, capping and washing steps in the case of in situ fabrication of polynucleotide arrays (again, these steps may be performed in flooding procedure). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the method of the present invention, some or all of the above steps are performed using dedicated flow cells, i.e., a flow cell for each separate distinct step. Accordingly, for example, after addition of a nucleoside monomer, whether using an ink jet method, a photolithography method or the like, the support is placed into a chamber of a first flow cell, which is typically a housing having a reaction cavity or chamber disposed therein. The flow cell allows fluids to be passed through the chamber where the support is disposed. The support is mounted in the chamber in or on a holder. The housing usually further comprises at least one fluid inlet and at least one fluid outlet for flowing fluids into and through the chamber in which the support is mounted. In one approach, the fluid outlet may be used to vent the interior of the reaction chamber for introduction and removal of fluid by means of the inlet. On the other hand, fluids may be introduced into the reaction chamber by means of the inlet with the outlet serving as a vent and fluids may be removed from the reaction chamber by means of the outlet with the inlet serving as a vent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The housing of the flow cell is generally constructed to permit access into the chamber therein. In one approach, the flow cell has an opening that is sealable to fluid transfer after the support is placed therein. Such seals may comprise a flexible material that is sufficiently flexible or compressible to form a fluid tight seal that can be maintained under increased pressures encountered in the use of the device. The flexible member may be, for example, rubber, flexible plastic, flexible resins, and the like and combinations thereof. In any event the flexible material should be substantially inert with respect to the fluids introduced into the device and must not interfere with the reactions that occur within the device. The flexible member is usually a gasket and may be in any shape such as, for example, circular, oval, rectangular, and the like. Preferably, the flexible member is in the form of an O-ring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In another approach the housing of the flow cell may be conveniently constructed in two parts, which may be referred to generally as top and bottom elements. These two elements are sealably engaged during synthetic steps and are separable at other times to permit the support to be placed into and removed from the chamber of the flow cell. Generally, the top element is adapted to be moved with respect to the bottom element although other situations are contemplated herein. Movement of the top element with respect to the bottom element is achieved by means of, for example, pistons, and so forth. The movement is controlled electronically by means that are conventional in the art. In another approach a reagent chamber is formed in situ from a support and a sealing member. The inlet of the flow cell is usually in fluid communication with an element that controls the flow of fluid into the flow cell such as, for example, a manifold, a valve, and the like or combinations thereof. This element in turn is in fluid communication with one or more fluid reagent dispensing stations. In this way different fluid reagents for one step in the synthesis of the chemical compound may be introduced sequentially into the flow cell. These reagents may be, for example, a chemical reagent that forms part of the chemical compound by addition thereto, wash fluids, oxidizing agents, reducing agents, blocking or protecting agents, unblocking (deblocking) or deprotecting agents, and so forth. Any reagent that is normally a solid reagent may be converted to a fluid reagent by dissolution in a suitable solvent, which may be a protic solvent or an aprotic solvent. The solvent may be an organic solvent such as, by way of illustration and not limitation, oxygenated organic solvents of from 1 to about 6, more usually from 1 to about 4, carbon atoms, including alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, etc., ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, ethyl ether, propyl ether, etc., acetonitrile, dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, and the like. The solvent may be an aqueous medium that is solely water or may contain a buffer, or may contain from about 0.01 to about 80 or more volume percent of a cosolvent such as an organic solvent as mentioned above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment the fluid dispensing stations are affixed to a base plate or main platform to which the flow cells are mounted. Any fluid dispensing station may be employed that dispenses fluids such as water, aqueous media, organic solvents and the like. The fluid dispensing station may comprises a pump for moving fluid and may also comprise a valve assembly and a manifold as well as a means for delivering predetermined quantities of fluid to the flow cell. The fluids may be dispensed by pumping from the dispensing station. In this regard any standard pumping technique for pumping fluids may be employed in the present apparatus. For example, pumping may be by means of a peristaltic pump, a pressurized fluid bed, a positive displacement pump, e.g., a syringe pump, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Upon completion of the first step in the synthesis of the chemical compound, the support is removed from the first flow cell and transferred to a second flow cell, which generally has the same or similar configuration as the first flow cell but need not. The support is transported by a transfer element such as a robotic arm, and so forth. In one embodiment a transfer robot is mounted on the main platform of the present apparatus. The transfer robot may comprise a base, an arm that is movably mounted on the base, and an element for grasping the support during transport that is attached to the arm. The element for grasping the support may be, for example, movable finger-like projections, and the like. In use, the robotic arm is activated so that the support is grasped by the above mentioned element. The arm of the robot is moved so that the support is delivered to the second flow cell, which is in the open position so that the support is delivered into the chamber thereof. The second flow cell is operated in substantially the same manner as described above for the first flow cell to carry out a second step in the synthesis of the chemical compound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The support is transferred to additional flow cells to complete the synthesis of the chemical compound. The number of flow cells employed depends on the nature of the synthesis and the nature of the chemical compound to be synthesized. Usually, the number of flow cells is about 2 to about 20, more usually about 4 to about 12. It is within the purview of the present invention that one or more steps in the synthesis process is a repeat of an earlier step because the chemical component that is to be added to the growing molecule is the same as that in a previous step. In this instance the transfer element delivers the support to a flow cell in which the earlier repetitive step was carried out and at which the dispensing stations have the necessary reagents for conducting this step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The amount of the reagents employed in each synthetic step in the method of the present invention is dependent on the nature of the reagents, solubility of the reagents, reactivity of the reagents, availability of the reagents, purity of the reagents, and so forth. Such amounts should be readily apparent to those skilled in the art in view of the disclosure herein. Usually, stoichiometric amounts are employed, but excess of one reagent over the other may be used where circumstances dictate. Typically, the amounts of the reagents are those necessary to achieve the overall synthesis of the chemical compound in accordance with the present invention. The time period for conducting the present method is dependent upon the specific reaction and reagents being utilized and the chemical compound being synthesized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention a different flow cell is employed for each distinct repetitive step. Using as an example the synthesis of polynucleotides on a surface by the phosphoramidite method, the step of oxidation of phosphite to phosphate is carried out in a dedicated flow cell. Accordingly, following addition of a monomer, the support is placed in the flow cell, which is then closed to form a liquid tight seal. Various fluid dispensing stations are connected by means of a manifold and suitable valves to the inlet of the flow cell. Each of the fluid dispensing stations contains a different fluid reagent involved in performing the particular synthetic addition of monomer. Thus, in this example, one station may contain an oxidizing agent for oxidizing the phosphite to the phosphate and another station may contain a wash reagent such as acetonitrile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The wash reagent is first allowed to pass into and out of the flow cell. Next, the oxidizing agent is allowed to pass into and out of the flow cell and the surface is again washed with the wash reagent as described above. The support is then transported from this first flow cell to a second flow cell. At this point, a deblocking reagent for removing a protecting group is allowed to pass into and out of the second flow cell. The deblocking reagent is contained in a fluid dispensing station that is in fluid communication with the second flow cell. Next, wash reagent contained in a fluid dispensing station that is in fluid communication with the second flow cell is passed into and out of the second flow cell. Following the above synthetic steps, the support is transported from the second flow cell to a station where the next monomer addition is carried out and the above repetitive synthetic steps are conducted in the first and second flow cells as discussed above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the present invention fluid exiting the outlet of the flow cell is examined to determine a condition of the fluid such as, for example, the activity of reagents in the fluid, the level of contaminants in the fluid, and so forth. An appropriate sensor is employed to determine the condition of the fluid. The nature of the sensor is dependent on the nature of the fluid reagent and impurities that may be found in the fluid reagent as a result of the reactions that have occurred in the flow cell. The sensor may be, for example, an optical sensor, and the like. The sensor determines whether the fluid reagent has exceeded a predetermined threshold. If the predetermined threshold level is exceeded, at least a portion or all of the fluid reagent is directed to a waste container. If the predetermined threshold level is not exceeded, at least a portion or all of the fluid reagent is recycled into the input stream of the flow cell or is subjected to a purification system. When the fluid reagent is recycled, it is combined with fresh fluid reagent so that the amount of recycle fluid reagent is usually about 10 to about 90%, more usually, about 25 to about 75%, and may be about <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to about 60%, by weight of the resulting mixture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, one or more purification systems may be employed in fluid communication with the outlet of the flow cell and/or with the condition sensor. The nature of the purification system is dependent on the nature of the fluid exiting the flow cell. More particularly, the fluid exiting the flow cell may exhibit a certain condition. For example, the fluid may contain certain impurities or contaminants from the reactions that have occurred in the flow cell. Such impurities may be, for example, ionic or non-ionic, and so forth. The fluid exiting the flow cell may contain reacted or spent reagent or reaction by-products and/or unreacted reagent. The purification systems may comprise a chromatographic column for separation of impurities or spent reagent. The column usually comprises a separation medium such as, for example, an ion exchange medium, and the like. It is within the purview of the present invention to employ one or more purification systems depending on the nature and condition of the fluid reagent exiting the flow cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Fluid exiting the purification system may be directed to a holding element where an aliquot of the fluid is examined. The holding element may be any suitable receptacle. An appropriate sensor is employed to determine the condition of the fluid reagent. The fluid is examined by the sensor and, based on a determination of the condition of the liquid by the sensor, at least a portion or all of the liquid is directed to the inlet of the flow cell to be combined with fresh fluid reagent or is sent to waste. The sensor may be the same as or similar to a sensor mentioned above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The following discussion is by way of illustration and not limitation. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1 a</cross-reference> flow cell <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is depicted in which one step in the synthesis of an array of polynucleotides is carried out. As mentioned above, one such step involves the oxidation of a phosphite group to a phosphate group. In accordance with the present invention a dedicated flow cell is employed. A support on which the array is synthesized is placed in flow cell <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and a fluid oxidizer reagent F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is introduced into flow cell <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. After an appropriate incubation period, the fluid reagent is caused to exit flow cell <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> through an outlet and is directed to a dehydration column <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The dehydration column may be any suitable column known in the art for dehydration. A sample of the fluid oxidizer reagent in the dehydration column is directed to an anhydrous chamber <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, which is in fluid communication with dehydration column <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The fluid oxidizer reagent is allowed to equilibrate for a predetermined period of time, which is dependent of the nature of the fluid reagent and is usually determined empirically. A humidity sensor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> examines the equilibrated fluid oxidizer reagent. The humidity sensor may be any suitable sensor as known in the art. A predetermined threshold of oxidizer activity is set and the output from sensor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is compared to this threshold value. Depending on the determination by sensor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, the fluid oxidizer reagent is either sent to waste or recycled (designated R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) for combination with fresh oxidizer reagent F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and introduction into the flow cell. A suitable valve <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, such as, e.g., a three-way valve, is employed and is controlled by appropriate electronics to react to the input from the humidity sensor. As a result of the input from the sensor, valve <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> opens to waste or to the recycling line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Referring to again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> fluid wash reagent F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, namely, acetonitrile in this example, is introduced into flow cell <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> following the oxidization with the oxidizer reagent. After an appropriate incubation period, the fluid wash reagent is caused to exit the flow cell through an outlet and is directed through a sensor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> that determines the level of contamination of the fluid wash reagent. The nature of sensor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is dependent on the nature of the fluid wash reagent and on the nature of the contaminants that may be present in the fluid wash reagent. Contamination sensor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be, for example, an optical sensor, and the like. A predetermined threshold level of contamination is set above which the fluid wash reagent is sent to waste. Depending on the contamination sensor reading, the fluid wash reagent is sent to waste or to a dehydration column <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. An appropriate valve <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is employed that is actuated by the contamination sensor reading. A sample of the fluid wash reagent in dehydration column <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is directed to an anhydrous chamber <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, which is in fluid communication with dehydration column <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. The fluid wash reagent is allowed to equilibrate in anhydrous chamber <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> for a predetermined period of time, which is dependent of the nature of the fluid wash reagent. A humidity sensor <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> examines the equilibrated fluid wash reagent. A predetermined threshold of contamination is set and the output from sensor <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is compared to this threshold. Depending on the determination by sensor <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, the fluid wash reagent is either sent to waste or recycled (designated R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) to be combined with fresh wash reagent F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for introduction into the flow cell. A suitable valve <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, such as, e.g., a three-way valve, is employed and is controlled by appropriate electronics to react to the input from humidity sensor <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. As a result of the input from sensor <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, valve <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> opens to waste or to the recycling line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment of the above is depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. A flow cell <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is depicted in which another step in the synthesis of an array of polynucleotides is carried out. As mentioned above, one such step involves the removal of protecting groups or deblocking the reactive sites on the surface of the support. In accordance with the present invention a dedicated flow cell <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is employed for this synthetic step. A support on which the array is synthesized is placed in flow cell <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and a fluid deblocking reagent F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; such as, for example, dilute mineral acid, and the like is introduced into the flow cell. After an appropriate incubation period, the fluid deblocking reagent is caused to exit the flow cell through an outlet and is directed to an ion exchange column <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. The nature of ion exchange column <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> is dependent on the nature of the ionic contaminants, i.e., whether the contaminants are cationic or anionic, and so forth. Ionic contaminants such as trityl cation, and the like are removed from the fluid deblocking reagent in ion exchange column <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. The material in the ion exchange column will be suggested to those skilled in the art in view of the disclosure herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The extent of contaminant removal is determined by an appropriate contamination sensor <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> such as an optical sensor, and the like. A predetermined threshold level of contamination is set above which the fluid deblocking reagent is sent to waste. Depending on the reading by contamination sensor <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, the fluid deblocking reagent is sent to waste or to a dehydration column <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>. An appropriate valve <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> is employed that is actuated by the contamination sensor reading. A sample of the fluid deblocking reagent in dehydration column <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> is directed to an anhydrous chamber <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, which is in fluid communication with dehydration column <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>. The fluid deblocking reagent is allowed to equilibrate for a predetermined period of time, which is dependent of the nature of the fluid deblocking reagent. A humidity sensor <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> examines the equilibrated fluid deblocking reagent. A predetermined threshold of contamination is set and the output from sensor <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> is compared to this threshold value. Depending on the determination by the sensor, the fluid deblocking reagent is either sent to waste or recycled (designated R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) for combination with fresh deblocking reagent F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; and introduction into flow cell <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. A suitable valve <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>, such as, e.g., a three-way valve, is employed and is controlled by appropriate electronics to react to the input from humidity sensor <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>. As a result of the input from sensor <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>, valve <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> opens to waste or to the recycling line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Referring again to again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> fluid wash reagent F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime;, namely, acetonitrile, is introduced into flow cell <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> following the deblocking with the deblocking reagent. After an appropriate incubation period, the fluid deblocking reagent is caused to exit flow cell <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> through an outlet and is directed to an ion exchange column <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight>. The nature of ion exchange column <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> is dependent on the nature of the ionic contaminants as discussed above.

<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The extent of contaminant removal is determined by an appropriate contamination sensor <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> such as an optical sensor, and the like. A predetermined threshold level of contamination is set above which the fluid wash reagent is sent to waste. Depending on the reading from contamination sensor <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight>, the fluid wash reagent is sent to waste or to a dehydration column <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. An appropriate valve <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> is employed that is actuated by the reading from contamination sensor <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight>. A sample of the fluid wash reagent in dehydration column <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is directed to an anhydrous chamber <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>, which is in fluid communication with dehydration column <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. The fluid wash reagent is allowed to equilibrate for a predetermined period of time, which is dependent of the nature of the fluid wash reagent and the nature of any contaminants. A humidity sensor <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> examines the equilibrated fluid wash reagent. A predetermined threshold of contamination is set and the output from sensor <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> is compared to this threshold value.

<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment of the present invention is an apparatus for synthesizing an array of biopolymers on the surface of a support. The apparatus comprises a platform and a plurality of flow cells mounted on the platform.
