<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to Electronic Funds Transaction Point of Sale (EFTPOS) systems, and more particularly to processing payments for purchases through non-conventional terminals and communication devices. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Electronic Funds Transaction Point of Sale (EFTPOS) terminals and systems have operated for many years. Most current EFTPOS terminals function in the same manner in that account data are input to the terminal, usually via a magnetic stripe reading device. A display and keypad are usually integrated with the EFTPOS terminal. The consumer is prompted to enter a personal identification number (PIN) associated with a debit card before the account data are sent to a bank or financial institution for payment authorization. Once authorization is received the transaction continues until completion, for example, by receipt of article purchased and the sales receipt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> EFTPOS systems are highly secure systems that are designed to run a limited number of applications using a dial out modem. The modem is linked to servers that are controlled by financial institutions. Only authorized bank personnel are authorized to install or upgrade software applications residing in the EFTPOS terminals. PIN numbers are not stored in the terminals, and tampering with any EFTPOS terminal is automatically detected and payment transactions through the tampered line are immediately suspended. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> EFTPOS terminals are usually located adjacent the cash register in merchant locations for conveniently processing payments. Once the data are input to the terminal, the data are sent via a transaction-switching network to the host computer of the customer&apos;s bank to obtain bank authorization. The merchant&apos;s bank coordinates the settlement of funds from the customer&apos;s bank to the merchant&apos;s bank. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Consumers that shop frequently on-line or pay their bills on-line try to balance convenience with risk since these transactions have relatively poor security safeguards. Despite the efforts of on-line vendors to improve the security of purchase transactions, the fact that the transactions are being conducted over a public network, such as the Internet, makes it extremely difficult to prevent others from capturing sensitive information as it is being transmitted over the public network. EFTPOS systems, on the other hand, provide a high level of security in processing payments due to controlled communications lines and complex protocols required by financial institutions. However, these transactions are limited to authorization of payments and electronic funds transfers that are not conducted over the Internet or any other public network. Any attempts to make EFTPOS systems more flexible have been deterred due to the number of different protocols that exist (since each financial institution has its own protocol and guidelines) and the requirement of controlling communications to maintain high levels of security. Personal computers do offer the convenience of entering your credit card number for on-line purchases. However, payment security is compromised as a consequence of such convenience. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Further complicating efforts at improving payment processing security over unsecured communications networks is the advent of new marketing channels offering consumers more purchasing opportunities. For instance, products that are offered for sale via a mobile telephone or a PDA (personal digital assistant) require the consumer to call in to the vendor to effect payment. In another example, sales volume of selling products through cable TV shopping programs could be significantly increased if the payment processing for such purchases is streamlined from the current call-in system. Despite the opportunities that vendors have to access consumers in new ways, vendors and consumers must still transact payments through traditional POS terminals or by communicating credit card information through a traditional call-in system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A method and a system that address the aforementioned problems, as well as other related problems, are therefore desirable. </paragraph>
</section>

<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> While the invention is amenable to various modifications and alternative forms, specifics thereof have been shown by way of example in the drawings and will be described in detail. It should be understood, however, that the intention is not to limit the invention to the particular embodiments described. On the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. </paragraph>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Various embodiments of the present invention are described in connection with providing payment-processing services to merchants for facilitating payments made by customers not using traditional POS terminals. In addition, an enhanced payment processing system of the present invention will facilitate the addition of new data communications devices that communicate via distinct protocols and communication channels without the need to reconfigure the entire payment processing system. For purposes of this application, data processing systems (DPS) include, but are not necessarily limited to, personal computers, internet appliances, e-Service related entities and objects, servers and workstations. Data communication devices include, but are not necessarily limited to, PDAs, mobile and WAP-enabled telephones and two-way pagers. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the invention could be implemented in a variety of programming languages and hardware platforms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In an example embodiment, a payment server serves as the front end of an electronic funds transfer point of sale (EFTPOS) system to process payments received from secured and unsecured data communication devices. For instance, a merchant subscribing to payment services provided by a CSP (Commerce Service Provider) can now offer his customers the convenience of paying for purchases via a mobile telephone (or a set top box) with the security of a POS terminal. A payment server managed by the CSP processes payment requests received via various channels each with a distinct protocol. In one example, a payment request received at the payment server from a customer&apos;s set top box is in a protocol selected by the cable service provider and is processed by an adapter module configured specifically for the selected protocol. In another example, payment requests received from SSL/SET enabled data communications devices are processed by another adapter module configured specifically for SSL/SET-based requests. The payment requests include a merchant identification code, a set of customer financial account data (e.g., credit card) and the purchase amount. In a related embodiment, the payment requests include a date and time and a purchase code. The payment server receives the payment request at one of a number of adapter modules that are each configured to respond to each protocol of each communications channel. Each of the adapter modules includes a payment processing application that identifies a financial institution identification code associated with the merchant identification code. The adapter modules interface with a data processing system of the financial institution (or bank) consistent with a communications protocol associated with the identified financial institution. Once the payment request is routed to the appropriate bank, than the request is handled as a normal ACH (automatic clearinghouse) transaction, which includes transferring funds from the credit card issuer to the merchant&apos;s bank. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the figures, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates a payment request processing clearinghouse system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> that incorporates a payment server arrangement <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> in accordance with an example embodiment of the invention. In this example, system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a payment processing system <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> that is communicatively coupled to data processing systems of a financial clearinghouse network <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. In particular, system <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> includes payment server arrangement <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> that receives payment requests from a plurality of data communications <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> via various communications links <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> having respective communications protocols. Payment server arrangement <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of adapter modules <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, a merchant/bank identification code database <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and a communications interface <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. Each of the adapter modules includes a payment processing application configured to process payment requests received in a distinctive protocol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Payment server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> also includes a processor arrangement (not shown) that processes incoming signals as well as a memory arrangement (not shown) that stores the payment applications. Once the payment request is processed through the adapter modules the payment request is forwarded through interface <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> to banks <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. Banks <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> perform the traditional clearinghouse tasks through merchant bank DPS <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> and through customer bank DPS <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>. In related embodiment, a merchant transactions database <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> is configured to receive and store historical (processed) payment data for later use in demographic research. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In this example embodiment, POS adapter module <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of payment server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> includes a payment processing application <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>A that is configured to receive payment requests from customers at POS terminals <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> via communications link <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. POS terminals <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>C read a credit card (or a smart card or a chip card) tendered by the customer to effect a purchase payment and transmit a set of the customer-specific financial account data to adapter module <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, POS terminal <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>A is a thin client POS that does not include memory or a microprocessor. Terminal <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>A relays the payment request data immediately to adapter module <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> for processing the payment request. Adapter module <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> takes control of the interactions between terminal <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>A and server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> by sending commands to terminal <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>A to display data, to send data to a PIN PAD display (not shown), send data to a printer or send data to the chipcard. Data includes payment amount, retail location, merchant identification codes, personal identification numbers or other information that needs to be relayed to financial network <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. Adapter <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> communicates with terminal <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>A until the payment request is complete before forwarding the request to financial network <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> for processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In another example embodiment, terminal <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>B is a &ldquo;FAT&rdquo; client POS that includes processing and memory capabilities as well as an integrated modem and software. Terminal <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>B incorporates multiple applications and shares processing duties with server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Thus, the payment processing request is completed at terminal <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>B before the request is encrypted and forwarded to adapter module <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> for further processing. A communications link <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> between terminals <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> could be wireless (wireless WAN or cellular) or a standard communications network (e.g., modem to PSTN or LAN). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In this example embodiment, server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> also includes adapter module <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and an adapter module <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> that are configured to communicate with a set top box and SSL/SET-enabled communications devices, respectively. Adapter module <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> receives a payment request from a customer&apos;s set top box <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> via cable or satellite link <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. Payment processing application <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>A of adapter module <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> identifies the financial institution <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> associated with the merchant identification code using database <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. In this example, database <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> also includes a description of the communications protocol used by the financial institution for network communications. Application <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>A converts the payment request to an electronic format that is suitable for processing by the data processing system of the identified financial institution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Similar to adapter module <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, adapter module <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> receives a payment request from a customer&apos;s mobile telephone or PDA <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> (SSL/SET-enabled communications device) via a wireless communications link <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. In a related embodiment, adapter module <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> receives the payment request only after the customer enables a customer-controlled server (not shown) to send the customer financial account data. The customer-controlled server includes financial account data of the customer that is only made available to third parties upon the customer&apos;s request. Transactions processed through the customer-controlled financial server are configured to be more secure than sending the credit card information directly for payment processing. Merchants are encouraged to use more secure alternatives for receiving payments from customers by paying processing fees that are related to the level of security of the payment processing channel. The more secure the processing channel the lower the fee that the merchant is charged per transaction. In one example, the merchant is charged a 2% fee of the value of the customer purchase when the customer uses the POS terminal <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> versus 6% when the customer sends the credit card information over an unsecured data communications line. Since the customer-controlled financial server is considered highly secure, transactions processed therethrough will be at a lower cost to the merchant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> One of the advantages to server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is the ability to retrofit older EFTPOS systems with server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to automatically upgrade the entire payment processing system. Server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> provides older systems with the capability of processing payments from different sources without compromising security. New applications are easily added to server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> without having to make hardware adjustments/changes at any of the data communications devices <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Other data communications devices for effecting payments include vending machines or kiosks that are configurable to communicate as POS terminals or as SSL/SET-enabled devices. Once configured, the vending machine and the kiosk appear to server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> as remote data communications devices and the server processes the payment requests as usual. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In another example embodiment, another entry point (not shown) to payment server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> includes data communication devices used by small merchants that do not have a fixed POS terminal location but have their own authorization line with a financial institution. In this example, a small merchant or a taxi driver uses a thin POS device (e.g., mobile telephone) to enter the credit card number of the customer or passenger. In another example, the mobile telephone is WAP-enabled or utilizes the SMS (short message service) where he is operating in a GSM environment. The merchant then proceeds to send the financial account information along with his merchant identification code to server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> for payment processing as described in the other related embodiments above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In yet another example embodiment, another entry point (not shown) to payment server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> for the customer includes, but is not necessarily limited to, a personal communications device (e.g., PDA) and a smart card enabled mobile telephone. With these data communications devices, the customer sends the financial account data (e.g., credit card number) with the merchant identification to server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> for payment processing as described in connection with other related embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> flowchart <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> illustrates a computer-implemented method of processing payment requests from various secured and unsecured data communication devices in accordance with example embodiment of the invention. The payment requests include a merchant identification code and a set of customer financial data. In a related embodiment, time and date as well as a purchase code is included in the payment request. At step <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, the method includes providing a plurality of adapter modules <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> each of which is configured to interface with one or more of communications devices <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> via a selected communications channel (e.g., <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>). At step <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, adapter modules <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> receive payment requests from data communications devices <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> via the communications channels <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. At step <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, the financial institutions <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> associated with the merchant identification codes are identified, with each financial institution having an associated data processing system for processing payment requests. At step <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, the method also includes interfacing with the data processing systems of the financial institutions <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> consistent with payment protocols associated with the financial institutions. At step <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, payment processing occurs at the identified financial institution. At step <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, adapter module transmits a payment request status via the selected communications channel to one of the data communications devices <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Various embodiments of the invention are believed to be applicable to a variety of payment request processing systems. The present invention has been found to be particularly applicable and beneficial in scenarios involving payment processing requests using personal communications devices owned by the customer. Other aspects and embodiments of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from consideration of the specification and practice of the invention disclosed herein. It is intended that the specification and illustrated embodiments be considered as examples only, with a true scope and spirit of the invention being indicated by the following claims. </paragraph>
