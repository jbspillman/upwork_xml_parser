<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to the control of an internal combustion engine. More specifically, the present invention relates to calibrating target wheels for speed, timing, and position sensing systems used in internal combustion engines. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Presently, automotive companies manufacture data or target wheels for use with speed sensors to detect the speed, timing, and position of an engine crankshaft and/or a camshaft. As is known in the art of four-cycle internal combustion engines (ICEs), position and timing between a crankshaft and a camshaft is very important for the application and synchronization of spark and fuel, as the camshaft actuates the intake and exhaust valves of an ICE. A camshaft may be used in an overhead valve (OHV) configuration where the valves are actuated via pushrods, or in an overhead cam (OHC) configuration where the valves are acted on directly by the camshaft. The camshaft is driven by the crankshaft through a <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>:<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> reduction (i.e., two rotations of the crankshaft equal one rotation of the camshaft) and the camshaft speed is one-half that of the crankshaft. The crankshaft and camshaft position, for engine control purposes, are measured at a small number of fixed points, and the number of such measurements may be determined by the number of cylinders in the ICE. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> As previously described, engine control systems use the timing and position information supplied by a crankshaft and camshaft sensor for controlling the application of spark and fuel to the cylinders of an ICE. The position and timing (phase) of a first camshaft controlling exhaust valves for a cylinder and/or a second camshaft controlling intake valves for a cylinder in an overhead cam engine may be controlled relative to the crankshaft (piston position) to reduce emissions and improve fuel economy. Several cam-phasing devices (cam phasers) exist in today&apos;s automotive market that require accurate position and timing information provided by the camshaft position sensor. The crankshaft and/or camshaft position sensor typically include a variable reluctance or Hall effect sensor positioned to sense the passage of a tooth, tab and/or slot on a target or data wheel coupled to the camshaft. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The target or data wheel used with present camshaft position sensors have a distribution of teeth, tabs and/or slots. The camshaft position sensor typically comprises a variable reluctance or Hall effect sensor positioned to sense the teeth on a target or data wheel coupled to the camshaft. The magnetic properties and material composition of the target wheel will vary where and when the sensor senses the teeth on a moving target wheel. This variation may cause problems in the feedback provided by the sensor. For example, two target wheels with identical footprints but made of different materials will have different magnetic and switching characteristics. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> sensor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is positioned to sense the teeth <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of target wheel <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. For a first material, the sensor may switch at point A and for a second material the sensor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may switch at point B. The varying material compositions that happen during manufacturing processes even within the same &ldquo;batch&rdquo; of target wheels produced in the same factory may lead to an inconsistency in sensing or switching. This difference in switching between point A and point B will adversely affect the ability to predict the switching position of the sensor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and program or calibrate the control of an ICE. Thus, there is a need to better determine the magnetic and switching characteristics for a target wheel to more accurately control an ICE. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The present invention comprises a target wheel calibration method and apparatus used to detect camshaft and crankshaft timing, position and speed for a four-cycle internal combustion engine (&ldquo;ICE&apos;&rdquo;). The present invention utilizes a method of detecting the position of a target wheel tooth (or teeth) at a known position relative to the crankshaft and camshaft. The method comprises zeroing/homing a cam phaser coupled to the target wheel and camshaft and then rotating the crankshaft through two revolutions (thereby rotating the camshaft one revolution) to determine where the teeth of the target wheel switch the sensor. The switching time and position of the teeth of the target wheel on the camshaft are referenced to the target wheel pulse train of the crankshaft. The switching position of the target wheel on the camshaft is thus &ldquo;known&rdquo; with respect to the position of the crankshaft and corresponding cylinder events. This position and timing information is stored and referenced by a controller to control the functions of the ICE.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, an internal combustion engine (ICE) <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having a crankshaft <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> generates a pulse train via the rotation of a target wheel <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> on the crankshaft <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> sensed by a conventional wheel speed sensor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The wheel speed sensor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may comprise any known wheel speed-sensing device including, but not limited to, variable reluctance sensors, Hall effect sensors, optical switches, and proximity switches. The purpose of the wheel speed sensor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is to detect the teeth on the target wheel <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and provide the pulse train to an electronic controller <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The electronic controller <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, in conjunction with other sensors, will determine the speed and position of the crankshaft <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> using the pulse train generated by the speed sensor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The vehicle controller <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be any known microprocessor or controller used in the art of engine control. In the preferred embodiment, the controller <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is a microprocessor, having nonvolatile memory NVM <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> such as ROM, EEPROM, or flash memory, random access memory RAM <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, and a central processing unit (CPU) <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The CPU <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> executes a series of programs to read, condition, and store inputs from vehicle sensors. The controller <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> uses various sensor inputs to control the application of fuel and spark to each cylinder through conventional spark and fuel injector signals <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The controller <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> further includes calibration constants and software stored in NVM <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> that may be applied to control numerous engine types. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the ICE is equipped with an exhaust camshaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and intake camshaft <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The exhaust camshaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and intake camshaft <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> are coupled to the crankshaft <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> via a timing belt or chain <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and sprockets coupled to the camshafts <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The exhaust camshaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> actuates exhaust valves for the cylinders, and the intake camshaft <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> actuates intake valves for the cylinders, as is commonly known in the art. A target wheel <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> coupled to the exhaust camshaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> generates periodic signals using wheel speed sensor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to provide speed and position information for the exhaust camshaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The wheel speed sensor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be similar in functionality to wheel speed sensor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The present invention may further be equipped with a continuously variable cam phaser <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, as is known in the art. The cam phaser <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in the preferred embodiment is coupled to the exhaust camshaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. In alternate embodiments of the present invention, a cam phaser may be coupled to the intake camshaft <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> or to both the exhaust and intake camshafts <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, or a common intake/exhaust cam depending on the desired performance and emission requirements of the ICE <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The cam phaser <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is preferably hydraulically modulated to create a variable rotational offset between the exhaust camshaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the intake camshaft <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and/or the crankshaft <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The degree of rotational offset generated by the cam phaser <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> enables the ICE <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to be tuned for specific performance requirements by varying valve overlap, i.e., overlap between the exhaust and intake valves of the ICE <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In applications where it is required that NOx components are reduced, the cam phaser <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can provide charge dilution in the form of recirculated exhaust gases. Charge dilution is a method of adding an inert substance to the air/fuel mixture in a cylinder of the ICE <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The inert substance will increase the heat capacity of the air/fuel mixture and reduce the amount of NOx components created during combustion. Accordingly, by regulating the valve overlap area, NOx components may also be regulated. Furthermore, engine performance characteristics such as horsepower and fuel economy may also be modified using the cam phaser. For an ICE equipped with camshafts that operate both intake and exhaust valves, valve timing relative to the combustion cycle may be adjusted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a diagram of the target wheel <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of the preferred embodiment of the present invention that will be described in conjunction with a timing diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The target wheel <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> includes an irregular surface having teeth, slots, or tabs <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. The teeth <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are smaller in length than the teeth <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> to differentiate the intake and exhaust phases of the ICE <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The teeth <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are fifteen degrees wide and are spaced forty-five degrees apart. The teeth <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> are forty-five degrees wide and are spaced fifteen degrees apart. The inner diameter of the teeth <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is preferably 72 mm and the outer diameter is preferably 75 mm, generating a 3 mm tooth height for teeth <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. The teeth <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> further include clearly defined edges for generating a pulse train for wheel position sensor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the target wheel <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and sensor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are shown. The target wheel <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> preferably has a diameter of 171.89 mm (approximately 4.0 mm wide) and includes fifty-eight teeth <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The teeth <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are preferably three degrees apart and three degrees wide and are chamfered on the corners. The height of the teeth <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is preferably 4.0 mm. The target wheel <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> further includes a fifteen degree-wide void <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to provide a marker pulse for a complete revolution of the target wheel <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> timing diagram is shown with a pulse train <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> generated by the target wheel <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and target wheel sensor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, a pulse train <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> generated by the target wheel <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and target wheel position sensor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, an engine cycle reference <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, and an engine position reference <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. The pulse trains <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> include events that correspond to the physical layout of the teeth <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of target wheel <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the teeth <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of target wheel <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The pulse trains <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> signal the controller <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> the state of the exhaust camshaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the state of the crankshaft <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (i.e., is it in the compression or exhaust phase) and corresponding cylinder events to allow the application of spark and fuel by the controller <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the pulse train <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> has been processed to provide a specific cylinder event for each specific pulse. For example, a six pulse period for pulse train <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> will correspond to a six cylinder engine, each pulse indicating the top dead center (TDC) or bottom dead center (BDC) position for the six cylinders. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the crankshaft <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to camshaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> angle is determined from the following ratios: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>C/D&equals;E/F </italic></highlight></in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Where C&equals;the crankshaft-to-camshaft exhaust camshaft angle </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> D&equals;the crankshaft period in degrees </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> E&equals;the period between cylinder and cam events </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> F&equals;the period between cylinder events </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Where D&equals;(720 degrees)/(the number of cylinders in the engine) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The method of the present invention can be described as first zeroing or homing the cam phaser <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> coupled to the target wheel <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and then rotating the target wheel <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> one revolution such that teeth <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> generate the pulse train <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The individual pulses generated by the teeth <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> are referenced to pulses/cylinder events generated by the crankshaft <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the pulse train <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and stored in the controller <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. All camshaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> phase positions are thus referenced individually relative to the home position and cylinder events in the pulse train <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The position of the crankshaft <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is known to be a certain number of counts from the void <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, by zeroing the cam phaser <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and learning the individual positions of the teeth <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> on startup, the sensor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> (and sensor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>) will be able to reproduce a consistent signal from teeth <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of target wheel <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Thus, the physical cam position relative to crank or cam phase may be determined while simultaneously negating effects of tooth to tooth variation on the calculation of the cam phase angle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The preferred method of the present invention can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> as a flowchart. Starting at block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the cam phaser <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is zeroed or homed to a known position relative to the crankshaft <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The crankshaft <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is then rotated at least two revolutions at block <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The sensor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> will generate pulses from the target wheel <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> coupled to the crankshaft <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The routine at block <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> will then register the timing and position of the pulses generated by the sensor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and target wheel <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> relative to the pulses generated by sensor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The pulse trains <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are thus referenced against each other. At block <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, these timing and position values will be stored in the NVM <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the controller <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to be used in the control of the ICE <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the method will be executed whenever the cam phaser <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is in the home position and new position values for a tooth will be filtered into the result of the detection of the tooth. This allows compensating for any variations that may be caused by temperature or other environmental conditions. In alternate embodiments of the present invention, the method can be executed at the initial startup of the ICE <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, or the method may be executed when engine timing problems have been detected. </paragraph>
