<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates generally to reliability testing, and more specifically, to a system and method for a device reliability and test circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Semiconductor devices exhibit high reliability since the electronic functions thereof are primarily performed within a solid, and this solid can be expected to retain its initial properties indefinitely, if it is not subjected to conditions beyond its limits. Semiconductor devices are being required to meet reliability levels far in excess of older types of electronic devices. Failure in semiconductor devices, such as field effect transistors, that are observed over a period of time, are principally caused by the sensitivity of these devices to slight imperfections or variations in the manufacturing processes in which submicroscopic effects play so vital a role. These imperfections are so slight that they cannot be detected by the most precise production inspection and show up only as changes in the characteristics of the device over an extended period of time. Therefore it is desirable, and in some instances, necessary, not only to test semiconductor devices for initial satisfactory operating characteristics, but to test them to determine or predict the span of the reliable operating life. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> To improve the reliability of semiconductor devices, it is necessary to be able to measure reliability itself with reasonable accuracy. In many past applications, the failure rates of semiconductor devices were so low that it was impossible to measure actual failure rates under normal operating conditions. The semiconductor industry has often turned to stress acceleration testing in order to shorten the time to failure, hopefully, without introducing new failure mechanisms. Most stress, or accelerated, testing techniques known in the art rely on increases in operating temperature/voltage/current to produce failures at an earlier point in time because it is believed that increases in temperature normally will not introduce any failure mechanisms which would not be present under normal operating conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Unfortunately, in the manufacture of semiconductor devices, particularly field effect transistors, not only are many failure modes present, but insufficient data exists to determine the form taken by the failure acceleration curve. Further, attempts to determine reliability of semiconductor devices are typically concerned with determining failure modes early in a failure period. Regrettably, the results of such attempts may be inconclusive for time dependent failure mechanisms. Thus, time dependent failures may be an unexpected source of costly problems. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The system and method described herein may be used to aid in the proper selection of a device for a certain application and/or aid in determining the reliability of the device for the application. As is well known, electrical and electronic devices have recommended operating parameters. For example, for devices such as semiconductors, capacitors and insulators, an operating parameter such as a rated voltage is specified. A device may be selected for a particular application based on a factor such as its rated voltage. However, in applications applying a DC voltage less than the rated voltage, failures may occur as the applied voltage approaches the rated voltage. Note that the root cause(s) of such failures are not currently known. However, a possibility may be that of a single even burnout (SEB) type of event in which radiation generates electron-hole pair generation in the depletion region of the reversed bias junction, which triggers an avalanche phenomenon akin to secondary breakdown of the parsitic npn inhernet in every power MOSFET. Therefore, the rated voltage of a device may not be determinative of the device&apos;s use and/or reliability in certain applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> system for a device reliability and test circuit in one embodiment will now be discussed. In general, in the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> DC voltage below the device&apos;s rated voltage is applied for a period of time. As is well known, when a semiconductor device, such as a FET, begins to fail, it will begin to conduct a current (leakage current) between its source and drain terminals. Note that the system and method described herein may also be used for devices other than power MOSFETs. For example, capacitors, diodes, and bipolar transistors may be tested using the system and method. Also, note that the time period of the test may be open ended. For example, the test time period for a power MOSFET may range from about one day to about three weeks. However, in some cases, the testing may even be completed within hours. Basically, the time period is the amount of time for a particular device to fail at a DC voltage below the device&apos;s rated voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> DC voltage source <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, such as a battery, power supply or the like is shown operatively connected to a device under test (DUT) <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. As previously mentioned, the DUT <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be any device where the leakage characteristics are desired to be determined at a voltage below the rated voltage. A measurement device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, such as a current meter, voltage meter or the like is shown operatively connected to the DUT <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for detecting a leakage current by measuring the current through the DUT <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A recorder <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, that may include a printer and/or monitor or the like is shown operatively connected to the measurement device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for recording measured data. A database <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be included for storing the measured data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> means for protecting the test equipment (e.g., by limiting the current) may be included, hereafter referred to as equipment protection device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. For example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a schematic of an exemplary configuration for protecting the DC voltage source, while maintaining a constant voltage across the DUT <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. As previously discussed, the embodiments described herein are not limited to a MOSFET device. The voltage is applied to the source and drain of the DUT <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> such that the onset of any leakage current does not result in a diminution of the applied voltage. This allows the voltage across the DUT <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to remain constant even as the DUT <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> begins to fail. The equipment protection device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> includes a current limiting resistor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> operatively connected in series with the DUT <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Basically, the current limiting resistor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is selected to ensure that the test equipment and/or DUT <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is not damaged. Note that the current capability of the power supply used in the test setup determines what value the limiting resistor should be. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> If used alone, the current limiting resistor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> would act to modulate a failure (e.g., leakage current) by transferring voltage from the DUT <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the current limiting resistor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> as the DUT <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> began to fail. The voltage across the DUT <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> would decrease as the leakage current increased, thereby slowing down and eventually halting the failure (e.g., stabilizing the leakage current). For example, a shorting of the DUT <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> would begin the process of transferring voltage from the DUT <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the limiting resistor. This transfer of voltage to the resistor would effectively decrease the energy dissipated within the DUT <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. If the transfer of voltage happened quickly enough, the shorting event might not be catastrophic to the DUT <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. It is the combination of a short in the DUT <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, plus a sustained voltage that causes failure of the DUT <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Therefore, a capacitor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may be operatively connected in parallel with the current limiting resistor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to obviate the effect of the current limiting resistor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The capacitor is intended to &ldquo;slow down&rdquo; the rate of voltage transfer from the failing DUT <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the limiting resistor. Therefore, the capacitor may be relatively large (e.g., for a power MOSFET under test, the capacitor may be greater than about 2.5 &mgr;f). As a voltage is applied to the circuit, initially, all the applied voltage is across the DUT <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, but when the DUT <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> begins to fail (e.g., when the leakage current begins to increase), the capacitor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> acts as a short and the applied voltage across the DUT <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is kept constant (even as the leakage current increases). Note that other embodiments may include any circuit configuration that protects the equipment while maintaining a constant voltage across the DUT <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment for protecting the test equipment is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. A circuit breaker <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is operatively connected in series with the DUT <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The circuit breaker <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is selected to trip at a specified current rating. For example, an ultra fast circuit breaker may be used to quickly (e.g., within about 5 &mgr;s) &ldquo;clamp&rdquo; a current spike to a value effectively near zero such that the peak value of the spike is prevented from exceeding a maximum value. The circuit breaker will then turn off within a certain time after the clamping action. It is the &lt;5 us clamping action which is the essential element of an ultra fast circuit breaker. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been described with reference to exemplary embodiments, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes may be made and equivalents may be substituted for elements thereof without departing from the scope of the invention. In addition, many modifications may be made to adapt a particular situation or material to the teachings of the invention without departing from the essential scope thereof. Therefore, it is intended that the invention not be limited to the particular embodiments disclosed for carrying out this invention, but that the invention will include o all embodiments falling within the scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
