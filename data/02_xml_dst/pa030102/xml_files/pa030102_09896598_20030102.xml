<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to a ground surface treatment apparatus, more particularly to a ground surface treatment apparatus adapted for receipt on a ground ripping tool of a self propelled vehicle such as a road grader or the like. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Numerous soil preparations and ground surface treatments are commonly required during a variety of earth moving operations, such as shoulder maintenance, construction site preparation, paving operations, utility installation, and landscaping, to name but a few. Almost always, the ground surface is modified, as by cutting, filling, scraping, ripping, etc., with quite a variety of machines and or implements available to perform the desired task. Inevitably, the re-contoured or modified ground surface requires some type of surface treatment, such as leveling, debris removal, compacting, etc., whether as a preliminary step in a multi-step ground surface finishing process (e.g., laying a road way), or as an end in itself (i.e., a finished condition). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Unlike the traditional farm tractor which may be equipped or outfitted with what seems to be an infinite number of attachments for completing whatever task a farmer may encounter, individual specialized pieces of equipment and dedicated skilled operators for each are necessary for the highly variable and many tasks encountered during earth moving operations. This greatly reduces the ability to &ldquo;multi-task,&rdquo; at least in comparison to the tractor in an agricultural setting, thereby contributing significantly to overall project costs. Although there exists no known single machine capable of accomplishing the many required soil preparations and/or ground surface treatments, a great deal of combined functionality is known for, and available in, commercially available earth moving machines such as crawlers (i.e., a track propelled vehicle), excavators, motor graders, and wheeled tractors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> By way of illustration, broom attachments are known for motor graders (U.S. Pat. No. 4,643,261), as are ripping tools for both crawlers (U.S. Pat. No. 4,252,376) and motor graders (U.S. Pat. No. 5,795,096), and rollers for dump trucks (U.S. Pat. No. 4,193,710), crawlers (U.S. Pat. No. 4,878,544), and motor graders (U.S. Pat. No. 3,993,413), to name but a few. Furthermore, an equal number of hook-ups or linkages are known, and likely available, to secure individual implements, such as blades, scarifiers, rippers, loaders, or power booms, to their carrying vehicles, whether they be those previously noted, or otherwise, with particular emphasis on the efficiency of the mounting/removal procedures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Although advances have been made so as to reduce the number of machines and/or operators on a job site, heretofore know machines are required to be selectively equipped with one of the many known implements, as by switching out one implement for another, which remains a time and labor intensive operation, typically requiring that such implements be transported to and from the job site, almost always by a vehicle separate from the carrying vehicle. Furthermore, a great many of the implements are unnecessarily cumbersome, having especially large and/or heavy frames for supporting the ground engaging tool either directly or indirectly, as is best exemplified in the case of road packers wherein spaced apart rows of pneumatic tires are supported by more than a single axle. Thus, there remains a need to efficiently offer a variety of ground surface treatments using a single machine, while minimizing the heretofore known burdens associated therewith. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A ground surface treatment apparatus including a frame adapted to be operatively received by a ground ripping attachment of a self propelled vehicle, and a ground engaging implement carried by the frame for treating the ground surface is provided. The apparatus further includes a resiliently responsive linkage interposed between a portion of the frame and a portion of the ground ripping attachment such that the frame is resiliently responsive to ground ripping tool manipulations and ground surface contours. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Referring generally to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, there is shown the ground surface treatment apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the subject invention operatively integrated with a ground ripping tool <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which itself is shown operatively joined to a self propelled vehicle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, for example, the motor grader as illustrated. The ground surface treatment apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> generally comprises a frame <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> adapted to be operatively received by the ground ripping attachment <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the self propelled vehicle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and a ground engaging implement <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> (e.g., a roller or rollers, compactor, etc.) carried by the frame <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for treating the ground surface. A resiliently responsive linkage assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is interposed between a portion of the frame <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and a portion of the ground ripping attachment <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> such that the frame <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is resiliently responsive to ground ripping tool manipulations, and ground surface contours. The resiliently responsive linkage assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> generally includes a bladder anchor structure <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, a bracket <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and a resilient bladder <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> which joins the free ends of the anchor structure <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the bracket <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> as will later be detailed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> With further reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the frame <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the ground surface treatment apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> generally includes a main beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> (i.e., structural member) which joins a pair of opposing arms <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. An axle <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, which is preferably but not necessarily adapted to carry a plurality of ground engaging rollers, as will subsequently be described, is operatively supported between the opposing arms <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the frame <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, more particularly, the opposing arms <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, along with an intermediate or center bracket <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, cooperatively engage an axle shaft <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> via axle mounting bearings <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> With particular reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 7</cross-reference>, a plurality of spaced apart apertured tabs <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (i.e., fastening structures) extend forward (i.e., in a direction away from the axle <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>) from the main beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. A first or outermost pair of apertured tabs <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are positioned (i.e., carried) at the opposing ends <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> of the main beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, more particularly the end surfaces thereof, with each of the opposing arms <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> shown attached thereto (i.e., bolted, see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> A second or intermediate pair of apertured tabs <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are positioned near the opposing ends <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> of the main beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> so as to be adjacent to the first pair of apertured tabs <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The first <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and second <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>pairs of apertured tabs supportingly receive a ripper shank or tooth <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> therebetween, the ripper shank <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> being adapted to receive a pivot pin or the like <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> for securing it to the frame <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the ground surface treatment apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, thereby defining a pivot interface <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> (i.e., a pivot frame linkage) for the ground surface treatment apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> relative to the ripping tool <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. By this association, the frame <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is fully integrated with the ripping tool <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> so as to be &ldquo;piggybacked&rdquo; thereon, with great efficiencies thereby accruing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A third or innermost pair of apertured tabs <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are positioned on the main structural member <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the frame <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to supportingly receive the arms <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of the bracket <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the linkage assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, and as will later be discussed with respect to the resiliently responsive linkage <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the bracket <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is joined to the frame <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> so as to be pivotable, a variable angle &thgr; being defined thereby. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> With particular reference now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>, the axle <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> generally traverses the opposing arms <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the frame <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, being operatively supported upon the arms <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the center bracket <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The axle <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, which comprises a shaft <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and mounting bearings <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, in turn operatively supports a plurality of spaced apart ground engaging rollers <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, more particularly, pneumatic tires. While the preferred ground engaging implement <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> comprises a plurality of spaced apart discrete rollers <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> on a single axle <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, it should be understood that numerous arrangements of, or configurations for, discrete rollers for treating a ground surface or the like are possible, being well within the skill of artisans in the subject area. So too are other axially supported rolling surface treatment implements contemplated, as for instance drum rollers, lobed wheels, rowed rollers, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The discrete rollers <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> generally comprise a rim <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and a tire <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> carried thereon, with rim size and tire style (e.g., pneumatic/solid, size/tread configuration, etc.) being a matter of sought after apparatus performance. The rollers <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are axially aligned in a spaced apart condition upon the axle shaft <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> by means of spacer hubs <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. Two spacer hub configurations are generally shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, in addition to the axle end bearing <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and frame arm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The doubly flanged spacer hub <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the foreground of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is adapted to carry two rollers (i.e., rims), whereas the centrally flanged spacer hub <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>there behind is capable of carrying a single roller. The general arrangement of the spacer hubs <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> on the axle shaft <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, namely an alternating arrangement of two, one, two for each half of the axle is shown (i.e., the single rim carrying hub <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is interposed between two of the double rim carrying hubs <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, which are in turn interposed between intermediate and end axle bearings <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>). This arrangement for the rollers upon the axle shaft, and more generally the axle assembly construction and interface with the frame, provides for expeditious assembly and disassembly, making repairs and or maintenance less burdensome and cumbersome than heretofore know assemblies, and further contributes to the versatility of the apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Referring now generally to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3, 4</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the resiliently responsive linkage assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is shown operatively engaged with a portion of the ripping tool <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, and disengaged therefrom in FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The resiliently responsive linkage assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> generally includes the bladder anchor structure <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the bracket <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and the resilient bladder <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> which joins the free or &ldquo;closed&rdquo; ends of the anchor structure <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the bracket <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The linkage assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> permits the efficient application of down pressure from the ripping tool <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the ground engaging rollers <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, via the apparatus frame <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, by providing a responsive, fluid interface between the pressure source and ground treatment implement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> As is best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, both the bladder anchor structure <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the bracket <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the resiliently responsive linkage assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> each have one end attached to the main beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the frame <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The bladder anchor structure <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is preferably joined to the main beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> so as to extend therefrom, more particularly, opposing arms <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> extend from the main beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and are joined together at their free ends to form a free or closed end for the bladder anchor structure. The bracket <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is similarly configured, having opposing arms <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> joined at their free ends to form a free or closed bracket end, however, the opposing arms <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are not directly and rigidly joined to the main beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the frame <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, instead being pivotably attached to the inner most apertured tabs <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>extending forward from the main beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 7</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Both the anchor structure <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the bracket <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> have their closed ends adapted to securingly receive ends of the resilient bladder <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> such that the frame <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is responsive to ripping tool manipulations and ground surface conditions, the frame <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> being buffered by the bladder or bladders <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Preferably, two bladders are interposed between the closed ends of the anchor structure <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the bracket <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, although the number of, or configuration for, the bladders <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is not limiting. Mounting hardware is used to indirectly secure the bladder in place, for instance, a plate <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and accompanying fasteners <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> &ldquo;anchor&rdquo; one end of the bladder <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to the bladder anchor structure <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, whereas the opposing bladder surface is indirectly attached to the bracket <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> via a bladder engaging element <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> (i.e., a displacer). It should be understood that the nature of the interface described for the opposing bladder ends may be reversed, and that other known fastening arrangements, mechanical or otherwise, are likewise contemplated, without departing from the scope of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the resiliently responsive linkage assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is operatively joined or anchored to the ripping tool <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by a bar <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> which guides the translation of the closed ends of the anchor structure <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the bracket <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, whether it be in a relative sense, as when the anchor structure <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> pivots in response to bladder expansion/contraction, or in a collective sense, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>, when the resiliently responsive linkage assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is disengaged from the ripping tool <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, when attached to a portion of the ripping tool <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the bar <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> positions the bracket <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for substantial abutting engagement therewith (FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in contrast to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>) so as to resist expansion of the bladders <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and thereby impart or transfer a downward force to the frame <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the apparatus, vis-a-vis the other components of the resiliently responsive linkage <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Both the anchor structure <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the bracket <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are equipped at their closed ends with loops or brackets <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, within which the bar <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is received. The bar <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is capable of reversible attachment to a portion of the ripping tool <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> which has been adapted to receive same. Although a conventional interface or connection between the bar <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and the ripping tool <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is contemplated, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 9</cross-reference>, other know means are equally suitable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The free end of the bar <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is adapted so as to receive one or more variably positionable limiters <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> (i.e., travel stops), such as a bolt or the like. Such adaptation prevents the dissociation of the anchor structure <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the bracket <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> from the operative connection (see e.g., FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>). Furthermore, a response limiter <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> (e.g., a chain, cable, etc.) tethers the anchor structure <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to the bracket <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and thereby limits translation of the anchor structure <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and frame <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> thereby, relative to the bracket <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (i.e., it prevents the bladders <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> from over-extending). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> While a preferred embodiment of the present invention has been described, it should be understood that various changes, adaptations and modifications may be made therein without departing from the spirit of the invention. Changes may be made in details, particularly in matters of shape, size, material, and arrangement of parts without exceeding the scope of the invention. Accordingly, the scope of the invention is as defined in the language of the appended claims. </paragraph>
