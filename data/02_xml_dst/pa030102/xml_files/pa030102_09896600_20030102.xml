<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A method and apparatus of call forwarding is presented whereby a wireless phone and one or more landline phones are equipped and programmed to perform call forwarding activation and de-activation automatically, without user intervention, based on geographic proximity relationships between the phones. When the wireless phone is not in near-proximity to any of the landline phones, calls to the landline phones are forwarded to the wireless phone. When the wireless phone comes in near-proximity to one of the landline phones, all calls to the wireless phone&mdash;including calls forwarded from other phones&mdash;are forwarded to the nearby landline phone. When the wireless phone subsequently leaves the nearby landline phone, all calls are sent to the wireless phone again. Advantageously, this arrangement overcomes numerous problems associated with manual activation and de-activation of call forwarding. In addition, the arrangement is entirely handset-based and requires no changes to network infrastructure, software, or established call forwarding procedures. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to the forwarding of calls within a telecommunications system, and specifically to the automatic forwarding of calls from one or more phones to another phone, based on the geographic proximity between the phones. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> It is common for wireless phone users such as cellular phone subscribers to carry their wireless phones at home, in the office, and at other places where landline phones are available for use. At such locations, it is to the advantage of the user to have wireless calls forwarded to a nearby landline phone, since landline service is typically less expensive. For example, when a cellular subscriber with call forwarding service arrives at the office, he/she would benefit by manually activating call forwarding so that calls intended for the wireless phone are automatically forwarded to the office phone. The activation process typically involves the user dialing a phone number and/or a feature code to activate call forwarding. Also, the user must typically enter a phone number to which calls are to be transferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A number of problems arise with the manual activation of call forwarding. To start, the user must remember the activation phone number and/or the feature code. In addition, manual activation takes time and is cumbersome&mdash;typically, the user must dial the activation phone number and/or feature code, wait for a system response, and then enter the forwarding number. Another problem is that the user must remember to activate the service. If the user is preoccupied or distracted, he/she may very well forget to activate call forwarding, resulting in receiving a call at a wireless phone that would have been more economical to take at a landline phone. Yet another problem that would typically occur in situations similar to the example stated above, is that the user must remember to de-activate call forwarding on the cellular phone when leaving the proximity of the office phone, to run an errand for example. If the user forgets to de-activate, he/she could miss important calls to the cellular phone. And even if the user does remember to de-activate call forwarding on the cellular phone, the user is faced with the problematic temptation to activate call forwarding on the office phone so that calls intended for the office phone are forwarded to the wireless phone. That manual activation is subject to its own set of problems analogous to those already stated. In short, it is easy to forget or forego the manual activation and de-activation of call forwarding on one phone, and it would be an outright annoyance to have to activate and de-activate call forwarding on multiple phones every time you go to the copy machine, run down the hall to pick up a report, or take some other short excursion away from your office. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Therefore, a need exists for a method and apparatus that allows for the forwarding of calls between wireless and landline phones automatically, without user interaction. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The present invention enables the automatic forwarding of calls between wireless and landline phones, based on the geographic proximity relationship between the phones. An exemplary embodiment of the present invention works as follows. Wireless phones and landline phones that provide automatic call forwarding are each equipped with a low-range radio transceiver, in addition to their traditional hardware and software components. Control programs operating within the wireless phones and the landline phones are further modified so that the phones attempt to establish communications with each other via the low-range radio transceivers. Call forwarding activation sequences are automatically performed by the wireless and landline phones, based on the ability or inability to establish communications between similarly enabled devices via the low-range radio transceivers. The user can also, upon entry of a code into one of the wireless phones or the landline phones, temporarily suspend automatic call forwarding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The present invention therefore provides the ability for users to have call forwarding activated automatically based the proximity of the involved phones without having to remember to activate or de-activate call forwarding. In addition, users do not have to remember activation phone numbers or feature codes. These need to be programmed only once by the manufacturer or by the user, at set-up time. Further, the present invention allows users the ability to temporarily suspend automatic call forwarding. Another significant advantage of the present invention is that no network hardware, software, or feature protocol changes are required to implement this invention. Sensing the need to forward calls and performing the procedures to forward calls are carried out entirely within the involved phones.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention can be better understood with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> depicts a communication system in accordance with the present invention. Phone <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is a landline phone comprising traditional landline hardware/software components <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, processor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, low-range transceiver <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, and antenna <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The user of phone <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can use traditional landline components <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which includes a keypad and optional display, not shown, to place and receive calls to and from telephone network <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and to manually activate and de-activate call forwarding by calling service provider equipment <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and using established procedures. Telephone network <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can be the Public Switched Telephone Network or some other public or private network. Service provider equipment <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> includes a switch and possibly other equipment, not shown, necessary to facilitate call forwarding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Processor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in phone <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> runs a program to facilitate Automatic Call Forwarding (ACF) in accordance with the present invention. Although illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> as a separate component, processor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can in fact be a processor included in traditional components <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Processor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> passes messages to low-range transceiver <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> for transmission. For example, a &ldquo;beacon message&rdquo; can be transmitted to notify other phones in nearby proximity that phone <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is equipped to provide automatic call forwarding. Other messages can be used to pass information to nearby phones that are similarly capable, as discussed later. Transceiver <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> also receives beacon messages and other messages from nearby, similarly capable phones and passes them to processor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for processing. Transceiver <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> transmits and receives signals through antenna <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, low-range transceivers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> utilize Bluetooth technology. Bluetooth is a wireless personal area network (PAN) technology from the Bluetooth Special Interest Group. Bluetooth is an open standard for short-range transmission of digital voice and data between mobile devices, such as laptops, PDAs, and phones, and desktop devices. Bluetooth supports point-to-point and multipoint applications. Bluetooth provides up to 720 Kbps data transfer within a range of 10 meters and up to 100 meters with a power boost. Bluetooth uses omnidirectional radio waves that can transmit through walls and other non-metal barriers. Bluetooth transmits in the unlicensed 2.4 GHz band and uses a frequency hopping spread spectrum technique that changes its signal 1600 times per second. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Phone <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is a landline phone, similar to phone <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, with components analogous to those of Phone <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Wireless phone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> comprises traditional wireless hardware/software components <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, processor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, low-range transceiver <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, and antenna <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. Wireless phone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be a cellular phone or some other wireless device. The user of phone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can use traditional wireless components <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, which includes a keypad and optional display, not shown, to place and receive calls to and from wireless network <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and to manually activate and de-activate call forwarding through wireless service provider equipment <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, using established procedures. Wireless network <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> can be a cellular network or some other public or private wireless network. Wireless service provider equipment <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> includes a radio base station, a switch, and possibly other equipment, not shown, needed to facilitate call forwarding. Processor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> runs a program to facilitate Automatic Call Forwarding (ACF) in accordance with the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Although illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> as a separate component, processor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can in fact be a processor included in traditional wireless components <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Low-range transceiver <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is used to communicate with low-range transceiver <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of phone <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and with low-range transceiver <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of phone <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, sending and receiving beacon messages and other messages that come from and go to processor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Transceiver <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> transmits and receives signals through antenna <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> which may be duplexed to operate with transceiver <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and with the traditional wireless components <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, or antenna <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> may be a separate antenna dedicated to low-range transceiver <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> When phones <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are first installed, they need to be programmed with call forwarding details. Typically, each phone needs to be programmed with the phone number and/or feature code needed to activate call forwarding, and each phone needs to be programmed with the forwarded phone number. In addition, each phone needs to be programmed with the conditions that trigger activation and de-activation of automatic call forwarding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> While the programming of call forwarding details can be relatively straightforward, different trigger conditions and many variations in the sequencing of data entry are possible. Manufacturers may choose to sell multiple phones that are pre-programmed to implement automatic call forwarding when the phones come in near proximity of one another. Alternately, programs running within a phone can be activated to implement call forwarding with a similarly equipped phone upon the receipt of the first beacon message from the similarly-equipped phone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Once a set of phones is programmed to work with each other, call forwarding between the phones is automatic, based on the proximity relationships of the phones. For example, consider <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> again. Preferably, phones <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are initially programmed to forward calls to wireless phone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> whenever phone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is outside the range of the low-range transceivers in phones <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Thus, if a user has his/her cell phone in the car on the way to the office, calls intended for any of the three phones will be sent to wireless phone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Later, when wireless phone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> comes in near proximity to landline phone <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (at the office, for example), phone <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and phone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> will pick up each other&apos;s beacon message over 2-way radio link <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and respond according to its own programming. The programming in landline phone <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> preferably directs landline phone <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to de-activate call forwarding to phone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, so that phone <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can receive it&apos;s own calls. The de-activation is preferably carried out by processor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, which directs conventional components <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to access service provider equipment <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> over transmission link <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Once connected, phone <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> sends the de-activation code to service provider equipment <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, using the established protocol to de-activate call forwarding, producing the same result a user would achieve if he/she manually deactivated call forwarding using the keypad included in conventional components <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The programming in wireless phone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> preferably directs wireless phone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to activate call forwarding to phone <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Processor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> within phone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> controls this by using traditional wireless components <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to access service provider equipment <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> over radio link <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, and by carrying out the established procedure to activate call forwarding to phone <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Thus, when phones <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> remain in proximity of one another, phone <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> receives its own calls as well all calls to phone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&mdash;including the calls forwarded to phone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> from phone <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Let&apos;s continue the example by considering what happens when wireless phone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> leaves the proximity of phone <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. This could occur when the user leaves the office to go on an errand or to go home. When the low-range transceivers go out of each other&apos;s range, phones <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> will sense the loss of each other&apos;s beacon message. In that situation, phone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> will de-activate call forwarding to phone <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and phone <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will activate call forwarding to phone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Thus, all calls to all three phones will be sent to phone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> again. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Continuing the example further, consider what happens if the user brings phone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> within near proximity of phone <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (at home, for example). Preferably processor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> in phone <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> will interpret the presence of the beacon message from phone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> over 2-way radio link <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> as a directive to de-activate call forwarding to phone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Phone <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> will de-activate in a manner analogous to how Phone <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> deactivated call forwarding to phone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, as discussed earlier. Similarly, phone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> will interpret the presence of the beacon message from phone <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> as a directive to activate call forwarding of its calls to phone <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and will do so in a manner analogous to that discussed earlier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> An enhancement to this invention is to allow users to suspend the preprogrammed call activation defaults, and later re-instate the pre-programmed defaults. Consider the suspend case. In the preceding example, just before the user goes home, while low-range transceivers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are still receiving each other&apos;s beacon message, the user could enter a code using the keypad of phone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to suspend call forwarding. This would preferably result in phone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> de-activating call forwarding to phone <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, even though phone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is in near-proximity of phone <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In addition, processor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> would direct low-range transceiver <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> to send a message to low-range transceiver <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to direct phone <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to not activate call forwarding when phone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> subsequently leaves the near proximity of phone <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The user could just as easily entered the suspend command using the keypad of phone <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In that case, phone <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> would take note to not activate call forwarding when phone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> goes out of proximity. Phone <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will also send a message to phone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, directing phone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to de-activate call forwarding to phone <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Thus, the present invention provides a method and apparatus for allowing phones to automatically forward calls intended for a first phone to a second phone based on the proximity of the phones to each other. In an exemplary embodiment, calls intended for a wireless phone while the wireless phone is in proximity to a landline phone are forwarded to the landline phone. This automatic call forwarding can be overridden by manually entering a key sequence into the wireless phone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a further exemplary embodiment of the present invention, when the wireless phone and the landline phone are no longer in proximity, calls intended for the wireless phone are no longer automatically forwarded to the landline phone. This is typically accomplished by having the wireless phone send a key sequence to the network infrastructure canceling the call forwarding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In a further exemplary embodiment, upon leaving the proximity of the landline phone, calls now intended for the landline phone are automatically forwarded to the wireless phone. This is preferably done by sending a key sequence from the landline phone to the network infrastructure. This forwarding is done automatically, but can be overridden by entering a key sequence into the landline phone to cancel the automatic call forwarding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> While this invention has been described in terms of certain examples thereof, it is not intended that it be limited to the above description, but rather only to the extent set forth in the claims that follow.</paragraph>
