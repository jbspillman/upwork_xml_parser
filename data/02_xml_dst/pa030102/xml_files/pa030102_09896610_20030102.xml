<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to software for a cooling and condensation control system. In particular, the present invention relates to a cooling system and condensation control system for computer logic modules. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> One of the factors that limit processing speed in computer systems is the generation of excessive heat at higher clock speeds. Significant gains of speed and reliability have been achieved by cooling computer logic modules down to temperatures below ambient. Unfortunately, cooling a logic module to below ambient temperatures can result in the formation of condensation, which is undesirable in a computer system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Prior attempts at providing a cooling system for a computer module have not been satisfactory for higher-end computing applications. For example, one approach has been to remove moisture from incoming air cooled to 5&deg; C. This approach requires handling a tremendous amount of water, and does not prevent condensation in an application where refrigerant may be operating as cold as &minus;40&deg; Celsius. Another approach has been to simply apply a fixed high-power heater around an evaporator unit which surrounds the logic module. In this way, the surface temperature of the logic module housing remains above the dew point. Another approach relies on enclosing the logic module in a vacuum enclosure as a means of providing effective insulation. Unfortunately, these approaches cannot adequately ensure that there will be no condensation in the evaporator housing and are therefore not sufficiently reliable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Another problem unresolved by prior art cooling systems relates to condensation formed on the opposite side of the circuit board. This problem has limited the temperatures to which the logic module can be cooled to avoid condensation. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The above discussed and other drawbacks and deficiencies of the prior art are overcome or alleviated by a refrigeration system including an evaporator housing including an evaporator block in thermal communication with the logic module. The evaporator housing includes a humidity sensor for detecting a humidity within the evaporator housing. The system further comprises a controller for controlling a refrigeration unit supplying cold refrigerant to the evaporator block in response to the operating conditions of the logic module and the temperature of the evaporator block. In another aspect of the invention, two modular refrigeration units are independently operable to cool the evaporator block, and each refrigeration unit is controllable in various modes of operation including an enabled mode in which it is ready to cool the evaporator and an on mode in which it is actively cooling the evaporator. In another aspect of the invention, the evaporator block and a heater on a reverse side of the circuit board are particularly controlled during concurrent repair operations. In another aspect of the invention, faulty sensors are recognized as such and an appropriate response is made. In another aspect of the invention, the system is shut down in a manner allowing rapid access to the logic module.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a schematic diagram providing an overview of the hardware components of exemplary refrigeration system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Refrigeration system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes redundant refrigeration units <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (two are shown) that sequentially or in unison provide coolant to evaporator <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> via refrigerant lines <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Although the cooling system will be described with reference to two refrigeration units <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, it will be understood that the invention can be adapted for use with one or more such refrigeration units. Evaporator <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is disposed over logic module <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and is in thermal communication therewith for cooling logic module <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to temperatures below ambient. Heat from logic module <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is absorbed by coolant in evaporator <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Coolant is then passed back to refrigeration units <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> where it is compressed, condensed, and expanded in any known refrigeration cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Logic module <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is preferably a multi-chip module, as are generally known in the art, but cooling system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is applicable to other concentrated heat generating devices that are advantageously maintained at below ambient temperatures. Logic module <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is electrically and mechanically attached to a first side <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of circuit board <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. Both logic module <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and circuit board <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> are relatively flat structures having heights that are substantially less than their widths or lengths, and are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> in profile view (i.e., disposed perpendicular to the page). To prevent condensation on a second side <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> of circuit board <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> from forming, a heater <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is disposed on second side <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> of circuit board <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. Heater <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> includes a heat spreader plate <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> in thermal communication with circuit board <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. Thermal pads <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) enhance thermal coupling between heat spreader plate <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and plated through-hole connections (not shown) of circuit board <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, effectively warming circuit board <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. Heater <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> further includes redundant heat cartridges <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to provide heat to heat spreader plate <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. Each heat cartridge <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> includes a resistive heat element (not shown) for converting electrical energy into heat energy. In a preferred embodiment, each heat cartridge is rated at 300 W. In addition to heat cartridges, other heat source types, such as flat resistive heaters, are contemplated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Each refrigeration unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes a respective controller <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in communication with a primary cage controller <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and secondary cage controller <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, the latter being available in case of failure of primary cage controller <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, via two-way communication lines <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. Controller <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> operates in response to instructions from primary cage controller <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> or secondary cage controller <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> to cool logic module <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to a desired temperature. In aid of this objective, controller <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is equipped with various outputs and inputs to control refrigeration equipment <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and to monitor the actual temperature of the evaporator. In addition to cooling logic module <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, controller <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is responsible for preventing condensation within evaporator <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and on circuit board <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. monitoring the temperature and relative humidity in the evaporator cavity (to be described in more detail below) and the temperature of heater <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, to ensure that it is greater than the dew point within the processor cage (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6, 7</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Controller <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> controls refrigeration equipment <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> within refrigeration unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> via signal lines <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, and controls heat cartridge <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> via lines <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. Evaporator plate temperature is provided via lines <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and evaporator cavity temperature and relative humidity are provided via lines <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, respectively. Finally, lines <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> provide heater temperature feedback. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Refrigeration units <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are modular in nature, i.e., they are interchangeable and provide redundancy or backup capabilities to evaporator <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Refrigerant lines <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and refrigerant return lines <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> are connected to refrigeration unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> via respective quick-disconnect couplings <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> so that either refrigeration unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be quickly swapped out for maintenance or replacement once another refrigeration unit is on line. Refrigeration units <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> each include a condenser and compressor, as is known in the refrigeration art, and passes pressurized refrigerant, which may exist as a liquid, gas, or mixed-phase fluid to evaporator <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> via refrigerant lines <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. In a preferred embodiment, the compressor is a Maneurop LT-22 compressor, but any rotary, reciprocating, or scroll compressor of sufficient cooling capacity could be used. The precise refrigeration cycle and working fluid is determined based on a number of factors, such as the desired resultant temperature, environmental/regulatory considerations, desired coefficient of performance, desired size of condenser, cost, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, an exemplary cooling cycle using R507 (AZ50) refrigerant provides temperatures as cold as &minus;40&deg; C. and colder. As would be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the target temperature may vary with the compression ratio and other factors, including various control measures as will be hereinafter described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In the exemplary arrangement shown, a mixture of gas and liquid refrigerant are passed to evaporator block <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> via refrigerant line <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Evaporator block <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> comprises copper, aluminum, or other heat conductive material and includes independent serpentine paths <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> formed therein. Serpentine paths <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are circuitous pathways that may be formed by any known method, such as by cutting paths into a center layer that is then sealed between upper and lower layers of the material. Exemplary evaporator block structures are shown and described in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 5,970,731 to Hare et al, issued Oct. 26, 1999 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,035,655 also to Hare et al., issued Mar. 14, 2000, both of which are herein incorporated by reference. Evaporator block <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> includes an additional serpentine path <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> for connection with a second refrigeration unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Serpentine paths <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are separated and are not in fluid communication with each other so that one refrigeration unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be disconnected while the other continues to operate. Evaporator block <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is disposed in thermal communication with logic module <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> within evaporator <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 3</cross-reference>) so that heat from logic module <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is readily absorbed by refrigerant in serpentine paths <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Upon absorbing heat from logic module <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) the refrigerant vaporizes and is passed back to refrigeration unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> via refrigerant return line <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. This gaseous refrigerant is passed to compressor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> via line <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, compressed therein, and then passed to condenser <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> via line <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>, wherein it is condensed back into a liquid or mixed phase fluid. Blower <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is driven by a variable A.C. motor or D.C. motor and pulls air through electronic controller <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and condenser <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> in a path generally represented by arrow <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> for absorbing the heat from the refrigerant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> After being condensed in condenser <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, the coolant is received in filter/drier tank <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> via line <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, then passed to expansion valve <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> where a portion of the coolant is vaporized and its temperature is reduced. The coolant is then once again made available to evaporator <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> via line <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>. A bypass line <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> is provided between lines <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> for bypassing the condenser and expansion valve in order to moderate the coolant&apos;s temperature. Bypass line <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> includes hot gas bypass valve <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, actuated by solenoid <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Controller <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> includes a processor and memory, as will be further described, for executing machine code to control the operation of refrigeration unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Control unit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> includes various inputs for temperature and humidity sensors in evaporator <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, to be described in more detail below, and outputs to control compressor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, bypass valve <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, and blower <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> via lines <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>, respectively. Any of lines <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> may carry control signals for actuating a relay or motor controller (not shown) which switches on and off power to the respective component, or such relay/motor controller may be internal to controller <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and lines <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> carry power to the respective components, in the known manner. The power supply and power lines are not illustrated for sake of clarity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Additionally, refrigeration unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes outputs for controlling heat cartridge <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 3</cross-reference>) and an input for receiving electrical power for supplying energy to controller <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, as well as compressor <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, blower <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, and solenoid <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a cross section view of an exemplary implementation of an evaporator <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and heater <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> assembled with a logic module <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and circuit board <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. Circuit board <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is provided with stiffeners <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> on either side to aid in supporting and attaching evaporator <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and heater <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to circuit board <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. Evaporator <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is attached to a first side <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of circuit board <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and heater <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is attached to a second side of circuit board <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> by screws <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> connected to stiffener <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> as shown. Refrigerant line <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and refrigerant return line <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> supplies one of two serpentine paths <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). A second pair of refrigerant and refrigerant return lines lie directly behind lines <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> shown, allowing connection to an additional refrigeration unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Refrigerant line <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and refrigerant return line <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> are connected to evaporator block <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> which is in thermal communication with logic module <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Evaporator block and logic module <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are sealed in an evaporator housing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> by gasket <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. After assembly, Evaporator cavity <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is filled with insulation, such as an injected polymer foam insulation, to reduce the amount of heat absorbed from evaporator housing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, thus preventing the temperature of evaporator housing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> from dropping below dew point.

Air is drawn into processor cage <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> at air inlet <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Air flows past memory books <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and redundant power supplies (not shown) along path <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. Air is then forced though one of a plurality of blowers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> (only one shown). Blower <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> includes louvers <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> which operate as check valves to prevent back flow through blower <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> when fewer than all blowers are operating.

Non-volatile memory <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> may be any type of machine readable media such as ROM, PROM, EPROM, EEPROM, Flash, magnetic media, optical media, or other known type of non-volatile memory. Communications port <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> is preferably a standard serial port, as are generally known in the industry, such as the RS422 serial port. Each of these components are in communication with processor <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> via one or more data busses <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> (only one shown). </paragraph>

As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, controllers <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are in communication with primary and secondary cage controllers <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. Additionally, cage controllers <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, which are also intelligent devices, are in communication with other controllers and sensors via Ethernet (see line <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) as generally known and understood in the art. Cage controllers <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> are responsible for monitoring and regulating the power supply, cooling fans, internal processor cage temperature, and other environmental aspects of the processor cage to ensure proper functioning of the system and the various internal components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The use of an intelligent refrigeration unit controller allows the refrigeration unit to cooperate with the cage controller and larger system to maximize the performance of the logic module without sacrificing reliability. In this regard the controller can, in response to instructions from cage controller <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, precisely control the temperature of the evaporation block by controlling the speed of compressor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and by actuating hot gas bypass valve <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) in response to temperature readings from evaporator block temperature probe <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. The temperature to which the evaporator block is controlled may vary according to the current condition or operation of the logic module operating mode or power consumption, as well as the expected condition or operation of the logic module. In addition, the refrigeration unit controller is capable of reacting to component failures and notifying the cage controller of such failures. This provides improved reliability by allowing the cage controller to then switch to a second refrigeration unit and alert system administrators of the failure for repair or replacement of the defective component and/or refrigeration unit. Furthermore, by integrating the refrigeration unit with the cage controller, smooth transitions from one refrigeration unit to another can be easily achieved.

<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The system and the individual refrigeration units are capable of entering several different modes of operation to accomplish this task as summarized by Table 1. These modes will now be described with reference to an exemplary system capable of being connected to only two refrigeration units at any one time, though it should be understood that the system may be adapted to accommodate any number of refrigeration units. In the &ldquo;N-mode,&rdquo; one refrigeration unit is on while the other refrigeration unit is either off or deactivated. When in the off-mode, the refrigeration unit is not operating to cool the logic module, but it is actively communicating with cage controller <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. When in the deactivated-mode, the refrigeration unit is off-line or disconnected. In the N&plus;1 mode, the first refrigeration unit is on, while the second is &ldquo;enabled&rdquo;. In the enabled mode, a refrigeration unit is not functioning to cool the logic module, and it is in communication with cage controller <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. What distinguishes &ldquo;enabled&rdquo; from &ldquo;off&rdquo; is that when enabled, the refrigeration unit is ready to step in and turn on, by itself and without instruction from the cage controller, if necessary. The conditions under which an enabled refrigeration unit may turn on by itself include sensing evaporator over-temperature and the cage controller didn&apos;t turn it on. A third mode of the system is the &ldquo;switchover&rdquo; mode. In a switchover mode, one refrigeration unit is designated the &ldquo;switchover-from&rdquo; unit, indicating that it is in a shut-down sequence, and one refrigeration unit is in a &ldquo;switchover-to&rdquo; mode, indicating that it is in a start-up sequence. The shutdown and startup sequences vary depending on whether the switchover-from unit is experiencing a fatal error or whether the switchover-from unit is running normally or experiencing only a minor error. A minor error is one that can be compensated, an example of which will be described below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Each controller <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> makes status data available to the cage controller <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, and the cage controller <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> periodically transmits status data and instructions to the refrigeration unit controllers <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. This periodic data transmission is called &ldquo;stuffage&rdquo; and allows the refrigeration units to react to failures of the cage controllers, while the cage controllers&apos; monitoring of refrigeration unit data allows them to react to failures of the refrigeration units in a logical manner. In the exemplary embodiment, refrigeration unit controller <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> sends posts the value of all the sensors of the refrigeration unit, particularly the evaporator and heater block temperatures, flags indicating the mode the refrigeration unit is currently in, and fault data, such as evaporator cavity over-humidity, heater block over-temperature, etc. This information is available to the cage controller to read. Every 7 seconds or so, the cage controller <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> stuffs the refrigeration unit with data including the current power of the logic module, ambient temperature, control commands such as turn on/off, prepare for power on, prepare for self test, enter enable mode, enter/exit switch-over-to mode, enter/exit switch-over-from mode, fault flags control commands to set or clear fault flags in the refrigeration unit controller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> During operation, cage controller <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> determines the set point for the refrigeration units. The set point is the desired temperature of evaporator block, and is dependent on the requirements of the logic module and the mode of operation and power draw of the logic module. For example, during start up operation, the set point is initially set to a high temperature of, e.g., 0&deg; C. which may be designated a standby temperature. During self-test or periods of low current draw, the set point is set to an intermediate temperature to avoid condenstaion, e.g., &minus;10&deg; C. During normal operation, the set point is set to a low temprature, e.g., &minus;20&deg; C. It may be necessary to raise the set point during periods of low power dissipation in the logic module to ensure the surface temperature of the portion of the circuit board outside the sealed environment does not rise above the dew point. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> provides a flow chart diagram describing an exemplary start-up sequence. This represents code in refrigeration unit controller <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and is particularly directed towards starting up the compressor without drawing excessive current from the power supply. The procedure begins at start block <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and proceeds immediately to block <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> which instructs the hot gas bypass valve <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) to open to unload the compressor. Compressor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) is driven to a relatively slow speed of about 2700 r.p.m. The hot gas bypass valve <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is then pulsed by opening, closing, then opening again, to ensure that it is functioning properly. By employing pulse width modulation, the hot gas bypass valve is ramped to 100% closed at block <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>. At about 81 seconds from start-up, the compressor speed is advanced to 50 Hz, which is equivalent to 3000 rpm at block <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>. In block <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> PID (proportional, integral, derivative) control of the evaporator block temperature then begins at about <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> seconds after startup and the heater is powered to 60% on (e.g., using pulse width modulation with about 2 second cycle time). Block <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> begins thermal regulation and at block <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, the logic thread terminates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The cage controller prepares for changes in logic state and sets the set point prior to the change, but not for so long as to create condensation. For example, in order for the logic module to function at optimum cycle time, it should already be chilled to its planned temperature condition. Therefore, the logic code must first request a low temperature state, then wait for the cage controller and refrigeration unit to provide that state, e.g., by changing the set point. Once the set point is achieved, the refrigeration unit sets a status bit for the cage controller to read, thus indicating that it has achieved status. The status bit may be indicative of an evaporator block temperature being within a selected range, e.g., 2&deg; C. or 5&deg; C., of the set point. Once the cage controller notices that the status bit is set, it gives permission to the logic code to operate at the faster cycle time. If the cage controller or refrigeration unit notices that the logic module failed to increase its cycle time within a selected time frame, e.g., anywhere from 20 seconds to 2 minutes, it will reset the set point to the high or medium temperature, to avoid condensation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> represents code in cage controller <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> that is executed prior to &ldquo;clocks-on&rdquo; mode, i.e., prior to running logic module at its optimum speed. This procedure begins with block <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> and proceeds immediately to block <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> wherein one of refrigeration units <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is turned on. The unit to be turned on may be selected at random, or otherwise. At block <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight>, the set point temperature T is initially set to high, which may correspond to 0&deg; C. At block <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight>, cage controller <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> then waits for the status bit in refrigeration unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as described above.

Then, at block <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>, cage controller gives the higher-level code the go-ahead for clocks-on, and the procedure terminates at block <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight>. If clocks-on fails to commence within a selected time-frame, e.g., 2 minutes, then the set point is returned to the intermediate value to prevent over-cooling of the circuit board. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Each refrigeration unit controller <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> monitors its individual humidity sensor or its independent output of dual humidity and temperature sensor <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to ensure that it remains within normal limits. If the sensor output is outside the normal limits of the sensor probe, controller <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> sets an error flag indicating that the sensor is &ldquo;insane&rdquo;. Higher level system code monitors the error flags from refrigerator unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Upon detecting the error, the higher level system code will message a system operator that the humidity sensor needs to be replaced, as described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Sometimes, a humidity sensor will slowly drift from the correct reading, rather than returning an insane value. To detect a faulty sensor that is merely inaccurate, rather than insane, cage controller <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> compares the actual sensor values together when one of refrigeration units <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> indicates an over humidity condition. If the difference between the readings is beyond a miscompare limit, e.g., 5% relative humidity, the higher-reading humidity sensor is flagged as defective and the operator is requested to replace the dual humidity and temperature sensor <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. If the difference between the readings is within the miscompare limit, then a dry air breach warning is surfaced and a repair is requested of this condition. In an alternate embodiment, dual humidity and temperature sensor <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is replaced with a pressure sensor. This would protect against failures of the seal around evaporator cavity <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, but would not insure against moisture diffusion through the various elastomeric membranes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the output of the thermistors in dual humidity and temperature sensor <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are used to correct the sensed relative humidity value for evaporator cavity <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> in accordance with the manufacturer&apos;s specifications. It is this temperature-corrected relative humidity value that is used for fault detection and isolation. The correction is required since the local air temperature around dual humidity and temperature sensor <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> varies with ambient as well as with the temperature set point in evaporator <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Concurrent maintenance, i.e., maintenance during continued operation of the logic module, of the dual humidity and temperature sensor <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> (humidity sensor) is accomplished by deactivating the humidity sensor. In this case, &ldquo;deactivating&rdquo; the humidity sensor means causing heat cartridge <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to thermostatically control the board temperature to a higher than normal value to prevent moisture from forming thereon when evaporator cavity <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is opened for the short time needed to replace humidity sensor <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Refrigeration unit controller <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> sets a timer when the humidity sensor is deactivated and gives a warning signal if the repair procedure takes too long. For example, if the evaporator cavity is opened for more than 10 minutes, an audible alarm is produced, or a warning message is sent to cage controller <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. If the amount of dry air supplied from desiccant canister <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is increased while evaporator cavity <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is opened, then this time may be increased. For example, capillary tube <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> may be replaced with a pair of differently-sized orifices, with a valve and actuating mechanism, to allow increased air flow while the humidity sensor is being serviced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> While dual humidity and temperature sensor <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is being replaced, the internal desiccant bag is also replaced so that any moisture that enters evaporator cavity <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> during this procedure is removed. Once dual humidity and temperature sensor <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is replaced, it is &ldquo;activated&rdquo; and the heaters are returned to normal power. Refrigeration unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> then resumes normal monitoring of the relative humidity levels in evaporator cavity <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Temperature sensors <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are monitored for sanity in a manner similar to the way the humidity sensors are monitored. For example, if the heaters are more than 10&deg; C. apart in their temperature measurements, a miscompare fault flag is set, and one or both sensors are replaced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Outputs of temperature sensors <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are also compared with over and under temperature limits. These limits are a function of other system states or environmental conditions. A temperature outside the range defined by the over and under limits, could indicate a faulty heater, connection, or drive circuit. A defect in the running refrigeration unit triggers a switchover to the other (good) refrigeration unit. The defective heat cartridge and thermistor is concurrently replaced by first deactivating the heater, causing the good running refrigeration unit to thermostatically control the heater to a lower, touchable temperature. As with the humidity sensor, a timer is set as a result of the heater deactivating command. Sufficient time is allotted for replacing heat cartridge <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and thermistor <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, but not so much time as to permit moisture to form on critical surfaces. For example, the timer may be set for 10 minutes, after which an alarm sounds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Each refrigeration unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> controls its own heat cartridge <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, and the heat value is controlled from no heat to full heat, up to 300 W, if heat cartridge <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is a 300 W heater. Heat cartridge <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is controlled by pulse width modulation at a frequency fast enough compared to the thermal mass of heat cartridge <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> that prevents temperature cycling and related heater failure, e.g., 2 Hz has been found to be a sufficiently fast frequency. Unique heat values are used for particular power and environmental states. In a method described by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the heater power is reduced for high ambient air temperature conditions. Ambient temperature is measured within the refrigeration unit enclosure at the inlet to condenser <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) using a thermistor. This thermistor is tested for sanity in the same manner as temperature sensor <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> described above. Starting with block <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> refrigeration unit controller <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> proceeds immediately to block <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> and determines whether the thermistor at the inlet of condenser <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is insane. If not, controller <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> proceeds to block <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> wherein the condenser inlet temperature is taken as the ambient temperature, and controller <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> proceeds to block <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. If the thermistor is insane, then the ambient temperature is set to the ambient temperature from a thermistor mounted on the system frame, which is provided in stuffage from cage controller <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. A compensation value is added to this value since the frame temperature will typically be several degrees cooler than the air entering condenser <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, due to the environment in refrigeration unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Controller <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> then proceeds to block <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> At block <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, controller <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> tests whether the ambient temperature is less than 30&deg; C. If so, heat cartridge <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is set to 60% of maximum and blower <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) is set to 2,000 rpm. Then, the procedure terminates at block <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. If the ambient temperature is greater than 30&deg; C., the heat cartridge is set to only 30% of maximum and the blower is set to 2,800 rpm, to compensate for warmer ambient air. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Switchover from one refrigeration unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to another refrigeration unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can occur on a scheduled basis, for example, every 160 hours. In addition, switchover can be for recovery purposes, i.e., when one refrigeration unit is faulty. In particular, a recovery switchover may be in response to such failures as double communications fault to the on refrigeration unit, temperature sensor <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> insane, over temperature, or under temperature, or dual humidity and temperature sensor insane or over humidity. A double communication fault occurs when both cage controller <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and secondary cage controller <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> lose communication with the on refrigeration unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In a switch-over mode, cage controller <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> posts switching-from and switching-to bits in stuffage to respective refrigeration units <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, then posts a &ldquo;switchover&rdquo; function bit. The switching-from refrigeration unit compressor is set to maximum speed and its hot gas bypass valve is closed (0%) to prepare for turning on the switching-to refrigeration unit. After a short pause, the switching-to refrigeration unit is turned on, causing significant heat to be passed to evaporator block <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> during startup. The switching-to unit set point is then set a small amount lower (e.g., 1&deg; C.) than the set point of the switching-from refrigeration unit, causing the switching-to unit to be taxed to a greater extent as the switching-from unit dumps heat through its hot gas bypass valve in an effort to bring the temperature up to its set point. Switching-to and switching-from refrigeration units are designed to be capable of maintaining this &ldquo;switch-over&rdquo; mode indefinitely. However, the switching-from refrigeration unit is kept on for a selected period of time, e.g., 4 minutes. The switching-from refrigeration unit is then turned off only after the switching-to unit exhibits no fault or warning conditions. After good status, the cage controller shuts down the switching-from refrigeration unit, and places it in enabled mode, then clears the switchover mode and function bit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In the case of a recovery switchover, there is no pause in bringing the switching-to refrigeration unit to the set point temperature, and once achieved, the switching from refrigeration unit is immediately shut down. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> When a system is powered off after the logic module has been chilled to below zero, there is a danger that condensation will form when the evaporator is removed to service the logic module. To prevent such condensation from forming, cage controller <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> sends the running refrigeration unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> a &ldquo;prepare-for-power-off&rdquo; command, causing it to open its hot gas bypass valve <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, causing high enthalpy refrigerant to pass directly into the evaporator and thus rapidly heating the evaporator, as well as the logic module it is attached to. To further accelerate the heating of the chilled logic unit and circuit board, heat cartridge <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is left on. These steps enable logic module <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to be serviced in an acceptable timeframe without danger of condensation being formed on the vulnerable areas. </paragraph>
