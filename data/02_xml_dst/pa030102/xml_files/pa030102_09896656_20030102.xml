<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a ferroelectric polymer storage device including a ferroelectric polymer structure that is sandwiched between an array of electrodes that achieve electrical signaling across the ferroelectric polymer structure. With the knowledge of the ferromagnetic qualities of such polymers, the inventors ventured to take advantage of the ability to orient ferromagnetic polymer layers as a data storage device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In some applications, the ferroelectric polymer structure may preferably be patterned. Because of lower power incentives, the inventors looked to reducing the voltage that is required to perform reads and writes to the ferroelectric polymer (FEP) structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The switching voltage and switching speed of an FEP structure may depend on the thickness of the FEP structure, the local polymer chain length, as well as the micro-local morphology of the structure. Ferroelectric behavior in a polymer material is attributed to transverse dipole moments in the molecule. For example, a fluorine-based polymer may have a transverse dipole moment formed by positive hydrogen and negative fluorine atoms that are in the trans configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Ferroelectric properties are discoverable below the temperature of the ferroelectric phase transition, which is the working temperature upper limit. Below this temperature, the main chain of a ferroelectric polymer may be arranged in the substantially all-trans configuration such that dipole moments are parallel, at least, within ferroelectric domains that are separated from each other by domain walls. Ferroelectric polymers form chain lengths that may be in the range of about one micro meter (micron). Accordingly, when the dipole moment is reversed from one state to the opposite, the entire chain is affected. Therefore, a longer chain will require a greater power input in order to get the entire chain to reverse its dipole. In any event, the longer the polymer chain, the more resistant it will be to a significant dipole reversal. Consequently, a longer polymer chain may cost a greater amount of power and dipole-switching time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The following description includes terms, such as upper, lower, first, second, etc. that are used for descriptive purposes only and are not to be construed as limiting. The embodiments of an apparatus or article of the present invention described herein can be manufactured, used, or shipped in a number of positions and orientations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Reference will now be made to the drawings wherein like structures will be provided with like reference designations. In order to show the structures of the present invention most clearly, the drawings included herein are diagrammatic representations of integrated circuit structures. Thus, the actual appearance of the fabricated structures, for example in a photomicrograph, may appear different while still incorporating the essential structures of the present invention. Moreover, the drawings show only the structures necessary to understand the present invention. Additional structures known in the art have not been included to maintain the clarity of the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, one embodiment relates to the patterning of an FEP layer into discrete, spaced apart FEP structures. The ferroelectric polymer storage device may be referred to as a cross-point matrix polymer memory structure. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates a process flow embodiment in which a polymer memory device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is being fabricated. A substrate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is depicted with a conductive layer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and a patterned mask <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. Substrate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be an interlayer dielectric (ILD) material such as silicon oxide substrate or a silicon substrate, respectively. Substrate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may also be an ILD such as a polyimide material as is known in the art. Mask <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is provided for patterning conductive layer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> into a first or lower electrode <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and first mask <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> may be a spin-on resist as is known in the art. First electrode <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> may be formed by physical vapor deposition (PVD) or chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of any material that is suitable as an electrical conductor according to electrical conductors known in the art. In one embodiment, first electrode <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is an aluminum material. The thickness and width of first electrode <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> may depend upon the specific lithography and design rules. Under certain thermal budgets or other applications, first electrode <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> may be formed by CVD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Etching to form first electrode <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> may be carried out under conditions such as with an anisotropic etch recipe that is selective to first mask <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and to substrate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Depending upon the materials, the lithography, and the design rules, various etch recipes may be selected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates further processing as viewed in elevational cross section. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> depicts a rectilinear cross section of first electrode <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> with four surfaces. An FEP layer <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is formed over first electrode <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> in a manner that contacts first electrode <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> upon three of four surfaces; an upper surface <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, a first vertical surface <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, and a second vertical surface <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The fourth surface rests upon substrate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> also illustrates that a second mask <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> has been patterned over FEP layer <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> in preparation for further processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates the effect of patterning of FEP layer <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Thereby, a segmented, elongated FEP structure <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> is formed out of the FEP layer <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). Further, first electrode <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is contacted by segmented, elongated FEP structure <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> on three of four surfaces when viewed in the manner illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is an elevational oblique view of memory device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> during further processing that illustrates segmented, elongated FEP structures <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> in an array of first electrodes <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. First electrode <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is protected from possible shorting by the overlap of FEP structure <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> onto substrate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> that covers upper surface <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, first vertical surface <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, and second vertical surface <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a top plan schematic view of memory device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> during fabrication that also illustrates segmented, elongated FEP structures <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> as they cover first electrodes <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> (not visible) that are disposed upon substrate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is viewable along the section line <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. The formation of segmented, elongated FEP structures <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> may be carried out in an oxygen plasma process that attenuates exposed portions of FEP layer <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Oxygen plasma processing is known in the art and may be carried out at ambient temperature and pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is also a top plan schematic view of memory device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> after further processing of memory device <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. A second or upper electrode <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is illustrated as being patterned in what may be referred to as a cross-point configuration with first electrode <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> (not visible). Second electrode <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may also be an electrically conductive material like first electrode <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. The formation of second electrode <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may be carried out by a PVD process that is sensitive to preserving the physical qualities of the FEP structure. Patterning of second electrode <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may be carried out by etching as is known in the art. It is noted that the etch recipe may be selective to segmented, elongated FEP structure <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> as well as to substrate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Etch conditions required to form second electrode <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may be the same as etch conditions required to form first electrode <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is an elevational cross-section view of memory device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> as taken along the section line <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> after further processing. Second electrode <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is disposed above and on substrate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Segmented, elongated FEP structure <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> is both abutting and above and on first electrode <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. Similarly, second electrode <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is both abutting and above and on segmented, elongated FEP structure <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> illustrates the use of segmented, elongated FEP structure <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> as an insulator to prevent shorting of first electrode <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and second electrode <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> illustrates memory device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> after further processing. A second etch has been carried out to further remove FEP material that is laterally exposed between the array of electrodes <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the FEP structure that is depicted as segmented, elongate FEP structure <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> has been further patterned with the use of second electrode <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> as a mask. As before, further removal of exposed FEP material may be carried out in an ambient oxygen plasma etch as is known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The achievement of discrete, spaced-apart FEP structures <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is further illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is an elevational oblique view of memory device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> after processing as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. It can be seen that discrete, spaced-apart FEP structures <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> have been self-aligned beneath second electrodes <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> after etch processing such as the oxygen plasma etch. Substrate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is depicted as being a support surface that makes contact with first electrode <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, discrete, spaced-apart FEP structures <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, and second electrode <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> After the formation of discrete, spaced-apart FEP structures <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, further processing may be carried out by forming a protective film <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> over the electrodes as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. Blanket formation of protective film <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> may be done such as by spin-on processing of a polyimide material as is known in the art. In another embodiment, an inorganic material may be deposited, subject only to avoiding temperature elevation that will compromise the quality of discrete, spaced-apart FEP structures <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. For example atomic layer CVD (ALCVD) may be carried out according to known technique. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> also illustrates the achievement of a configuration that may be referred to as a &ldquo;cross point&rdquo; <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. In other words, the cross point <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> or projection of the width W, of first electrode <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> upward onto second electrode <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> exposes an area of discrete, spaced-apart FEP structure <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> that is about equivalent to the square of width W if second electrode <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> also has a width of about width W. The amount of discrete, spaced-apart FEP structure <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> that is within this projected area may be most susceptible of being written to and read from as a memory element embodiment. The cross point <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> of polymer memory device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may have a dimension in the X-direction that may be tied to a particular minimum-feature mask technology. For example, photolithography process flows may have minimum features that are 0.25 micrometers (microns), 0.18 microns, 0.13 microns, and 0.11 microns. It is understood that the various metrics such as 0.25 microns may have distinctly different dimensions in one business entity from a comparative business entity. Accordingly, such metrics, although quantitatively called out, may differ between a given two business entities. Other minimum features that may be accomplished in the future are applicable to the present invention. It is also discernible from the illustrations that the first electrodes have a first width, the second electrodes have a second width, and a given discrete, spaced-apart polymer structure in the array of discrete, spaced-apart polymer structures has an area that is greater than the product of the first width and the second width. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> According to some embodiments of the present invention, at least one article quality is accomplished. Because of the present state of photolithographic minimum features, patterning to achieve a discrete, spaced-apart FEP structure may have a maximum feature that is smaller than the typical chain length of about one micron that is found within a domain wall of an FEP material. A lower voltage is required to cause the FEP structure to reorient due to the shorter chain length. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> A damascene technique may also be used in an embodiment. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> illustrates a damascene technique in which a memory device <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> during fabrication includes a substrate <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> with a first or lower electrode <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> disposed in the substrate <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. Processing may include formation of a recess <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, filling recess <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> with a first electrode layer (not illustrated), and carrying out a polish or etchback technique that forms first electrode <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> with an electrode upper surface <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> that is substantially coplanar with a substrate upper surface <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>. Reduction of the vertical profile may be carried out by mechanical polishing, chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP), chemical etchback, and the like. Thereafter, processing of an FEP layer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> may be carried out as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. </paragraph>

In this embodiment, as processing geometries grow smaller, the formation of a damascene first electrode <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> in substrate <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> may assist in preventing photolithographic focusing problems by presenting a reduced topology than the embodiment depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. After further processing, second electrode <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> is used as a mask to form discrete, spaced-apart FEP structures <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, it is also preferable to form a protective film <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> above an on the electrodes. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> illustrates a process flow embodiment that describes fabrication of a memory device that comprises an array of discrete, spaced-apart FEP structures. First, the process <highlight><bold>1600</bold></highlight> begins by forming <highlight><bold>1610</bold></highlight> a first electrode layout on a substrate. The substrate may be silicon with logic and other structures such as embedded memory.

<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> One embodiment of the present invention is a memory system. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> illustrates an elevational oblique view of part of a memory system <highlight><bold>1700</bold></highlight> that is inserted into a host (not pictured) according to an embodiment of the present invention. The memory system <highlight><bold>1700</bold></highlight> besides the host (not pictured) may include a polymer memory device <highlight><bold>1710</bold></highlight> disposed upon a substrate <highlight><bold>1712</bold></highlight> that may be microprocessor silicon, inorganic ILD material such as silicon oxide, organic ILD material such as polyimide, or others. Alternatively, substrate <highlight><bold>1712</bold></highlight> may be a board such as a fiberglass-resin (FR) card or motherboard including a current type referred to as FR4. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, the substrate <highlight><bold>1712</bold></highlight> is depicted as an FR board that may contain a chip set thereon. A physical interface <highlight><bold>1714</bold></highlight> for a host is also depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>.

Other embodiments of a signal interface <highlight><bold>1716</bold></highlight>B may include short-range radiant energy signals such as the technology commonly referred to as Bluetooth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The data storage portion of the inventive memory system <highlight><bold>1700</bold></highlight> may include the polymer memory device <highlight><bold>1710</bold></highlight> that is disposed on the substrate <highlight><bold>1712</bold></highlight>. As set forth herein, the polymer memory device <highlight><bold>1710</bold></highlight> may comprise a first electrode disposed on a substrate, an array of discrete, spaced FEP structures, and a second electrode as set forth herein. Other, more specific embodiments of the inventive memory system as set forth herein may be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Various physical interfaces may be employed with the inventive memory system <highlight><bold>1700</bold></highlight>, depending upon the appropriate host. The memory system <highlight><bold>1700</bold></highlight> may be employed with a physical interface that is configured to a host type selected from communications hosts such as a PCMCIA card interface, a personal data assistant (PDA) interface with or without wireless communication ability, and a hand-held host such as a cellular telephone.

<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> For example, a PCMCIA card has a physical interface comprising at least the long edges of the card that frictionally and slidingly connect with the card bay. The signal interface for a PCMCIA card comprises at least the female multi-contact sockets at the back of the card, and the specific plug-in outlets at the front of the card. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Low operating voltages are preferred and achieved by embodiments of the present invention. According to an embodiment, switching voltage may be in the range from about 0.5 V to less than about 9 V. Nonvolatile memory such as flash may require charge pump technology to achieve a sufficient voltage to write to the floating gate. The present invention presents a low-voltage technology for nonvolatile memory that may obviate the need for charge pump technology and other higher-voltage memory technologies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The switching speed under certain voltages for and FEP device may be mainly determined by the microstructure and geometry of the FEP structures. When there is sufficient nucleation of &bgr; phases, but domain-wall limited rather than nucleation limited under a reduced coercive field, and where the geometry of the FEP structure is efficiently defined by the cross-point geometry of the electrodes in the range of submicrons, the switching speed may be in the range of about one microsecond. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The following is an example of a method of making an embodiment of the present invention. The process technology relates to 0.25 micron processing. Reference may be made to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. To fabricate a polymer memory device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, a substrate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is provided, comprising logic-bearing silicon for an inventive cross-point polymer memory device. Substrate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may include an ILD dielectric material such as silicon oxide or an organic ILD material such as a polyimide or an FR board. Over substrate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, a conductive layer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is formed by CVD of aluminum or copper. A photoresist material is spun on exposed, and patterned to form first mask <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. Spin-on conditions include depositing the photoresist material as a fluid in a puddle prime onto substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for a period of from about 5 to 25 seconds and spinning substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and in a rotational range from about 300 rpm to about 6000 rpm and for a time range from about 5 seconds to about 20 seconds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> First mask <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> has a width of about 0.25 micron. Thereafter, an anisotropic etch is carried out that has an etch recipe selective to substrate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and first mask <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. First electrode <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is the result. Under similar spin-on conditions, an FEP material is spun on and cured over first electrode <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> to form an FEP layer <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. Additional photoresist is spun on, exposed, and patterned to form second mask <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, an oxygen plasma etch is carried out according to known technique at about 23&deg; C. and about one atmosphere. The oxygen plasma etch may also be referred to as a first patterning of an FEP structure. The etch effectively removes exposed FEP layer <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and leaves segmented, elongated FEP structures <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> A second electrically conductive layer is patterned into a series of second or upper electrodes <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Finally, a second oxygen plasma etch is carried out under similar conditions to remove any exposed FEP material. After the second oxygen plasma etch, discrete, spaced-apart FEP structures <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> are left that have a polymer chain length that is shorter that what normally occurs in typical spin-on FEP processing. The second oxygen plasma etch may be referred to as a second patterning of the FEP structure <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. Other processing may occur such as the formation of a polyimide protective layer <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The discrete, spaced-apart FEP structures <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> have a thickness from about 500 &angst; to about 2,000 &angst;, preferably about 1,000 &angst;. The discrete, spaced-apart FEP structures <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> comprise a copolymer of (CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&mdash;CF<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>&mdash;(CHF&mdash;CF<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>m </subscript></highlight>wherein n and m equal 1, and wherein n is about 0.75. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> According to this example, the cross-point matrix polymer memory device operates in a range below about 9 V, and preferably in a range from about 0.5 V to about 5 V. This voltage may relate to both the destructive read method and the write method according to an embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In a second example, all of the processing conditions of the first example are carried out with the modification that reference may be made to FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, first electrode <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is a damascene structure in substrate <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> It will be readily understood to those skilled in the art that various other changes in the details, material, and arrangements of the parts and method stages which have been described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of this invention may be made without departing from the principles and scope of the invention as expressed in the subjoined claims. </paragraph>
