<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an apparatus for forming die cuts. More particularly, the present invention relates to an apparatus for holding a die cutting blade having a desired pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Die cuts are preformed pieces of paper or other cuttable material that are cut into a desired shape. For example, die cuts are often available in various shapes such as teddy bears, hearts, stars, etc. Multiple die cuts are usually packaged together for consumer purchase and may include die cuts formed from various colors of paper. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The die cuts are formed by pressing a blade, which has been formed into the desired shape, against a sheet of paper or any other cuttable material to cut or punch out a section of the paper or other material corresponding to the shape of the blade. The blade is held in position by a block of wood. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, such die cutting blocks <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are typically comprised of a block of wood <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> which has a desired pattern laser cut into the wood block <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The laser cutting process forms a channel <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in the wood block <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for receiving a die cutting blade <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The channel <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> extends completely through the wood block <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> but is discontinuous at points <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to keep the interior &ldquo;cut out&rdquo; portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of the wood block intact with the remainder of the block <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. A preformed blade <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, having a generally rectangular shape, bent to have the same pattern as the pattern cut in the wood block <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is then inserted into the channel <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> formed therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Typically, the wood block <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is approximately &frac58; to &frac34; inches in thickness and the blade <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is approximately 1 inch in width. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In order to ensure that the blade <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> remains secured within the channel, the blade <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is essentially press fitted within the channel <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Moreover, the desired shape is typically formed from several sections of blade <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, each of which must be individually and precisely forced into the channel <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. In order to insert the blade members, a skilled laborer must pound each of the individual blade members into the channel by hand. The blade <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is forced into the wood block <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> until the back edge <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the blade <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is substantially flush with or even extending slightly beyond the back side <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the wood block <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, leaving a portion of the blade <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> extending above the top surface <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the wood block <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. With the exception of laser cutting the channel <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> into the block <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, such die cutting blocks <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> have been manufactured in this manner for decades with little, if any, improvement in the manufacturing or assembly processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> This process of manufacturing such a die cutting instrument is time consuming and labor intensive. As such, the cost to manufacture each die cutting block is relatively high. The retail price of such die cutting blocks have an average retail price of approximately $120 dollars. The primary market for such die cutting blocks are commercial establishments that produce their own sets of die cuts or commercial establishments that allow their customers to use their die cutting machines to create die cuts for a fee. There has not been a die cutting system designed specifically for personal or home use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Thus, it would be advantageous to provide a die cutting block that is easy to manufacture, easy to assemble, and relatively inexpensive. It would further be advantageous to provide a die cutting block that can be manufactured at a price that makes it accessible to the average consumer for home use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> These and other advantages will become apparent from a reading of the following summary of the invention and description of the preferred embodiments in accordance with the principles of the present invention. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Referring to the drawings wherein like numerals indicate like elements throughout, there is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference> a die cutting block, generally indicated at <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, in accordance with the principles of the present invention. The die cutting block is comprised of a base portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, an insert portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and a blade <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> extending above the top surfaces <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of the base portion and insert portion, respectively. The blade <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is rigidly held between the base portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the insert portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The base portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and insert portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> when pressed together against the blade <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, which is interposed therein between, prevent the blade from become dislodged once the die cutting block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is assembled in accordance with the principles of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>B, which shows the back side of the die cutting block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the back surface <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> of the insert portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is substantially flush with the back surface <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> of the base portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, the base portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and insert portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are formed with cavities <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, respectively, to limit the amount of material necessary to form the die cutting block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. In this preferred embodiment, the base portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and insert portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are formed from plastic, such as ABS high impact styrene. The base portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> includes an outer wall <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> which depends from the top plate <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> and extends around the perimeter of the base portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The base portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> also includes an inner wall <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> which provides structural support for the blade (not visible) and thus has an inner contour <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> to substantially match the contour of the blade. Likewise, the insert portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> has an outer wall <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> which extends around the perimeter of the insert portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> having an outer contour <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> which is configured to substantially match the inner contour <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> of the inner wall <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. Indeed, it is preferable that the inner wall <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and the outer wall <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> proximate the back side <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> of the base portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> form an interference fit (i.e., fit tightly together when the insert portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is fully inserted into the base portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the base portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and insert portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are formed by an injection molding process such as those injection molding processes known in the art. Unlike the prior art die cutting blocks which are formed from wood, the molded plastic components of the present invention provide for much higher production rates for the plastic components as well as allow for the use of less expensive materials (i.e., such plastic parts are much cheaper than similar parts made from wood). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In this preferred embodiment, the blade <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> has been formed into the outline of a teddy bear <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 112</cross-reference>. This particular <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 112</cross-reference> is presented by way of example only and is not intended in any way to limit the scope of the present invention. Upon review of the present invention as described herein, those of skill in the art will quickly appreciate that the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 112</cross-reference> may comprise any conceivable shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The die cutting block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is utilized to cut paper into the shape of the figure by pressing the blade <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> against a sheet or sheets of paper (not shown). The pressing action may be performed with various die cut pressing machines known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the base portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> has a top plate <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> which forms the top surface <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. The base portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> defines an aperture <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> which is configured to receive the blade <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>) having a desired shape, in this case the outline of a teddy bear. Recessed within the aperture <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is a lip or ledge <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> which extends around the interior <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> of the aperture <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. The ledge <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> is spaced from the top surface <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and provides an abutment for supporting the blade <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and preventing it from falling through or being forced through the back side of the base portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, which illustrates the back side of the insert portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, the back surface <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> defines the outer contour <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> configured to match the inner contour <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> defined by the ledge <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> of the base portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The outer wall <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> of the insert portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> defines a recess or inset which extends around the perimeter of the back surface <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. When the insert portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is inserted into the base portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the outer contour <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> of the back surface <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> fits within the inner contour <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> of the ledge <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. Likewise, the outer perimeter <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> of the insert portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is sized and shaped to fit within and substantially match the contour of the interior <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> of the aperture <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> of the base portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. While the outer contour <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> fits snugly within the inner contour <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>, the outer perimeter <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is spaced away from the interior surface <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> of the aperture <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> so as to allow clearance for receiving the blade <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> therein between. The blade <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, however, fits tightly between the insert portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and the base portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> so that when the insert portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is fully inserted into the base portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, neither the blade <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> nor the insert portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> can be easily removed from the base portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows an exploded cross-sectional side view of the die cutting block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in accordance with the principles of the present invention. In order to assemble the die cutting block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the base portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is placed upon a supporting surface (not shown). The blade <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is then inserted into the base portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. In this example, the blade <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is formed from two mirrored sections of blade, each comprising half of the desired shape of the figure. Thus, one half of the blade <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is inserted into the right side <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> of the base portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the other half of the blade (not shown) would be inserted into the left side of the base (not shown). Those of skill in the art will appreciate that the blade may be comprised of one or more segments. The blade <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> will then rest upon the ledge <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. As illustrated, the blade <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is preformed to substantially match the interior contoured surface <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> of the base portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Once inserted, a top portion <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> of the blade <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> will extend above the top surface <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> of the base portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The insert portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is then inserted into the base portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> such that the blade <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is interposed between the interior contoured surface <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> of the base portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the outer contoured surface <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> of the insert portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The insert portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is then forced into the base portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> as by applying pressure or an abrupt force to the top surface <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> of the insert portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The insert portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is forced into the base portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> until the abutment surface <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> contacts the ledge <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. Conversely, the insert portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> could be inserted into the base portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the blade <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> then inserted into the space between the base portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the insert portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Still yet, the blade <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> may be pressed onto the outside of the insert portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and the assembled blade and insert then inserted into the base portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7, a</cross-reference> die cutting block <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in accordance with the principles of the present invention include a blade <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> having nearly any conceivable shape. In this case, the blade <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is configured to form a simple circular shape. The blade <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is wedged and thus tightly secured between the base portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and the insert portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. The blade <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is sharped at its top edge and forms a planar to surface <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> which defines the shape cut by the blade when the blade is pressed against a sheet or sheets of paper (not shown). While the base and insert portions <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, respectively, are preferably formed from plastic so that such components can be injection or otherwise molded, the blade <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is preferably formed from steel. When the blade <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is pinched between the base portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and the insert portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, the resilience and springiness of the steel blade <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> forms a biasing locking member between the insert and base portion making it difficult to disassemble the die cutting block <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> once assembled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> It may also be preferably to provide an interference fit between the base portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and the insert portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. This is accomplished by forming a male/female engagement between the lower portion of the insert portion and the bottom portion of the base portion. The male/female engagement is formed between the outer surface <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> of a wedge or inset portion <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> and the inner surface <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> of the ledge <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. In order to facilitate engagement between the outer surface <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and the inner surface <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, the inner surface <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is inwardly tapered from its top to its bottom. As such, as the inset portion <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> is forced into the inner surface <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, the engagement between the two surfaces <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> becomes tighter. This engagement helps keep the base portion and insert portion secured relative to one another once assembled. Of course, those of skill in the art will appreciate that this tapered feature to tighten engagement between the base portion and the insert portion may be accomplished also by inwardly tapering the surface <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> of the wedge portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Because the blade <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> also helps keep the insert and base portions <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> held tightly together, it is also contemplated that the insert portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> has a thickness that is the same as the distance from the top of the ledge <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> to the top surface <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. In such a case, the insert portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> would not extend past the top surface of the ledge <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</cross-reference> illustrate another preferred embodiment of the present invention of a die cutting block <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> of the present invention. The die cutting block <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> includes a base portion <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> having a top surface <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> and an inner wall surface <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> defining a recess <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>. The bottom <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> of the recess <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> forms an abutment <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> for supporting the bottom edge <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> of the blade <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>. The blade <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> is partially inserted within the recess <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> so that a portion <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> of the blade <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> extends above the top surface <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> of the base portion <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> An insert portion <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is inserted within the recess <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> of the base portion <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> such that the blade <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> is interposed between the inner wall surface <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> of the recess <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> and an outer surface <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> of the insert portion <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. The insert portion <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> provides an interference fit between the inner wall surface <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, the blade <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> and the outer surface <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> of the insert portion <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. It should be noted that without the blade <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>, the insert portion <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> fits loosely within the base portion such that there is a space between the base portion and the insert portion. When the blade <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> is formed to have a desired shape (an oval in this case), the blade will likely not exactly match the contour of the inner wall surface <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> or the outer surface <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> of the insert portion <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. Because the blade is preferably formed from steel rule which is inherently spring-like, the blade <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> will remain in a somewhat flexed state when inserted between the base portion <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and the insert portion <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. This flexed state has a biasing effect between the base portion <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and the insert portion <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> to tightly hold the base portion <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> relative to the insert portion <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. Thus, while the insert portion <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> forms a wedge within the recess to force the blade against the inner wall surface <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> of the base portion <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, the spring-like properties of the blade <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> are what hold the die cutting block <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> together once assembled without the need for adhesives or other types of mechanical fasteners. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> While the insert portion <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, blade <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>, and the recess <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> of the base portion <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> are illustrated as having similar shapes, the blade <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> is the only component that must hold its preformed shape so that it can cut an intended shape. Thus, so long as the insert portion <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and the base portion <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> can hold the blade in this shape, the insert portion <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and base portion <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> can take on various shapes and configurations. For example, the insert portion <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> could be configured to include various recesses and indentations about its perimeter while still providing an effective outer shape to hold the blade <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> within the recess <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>. Likewise, the inner wall surface <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> of the base portion <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> could provide various points of contact against the blade <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> to hold the blade in place but does not have to provide continuous contact about the blade&apos;s perimeter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> As further illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</cross-reference>, the blade <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> may be formed from a plurality of segments <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> that are welded together with welds <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight>. By welding the blade <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> into a singular component prior to assembly of the die cutting block <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, the assembly process is simplified compared to the assembly process of the prior art heretofore described. That is, there is no need to work with multiple blade segments that could become improperly inserted within the recess <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> or that could get overlapped or, more likely, leave gaps between segments. Any such gaps, would result in uncut portions when using the die cutting block <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> illustrates yet another preferred embodiment of a die cutting block <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> of the present invention. While the base portion <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> could be formed from a solid piece of material, in order to utilize less material for its formation, the base portion <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> of the device is formed from a top plate <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, and a bottom plate <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> interconnected by an inner wall <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>. The inner wall <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> and bottom plate <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> define a recess <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> within the base portion. An outer perimeter wall <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> extends around the top plate <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> and defines an inner space <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> between the outer perimeter wall <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> and the inner wall <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>. As with the other embodiments described herein, an insert <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> is inserted within the base <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> to hold a blade <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight>. The insert portion <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> only abuts against the bottom surface <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> of the recess <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> at various points since the insert <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> is provided with recesses <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> along its bottom surface <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight>. The insert portion <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> does, however, provide outer surfaces <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>428</bold></highlight> that impinge upon the blade <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> If it is necessary to remove the insert portion <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> to replace or realign the blade <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight>, as may be the case in the assembly process, at least one aperture or hole <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> is provided in the bottom plate <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> to provide access to the bottom surface <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight> of the insert <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> so that the insert <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> can be dislodged. To protect the user from the sharp edges of the blade <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> and to eject the material being cut from the inside of the blade, an ejection material is attached to the to surface or face of the die cutting block <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. The ejection material is preferably a foam rubber <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> having an open cell configuration and extends above the top edge of the blade <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> so that when the back of the block <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is pressed against a material, the foam rubber <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> is compressed to expose the cutting edge of the blade <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight>. When the block <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is removed from the material being cut, the ejection material <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> on the inside of the blade expands to eject any cut material and to recover the cutting edges of the blade <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, another embodiment of a die cutting block <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> in accordance with the present invention is illustrated. In this embodiment, the block <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is provided with a single base <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> housing a plurality of blades <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> and a plurality of inserts <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>. With such a configuration, a plurality of shapes can be cut from a single pressing of the block <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. Thus, it is contemplated in accordance with the present invention that a single die cutting block <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> can be configured provide for cutting of multiple shapes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A, 11B</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>B, a die cutting apparatus, in accordance with the principles of the present invention, may include multiple blades for forming interior cuts. The base <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</cross-reference> is configured similarly to that illustrated with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</cross-reference>. For simplicity of illustration, the die cutting apparatus of FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>B is configured to cut two concentric circles. It is contemplated, however, that such teachings may be applied to form die cutting apparatuses in accordance with the principles of the present invention to form other shapes in which interior cuts are desired. For example, die cutting apparatuses for cutting out letters could utilize such interior cuts to cut out center portions such as the center triangularly shaped portion of the letter A or the &ldquo;D&rdquo; shaped interior portions for such letters as B, D, P, and R. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The base <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> is comprised of a base member <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> defining a top surface <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> and a recess <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> formed therein. The recess <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> is configured to receive a first blade <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</cross-reference>), a first insert <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>, a second blade <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> and a second insert <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A and 13B</cross-reference>). The base member <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> is provided with a perimeter recess <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> on its underside <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight>. In order to provide a substantially continuous bottom surface <highlight><bold>624</bold></highlight> on the underside <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight>, a backside insert <highlight><bold>626</bold></highlight> configured to match the contour of the recess <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> is fitted within the recess <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> such that a bottom surface <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight> of the insert <highlight><bold>626</bold></highlight> is substantially flush with the bottom surface <highlight><bold>624</bold></highlight>. What has been referred herein as the underside <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight> with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</cross-reference> is actually to the top of the die cutting apparatus <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> in use. That is, the blades <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> will be placed face down against one or more sheets of material to be cut such that the surface <highlight><bold>624</bold></highlight> is facing up. As such, the cutting edges of the blades <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> lie in substantially the same plane so that the blades <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> substantially equally cut into the material being cut. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The first blade <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> is provided to make an outermost cut of the desired shape and is sized to substantially fit within the recess <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> such that the outside surface <highlight><bold>632</bold></highlight> of the blade <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> fits relatively snugly against the interior wall <highlight><bold>634</bold></highlight> of the recess <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight>. The height of the blade <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> is configured to extend above the top surface <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> while abutting against the bottom surface <highlight><bold>636</bold></highlight> of the recess <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight>. The optimal height of the blade is determined by the thickness and type of material used to form the blade so that the blade <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> can maintain structural integrity while being pressed against one or more sheet of material without bending. It is desirable, however, to provide a relatively thin blade that will maintain its cutting edge even after extended use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> As previously discussed, in order to provide an interior cut, an insert assembly, generally indicated at <highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight>, is provided. The insert assembly <highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight> is configured to fit within the blade <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight>. The insert assembly <highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight> is comprised of the first insert <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> and a second insert <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight> with a second blade <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> interposed between the first insert <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> and the second insert <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight>. The bottom perimeter edge <highlight><bold>615</bold></highlight> of the first insert <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> may be chamfered or rounded to facilitate insertion within the blade <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight>. In this particular embodiment, the second insert <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight> is seated within the first insert <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> with the first insert <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> defining an aperture <highlight><bold>642</bold></highlight> for receiving the second blade <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> and the second insert <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight>, but it should be appreciated that the configuration of the second blade and second insert may have any one of an endless number of configurations, including configurations that do not require the second insert to be fully encased by the first insert. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> illustrates yet another embodiment of a die cutting apparatus, generally indicated at <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>, in accordance with the principles of the present invention. The die cutting apparatus is comprised of a base portion <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> which defines a recess <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> therein for receiving an insert assembly, generally indicated at <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the insert assembly <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> is comprised of an outer blade <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> which defines the outer configuration of the shape to be cut by the die cutting apparatus <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>. An insert <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> is provided to hold the blade <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> by friction fit within a channel or slot defined between the outer wall <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> defining the recess <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> and the outside surface or wall <highlight><bold>714</bold></highlight> of the insert <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>. In order to provide additional interior features, such as perforated cuts, punches or crease rule to outline features in the shape being cut without making a complete cut through the die cut material, blades <highlight><bold>715</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>721</bold></highlight> are fitted within interior slots or channels <highlight><bold>722</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>727</bold></highlight>, respectively, that are formed in the insert <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>. The slots <highlight><bold>722</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>727</bold></highlight> allow for the blades <highlight><bold>716</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>721</bold></highlight> to be inserted therein and held in place relative to the insert <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>. These inner blades <highlight><bold>715</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>721</bold></highlight> may be provided with an irregular top cutting edge so as to form perforations in the material being cut or with a dulled edge so as to crease the paper without cutting through the paper. Thus, the blades <highlight><bold>715</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>721</bold></highlight> may provide perforated cuts in the material being cut to accentuate various features in the die cuts without completely cutting a continuous cut in the material. The perforation blades <highlight><bold>715</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>721</bold></highlight> may be formed from separate sections of blades or may be integrally formed into the outer blade <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>. For example, the blades <highlight><bold>718</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>721</bold></highlight> may be formed with the outer blade portion <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight> with parts of the blade providing perforating edges and part of the blade providing a continuous edge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> As further shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15, a</cross-reference> die cutting apparatus, generally indicated at <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> in accordance with the principles of the present invention, may include both a perforating interior cutting blade <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> and a non-perforating or continuous interior cutting blade <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight>. In this example, the base <highlight><bold>806</bold></highlight> provides an interior recess <highlight><bold>808</bold></highlight> that receives a first insert <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> and a second insert <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight>. The first and second inserts <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> are separated by a perforating blade <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight> that is held in place by the first and second inserts <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight>. The perforating blade <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight> extends from proximate a left side of the outer blade <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight> to proximate a right side of the outer blade <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight>. The first insert <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> is provided with an elongate slot <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight> that is interior to the first insert <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight>. The slot is configured to receive and hold the blade <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> therein. The slot <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight> preferably extends completely through the insert <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> but may only extend partially into the insert <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight>. The blades <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> are provided to provide interior detail to the shape being cut. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> While the blades forming the interior cuts described herein have been illustrated as being comprised of elongate, thin blade members, it is also contemplated that such blade members may be formed from punch type members such as those found on paper punches and the like. For example, if it is desired to cut eyes out of a sheet of material that is being die cut into the shape of a person or animal, elongate posts may be received within the insert holding one of the blades. The elongate posts may then be provided with sharpened edges for punching a hold in the material being cut. Furthermore, the posts may be held in place by providing a countersunk hole in the back of the insert with the post having a wider portion held in place by the countersunk portion of the hole in the insert. Once the insert is held in place by the base portion, such posts would be prevented from falling out of the insert. It should also be noted that the primary blade need not form a continuous, enclosed shape. The desired shape may be formed from a combination of continuous cuts and perforated cuts as my be desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> While the methods and apparatus of the present invention have been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments to illustrate what is believed to be the best mode of the invention, it is contemplated that upon review of the present invention, those of skill in the art will appreciate that various modifications and combinations may be made to the present embodiments without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as recited in the claims. The claims provided herein are intended to cover such modifications and combinations and all equivalents thereof. Reference herein to specific details of the illustrated embodiments is by way of example and not by way of limitation. </paragraph>
