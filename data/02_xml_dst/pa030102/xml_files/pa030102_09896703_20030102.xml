<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates in general to digital communications systems and more particularly to synchronization of digital information in a digital communications system. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Time and frequency synchronization is essential for reliable digital communications between the transmitting (Tx) and receiving (Rx) radios. As is known in the art, both transmitter and receiver should have the same nominal frequencies when communicating together. The receiver needs to &ldquo;tune&rdquo; within a certain tolerance to receive information exactly on the same frequency as the transmitter is transmitter in order to begin the demodulation process. This is commonly known as frequency synchronization and is required because the reference oscillators in the both radios (Tx and Rx) have different errors from the nominal frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Similarly, time synchronization of incoming digital information is also required since the receiver does not know the boundaries between incoming data symbols. Thus, symbol time synchronization refers to the boundary between successive symbols or digital data bits in order to successfully detect the symbols. This invention addresses the problem of acquiring synchronization (both time and frequency) by using a single 5 millisecond (mS) long synchronization word. The solution for fast acquisition enables the operation of a transmit interrupt feature that is one of the distinguishing features of the new Digital Interchange of Information &amp; Signaling (DIIS) standard that is intended to enable the transition from the analog technology in today&apos;s low tier Private Mobile Radio (PMR) systems. This type of system enables a higher speed (12 Kbps) digital communication supporting both speech and data. This is an evolution from an earlier European standard, Binary Interchange of Information and Signaling (BIIS) also known as ETS300.230.PMR protocol (DIIS). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The operation of a sync acquisition system depends on a known sequence of symbols that is periodically embedded in the transmit symbol bit stream. This sequence of symbols, already known to the receiver, is called the synchronization word. Any subsequent call related information is generally sent immediately after the sync word. In this way, any receiver when establishing initial communication starts looking for the sync word and call information to decide whether to participate in the communication or &ldquo;call&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The functional diagram of a typical receiver may be similar to the one shown in prior art <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. A common issue associated with this type of receiver is acquisition time. Acquisition time is the time it takes to sync transmitted data with received data i.e. the time during which the receiver cannot receive data since it is not yet in sync with the transmitted data. Digital in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) baseband (zero center frequency or low IF or very low IF) input signals <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are input to a coarse automatic frequency control (AFC) <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> for bringing the range of the radio frequency (RF) input signal within the range of a sharp digital channel select (CS) filter <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Although depicted here having a 3 dB bandwidth at 3 KHz for the DIIS modulation, such CS filter is chosen to select the desired signal while rejecting any off-channel power. Without the coarse AFC <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> however, the digital signal might be shifted out of the CS passband in view of the frequency. Typically for DIIS modulation it is required to bring the digital I-Q input signal <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> within 600 Hz of the center frequency of the CS filter <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> or too much signal is lost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The filtered signal is then passed to frame sync detector <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> which is a device looking for a sequence of digital symbols that is known to the receiver apriori. Thus anytime the receiver detects energy within the IF filter passband, it begins the process of detecting a known sequence of bits for frame symbolization. By using the fine symbol time estimator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, the receiver determines the boundary between symbols and also achieves frame synchronization (i.e. recognizes the known pattern of incoming bits of information). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Based on the time symbol estimation the receiver <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> will next do a fine frequency estimation to further reduce the frequency error between the transmitter and receiver frequencies. In order to properly decode data it is necessary to make this frequency error smaller than the tolerance of the symbol detection scheme. The tolerance could be as small as 10 Hz in case of coherent detection of DIIS signal or 100 Hz for non-coherent detection of DIIS signal. Since time synchronization has already been achieved, the fine frequency estimation works on known symbols using a fine frequency estimator <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Since the coarse AFC <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> can only tune the incoming I-Q baseband signal to within 600 Hz, the fine frequency estimator <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> works to fine tune the frequency of incoming data to approximately with 10 Hz in order to property detect the incoming data symbol. This correction is applied to mixer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> where it is mixed with the signal from the IF filter <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The output of the mixer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is then applied to the symbol detector <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> where it is then properly detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The prior art receiver synchronization system as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> has several weaknesses. The CS filter with a 3 dB bandwidth at 3 KHz is typically required for meeting an adjacent channel interference protection requirement. With this 3 dB bandwidth, a maximum offset of 600 Hz is acceptable at the input of the IF filter. According to related standards specifications, a mobile transmitter frequency is allowed to be up to 1.5 KHz away from its nominal value for a channel separation of 12.5 KHz. If the baseband I-Q signal is directly fed to the CS filter, in the worst case, with a difference of 3 KHz between Tx and Rx, a significant part of the desired signal gets attenuated by the CS filter. This accounts for the coarse AFC <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> placed before the CS filter <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The coarse AFC <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is supposed to bring the filter offset down form 3 KHZ to 600 Hz. The coarse AFC <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> however has to operate on unknown data symbols before the sync word, for the sync word to pass through the IF filter. This ultimately leads to a greater than acceptable delay and a period in which no synchronization occurs where the receiver is unable to receive information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the prior art system shows the frequency of incoming data information being within 3 KHz without any correction at time T<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The coarse AFC <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> narrowing the frequency offset within 600 Hz at time <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and the fine AFC <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> bringing the offset within 100 Hz at time T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> for non-coherent symbol detection. This results in a large receiver delay in being able to be on the correct frequency to detect incoming data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Therefore the needs exists to provide a digital receiver synchronization system that can easily and accurately provide both time and frequency synchronization to an incoming data stream with minimal delay to prevent any loss of incoming digital information.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the preferred embodiment of the fast frequency and time acquisition system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of the present invention includes an incoming digital baseband (zero center frequency or low IF or very low IF)in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) signal <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is input to a first wider channel select (CS) filter <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. The digital I-Q signal <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is filtered through the first wider CS filter <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> with a 3 dB bandwidth of 6 KHz. This is twice the filter bandwidth typically used in the prior art systems and acts to filter out extraneous signals outside of the 6 KHz passband. As will be recognized by those skilled in the art, although a 6 KHz filter is depicted here, any such suitable bandwidth will act as an equivalent for the first wide CS filter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The filtered signal from the first wide CS filter <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is directed to a frame sync detector <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. The frame sync detector <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> as noted herein works to recognize a predetermined series of bits in order to synchronize incoming digital information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Once frame sync is established by the frame sync detector <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, the received digital signal is directed to a series of devices to establish both time and frequency synchronization. Time synchronization is accomplished though the use of a coarse symbol time estimator <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. Due to the increased noise associated with the digital signal <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, the first symbol time estimator <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> can only make a coarse estimate of frequency synchronization. After the frame sync detection and a coarse symbol time estimation a fine frequency estimator <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> works to determine the receiver frequency to within the frequency error tolerance of the symbol detector. It should be noted that the frequency estimation <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is less sensitive than the symbol detector <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> to symbol time estimation error. Thus, the frequency estimator <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> can obtain a fine estimate even with a coarse symbol time estimate out of <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> It will further be recognized by those skilled in the art, that the frame synchronization detection symbol time estimation and frequency estimation all use the same part of the digital baseband I-Q signal <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> that corresponds to the synchronization word. Since, the frequency estimation is based on known sequence of digital symbols, it is relatively fast and accurate as compared to the coarse AFC as noted in the prior art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The frequency correction from the fine frequency estimator <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is then applied to the digital I-Q signal <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> using a digital mixer <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. This combined frequency corrected signal is then passed through a second CS filter <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> that is a narrower CS filter than the first wide CS filter. With the frequency correction applied, there is no danger of the second CS filter <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> attenuating an input signal with high offset. The filtered signal from the CS filter <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> is then used for symbol time estimation. This symbol time estimator <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> now provides a much finer and accurate frequency estimation since the narrower second CS filter <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> allows a much smaller amount of noise in the frequency estimation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> It will be evident to those skilled in the art that the first CS filter <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and the second CS filter <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> may be implemented in FIR filters to maintain linear phase response. The wider first CS filter <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> should be chosen to have a 3 dB bandwidth of 6 KHz which is an integral multiple of the narrower second CS filter <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. Such a choice allows the taps of the wider first CS filter <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> to be derived from the narrower second CS filter <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. Every other tap of the narrower second CS filter <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> might be chosen to be a tap of the wider first CS filter <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. Thus, the addition of a filter would not come at the cost of any increased memory requirement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> As seen in the timing diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, minimum acquisition time as compared with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, is generally reduced from time TO <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> to time T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>. In practice this savings can be from approximately greater than 30 milliseconds to as small as 5 milliseconds. The savings in minimum acquisition time comes from the fact that coarse AFC, as noted in the prior art, does not have to be run on unknown symbols. Therefore the overall minimal time acquisition and frequency acquisition time can be accomplished much more rapidly to reduce the amount of time when a digital signal may not be detected due lack of synchronization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates a flow chart of the receiver time and frequency acquisition algorithm <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> of the invention. According to the preferred method of the invention, the digital I-Q signal is passed though a relatively wide first IF filter <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> where it looks for frame synchronization. Once the frame sync is detected <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, a series of acquisition steps are accomplished <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. First, a coarse symbol time estimate is done followed by a fine frequency estimate. This frequency correction is applied to the I-Q digital signal. The frequency corrected signal is directed through a second CS filter that is narrower than the first wide CS filter. By filtering the digital signal further a more precise fine symbol time estimate can be accomplished. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> While the preferred embodiments of the invention have been illustrated and described, it will be clear that the invention is not so limited. Numerous modifications, changes, variations, substitutions and equivalents will occur to those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims.
