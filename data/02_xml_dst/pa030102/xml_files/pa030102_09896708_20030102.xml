<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an arrangement for mounting a restraint belt mounted vehicle seat to a vehicle floor and more particularly, to an arrangement for mounting a restraint belt mounted vehicle seat in an automotive vehicle that has an air bag system with multiple modes of inflation. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A typical automotive vehicle seat has a seat bun or cushion that supports the buttocks and upper thigh region of a seated occupant. Adjustably and pivotally connected to the seat cushion is a seat back. The seat back supports the back region of a seated occupant. The seat cushion is connected to a seat riser. To allow the seat to have fore and aft adjustment, a seat adjuster is provided. The seat adjuster includes a seat channel, also referred to as a seat rail. The seat rail is slidably mounted on a lower rail, often referred to as a floor rail. The floor rail is typically connected to the floor pan of the vehicle. Typically, the seat rail is interlocked along its length with the floor rail to prevent vertical separation. To ease the sliding movement between the seat rail and the floor rail, ball bearings or rollers spaced between the seat rail and floor rail are provided. The seat rail has a spring-biased locking mechanism that engages with a connected or integral rack provided on the floor rail to lock the relative fore and aft position between the seat rail and floor rail. Typically, the vehicle seat will have two parallel sets of floor rails and seat rails. A master floor rail and seat rail combination will have a master latch which manipulates a slave latch unit on a parallel spaced slave floor and seat rail assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In the most recent quarter-century, to facilitate vehicle safety, seatbelts have been added to vehicles. As a further enhancement of vehicle safety, three-point seatbelts have been provided which include shoulder restraints. Most front seatbelts have one end anchored to a B-pillar of the vehicle. The belt extends downward across the torso of a seated occupant through a loop. From the loop, the belt is routed across the seat occupant&apos;s lap and is then anchored to the vehicle floor. In a frontal crash, the load placed on the belt by a front seat occupant is mainly taken up by the B-pillar and/or the floor pan which the belt is anchored to. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In the most recent decade, a new type of anchoring system has been developed, commonly referred to as a belt-to-seat anchor restraint system. In the belt-to-seat anchor restraint system, one end of the belt is anchored to the B-pillar or to an upper region of the vehicle seat. The opposite extreme end of the belt is anchored to the upper portion of the seat riser which is fixably connected to the seat rail. The inner connection between the seat rail and the floor rail is strengthened to withstand the forces applied during a frontal crash situation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Many vehicles on the road today have airbags installed in steering wheels, dashboards, and more recently, doors. These airbags are designed to protect a vehicle occupant against both front and side impact collisions by rapidly inflating the airbag to absorb much of the collision energy that would otherwise be transferred to the occupant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Such conventional airbags are inflated based on a single threshold test: if a predetermined vehicle deceleration occurs in a collision, airbag inflation is triggered. Thereafter, airbag deployment occurs at a predetermined inflation rate. Both the triggering threshold and the inflation rate are typically not modified based on the type of vehicle collision, or the many different occupant variables, such as occupant weight, occupant position at the moment of impact, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> There has been a desire to modify air bag deployment based upon occupant weight and position. Typically, the larger the occupant, the greater the desired inflative force. For smaller occupants, a lowered inflative force response is desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> There are two major approaches to determine occupant weight on a vehicle seat. One approach is to have a pressure sensitive pad or bladder mounted somewhere within the seat cushion. Another approach is to place weight sensors between the floor pan and floor rail to sense the weight distribution on the vehicle seat and at a predetermined time sequence, inform the seatbelt inflater controller of the weight placed upon the vehicle seat. When using the weight sensor system, a new problem has occurred. The weight sensor typically adds a fixed link between the vehicle floor pan and the floor rail. Although this link is typically very strong in compression, there are limitations of this link in tension. Some vehicle occupant weight sensor systems rely upon a cantilevered support arrangement between the floor rail and floor pan of the vehicle. Cantilevered support arrangement weight sensors are typically very weak in tension. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It is desirable to provide a seat mounting system which allows for the utilization of a weight sensor element spaced between the floor rail of the vehicle seat and the floor pan of the vehicle, while at the same time allowing the vehicle to utilize a belt restraint seat anchoring system that anchors the restraint belt to the seat. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the present invention brings forth an arrangement for mounting a restraint belt mounted vehicle seat to a floor of an automotive vehicle. The arrangement includes a floor rail that supports the vehicle seat typically by a fore and aft seat adjuster that includes an interlocking seat rail. A load cell provides a supporting platform for the floor rail above the vehicle floor. Connected to the floor rail is a force transmittal member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the force transmittal member has an aperture. Inserted through the aperture is a headed fastener that is connected to the vehicle floor. Additionally, a lower riser is provided which is connected to the floor rail via the load cell. The lower riser is connected to and held in position on the vehicle floor by the aforementioned fastener. The head of the fastener restrains a capture member and connects the capture member to the vehicle floor. In a preferred embodiment the capture member has a generally U-shaped cross-section with extending flanges. The capture member is positioned adjacent the aperture in the force transmittal member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> During normal operation, the compressive load of the vehicle seat is transmitted from the floor rail via the load cell to the lower riser and then to the vehicle floor. Upon a frontal crash situation, the floor rail will displace in an upward vertical motion and cause the force transmittal member to come into an interference situation with the capture member and thereby be retained to the vehicle floor. The floor rail will not be dependent upon the tensile strength of the load cell to return the vehicle seat to its position. The vehicle seat designer is now free to provide a load cell arrangement which can give sensory data to an air bag deployment system, while at the same time allow the vehicle seat to have a belt-to-seat mounting arrangement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> It is a feature of the present invention to provide an arrangement for mounting a restraint belt mounted vehicle seat to a floor of an automotive vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> It is also a feature of the present invention to provide a method of retaining a vehicle seat to the floor of an automotive vehicle in a frontal crash situation wherein the vehicle seat utilizes load cells to sense the weight distribution upon the vehicle seat to inform a dual mode airbag inflation system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Other features of the invention will become more apparent to those skilled in the art upon a reading of the following detailed description and upon reference to the drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, an arrangement <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> for mounting a restraint belt mounted vehicle seat to a floor of an automotive vehicle is provided. The automotive vehicle has positioned therein a passenger seat <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The seat <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a seat cushion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Pivotally and operationally adjustably connected with respect to the seat cushion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is a seat back <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The seat cushion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is supported on two parallel spaced (only one shown) front seat risers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. A rear end of the seat cushion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is supported on a rear seat riser <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The rear seat riser <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> has a rear branch <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The rear branch <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> provides for the pivotal connection about axis <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the seat back <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The seat risers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> usually are hidden by a membrane cover or skirt <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>); however, for purposes of illustration they are exposed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The vehicle seat <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also has a belt restraint system which includes a restraint belt <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The restraint belt <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is commonly called a 3-point restraint system. An upper end <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the restraint belt is connected to a retractor (not shown) which is fixably connected to a B-pillar <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the vehicle. If the vehicle seat <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is utilized in the rear seat rather than as a front seat, the attachment of the retractor will be with a C-pillar rather than a B-pillar. In other embodiments (not shown) the retractor for the restraint belt <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may be physically connected to an upper end of the seat back <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The restraint belt <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> has an upper torso portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> which crosses over the chest and torso of a seated occupant. In some embodiments of restraint belt systems (not shown) the upper torso portion of the belt <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may be eyed through a loop connected to the outboard upper end of the seat back <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. A lower end of the upper torso portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the restraint belt is eyed through a loop (not shown) which is fixably connected to the vehicle seat <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. From the loop, the restraint belt has a lower lap portion <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> which restrains a seated occupant in his or her pelvic area. The lap belt <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> has on its extreme end a loop (not shown) which snaps into a seat belt buckle <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The seat belt buckle <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is fixably connected to a tension member <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The tension member <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is pivotally connected to the rear seat riser <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The pivotal connection of the tension member <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> with the rear seat riser <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is covered by a polymeric boot <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The seat risers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are fixably connected to a seat rail <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The seat rail <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is sometimes referred to as a seat channel, top rail or top channel. The seat rail <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is translationally mounted on rollers <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Additionally, the seat rail <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> has a latch adjustable fore and aft adjustment with a supporting floor rail <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The seat rail <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> has flanges (not shown) which have a vertical interlocking relationship with flanges (not shown) connected to the floor rail <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the seat rail <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> cannot be vertically displaced from the floor rail <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> without the causation of plastic deformation of both the seat rail <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and floor rail <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. A more detailed explanation of the interlocking relationship can be found by a review of U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,482,243; 4,832,409 and 4,787,756. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The floor rails <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> (only the outboard floor rail <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> being shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) which are parallel spaced from one another support the vehicle seat <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the weight of the seat occupant. The floor rails <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are fixably connected to a support member <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Underneath the support member <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is a front load cell <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and a rear load cell <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The load cells <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> provide a supporting platform for the floor rail <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> above the floor <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. The load cells <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> will be electrically connected with a controller (not shown) of an inflatable air bag restraint system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The load cells will inform the air bag controller not only of the respective weight placed upon the load cells <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> but will also give the air bag controller a concept of weight distribution. The information from the load cells can be used to determine if a large or small occupant is occupying the seat <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. If a low amount of weight is sensed by the load cells <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> the controller may be programmed to assume that an occupant of smaller stature is positioned within the seat and accordingly lower the inflation force of the air bag. In contrast, if the load cells <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> record a higher weight for the vehicle seat occupant, the load cells <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> will signal the controller for maximum inflation. The load cells <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are seated on a floor board depression bridge <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The bridge <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> spans a reinforcement depression <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> provided in the vehicle floor <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The support member <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is fixably connected to the floor rail <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> by fasteners (not shown). The support member <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> along its forward end has integrally connected thereto a force transmittal member <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. At a rear end the support member <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> has an integral force transmittal member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The force transmittal members <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> each have an enlarged aperture <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Inserted within the aperture <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is a fastener <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The fastener <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> has a head <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. The head <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> has a depression <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> for receipt of a drive socket (not shown). The fasteners <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> connect capture members <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to the vehicle floor <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. The capture members are generally U-shaped in their cross-section with a generally radially outward extending flange <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. The capture members <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> have a base <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. The base <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> has an aperture <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> which the fastener <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is inserted through. The base <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is engaged by the head <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of the fastener to connect the capture member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> with the vehicle floor <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The force transmittal members <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> each have an aperture <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> which encircles a side wall <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of the capture members and has a slight clearance therewith. Accordingly the apertures <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> are positioned under and adjacent the flanges <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the capture members. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In normal operating conditions, the force transmittal members <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> have a clearance with the capture members <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. In a predefined vehicle crash situation (typically a frontal crash) a vehicle seat occupant will load the restraint belt <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> which will cause an upward vertical force to be placed upon the rear seat riser <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The upward force on the rear seat riser <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> will cause the seat rail <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to pull up on the floor rail <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The interlocking arrangement between the seat rail <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the floor rail <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> (not shown) will cause the floor rail <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to pull up on the support member <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The resultant upward force of the floor rail <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> in many situations will cause it to either separate from the load cells <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> or cause the load cells <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to separate from the depression bridge <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The force transmittal members <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and especially <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> will be moved to an interference condition with the flanges <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the capture members <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The floor rails <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> will be retained to the floor <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> and separation of the vehicle seat <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from the vehicle floor <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> will be avoided in compliance with the seat retention requirements of the vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates an alternative preferred embodiment <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> for mounting a restraint belt mounted vehicle seat to a floor of an automotive vehicle. The mounting arrangement <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> has a multi-piece floor rail <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The floor rail <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> supports a set of rollers <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> which support a seat rail (not shown). The floor rail <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> has a front top plate <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. The floor rail <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> also has a rear top plate <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. The top plates <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> are joined to a bottom plate <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> by a series of rivets <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The bottom plate <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> has an expanded mound <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> which has an aperture <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. Captured within the mound <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is a head <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> of a fastener <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. The fastener <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> is positioned within an expanding sleeve <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Between the sleeve <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and a flat <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> of the mound <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is a cantilevered strain gauge portion <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> of a load cell. The strain gauge portion <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> has a strain notch <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. Opposite the strain gauge portion <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> is a cantilevered sensor box <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> which houses the appropriate electronics utilized by the load cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The strain gauge portion is also engaged by a head <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> of a fastener <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. The fastener <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> engages a sleeve <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. The sleeve <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> retains a lower riser <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> to the fastener <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The bottom plate <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is integrally formed with a front force transmittal member <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> and a rear force transmittal member <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>. A headed fastener <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> and a capture member <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> are provided in a manner similar to that for arrangement <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In normal operation the floor rail <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is cantilevered on the load cell strain gauge portion <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> above the vehicle floor <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> (not shown). In a predefined frontal crash situation it is anticipated that the strain gauge portion <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> will rupture or suffer highly significant plastic deformation in a region adjacent to the strain notch <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. However the force transmittal members <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> will again be restrained by the capture members <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> with like items being given identical reference numerals to those provided in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the headed fastener <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> additionally captures under its head <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> a washer <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>. The utilization of the washer <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> has been found to increase the strength of retention of the fastener <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> to the vehicle floor <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>.
