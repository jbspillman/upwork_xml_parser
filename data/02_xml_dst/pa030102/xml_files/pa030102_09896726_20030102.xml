<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to a handle for carrying cases, and more particularly to a pivotably adjustable handle for use with carrying cases. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Wheeled luggage cases have their wheels (usually two) mounted along the broad longitudinal edge at the bottom of the luggage case, and a handle used to steer the case on these wheels mounted on the upper end of the case. Usually this handle is mounted next to the broad edge at the top of the case and on the same broad side of the case as the wheels. In many instances, these cases attempt to adjust for a particular user&apos;s comfort. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> An example of this prior type of luggage case is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,943,936 assigned to Samsonite Corporation. In this patent, such a luggage case is shown with the disclosed luggage case has a wheel handle which extends out of and along one side of the case on an arm, and a handle grip mounted on this arm in a way that tips the luggage case forward to better balance over the wheels when carrying varying loads. The wheel handle arm also includes a mechanism that supports the handle grip at different heights mounted on a stalk or arm to avoid having a user to stoop. This arm can be extended to a convenient height for the user to wheel the case on the wheels by tipping the case forward onto the wheels. The arm can be lowered into a cavity or receiver mounted on one face or wall of the luggage case for convenient storage or shipping. In this instance, the handle is angled in a form that is desirable when the case carries other auxiliary cases by using the strap normally stored in the wheel handle. Although the handle is adjustable in height, the angle of the handle itself is not adjustable to optimize the comfort level of a particular user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In another wheeled luggage as shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,934,425 (&apos;425) assigned to Outrigger, Inc., the handle structure comprises a telescoping handle for pulling the luggage along the broad side of the luggage case as described above with the Samsonite luggage. &apos;425 further comprises a swing out handle that allows a user to carry the luggage along the narrow side of the luggage case. The swing out handle is not for use for pulling the luggage along the broadside and fails to pivot from the top of the telescoping handle to allow for adjustment when pulling the luggage along the broadside of the luggage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Thus, a need exists for a handle system or structure that comprises a handle pivotably coupled to the horizontal portion of an extendable handle that also selectively locks in at least one of a plurality of positions to provide an optimize angle for pulling (or pushing) luggage or cases. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In a first embodiment of the present invention, an adjustable handle system for a carrying case comprises an extendable and retractable vertical member having a horizontal portion therein on a top portion of the vertical member and a handle pivotably coupled to the horizontal portion, wherein the handle selectively pivots about the horizontal portion and selectively locks in at least one of a plurality of positions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In a second embodiment of the present invention, an adjustable handle system for a carrying case, comprises an extendable and retractable member having first and second vertical members and a horizontal member coupled between a top portion of the first and second vertical members and a handle pivotably coupled to the horizontal member, wherein the handle selectively pivots about the horizontal member and selectively locks in at least one of a plurality of positions. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> perspective view of a carrying case <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is shown comprising at least one wheel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on a bottom portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the carrying case <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the carry case <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises two wheels at opposing sides of a broad (back) bottom edge of the carrying case. The carry case <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also preferably comprises an adjustable handle system <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Also shown is the main housing having a back portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> or face, a front face <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and a zipper <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for providing access within the main housing of the carrying case. The adjustable handle system <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> preferably comprises an extendable and retractable vertical member <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> having a horizontal portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> therein on a top portion of said vertical member <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and a handle <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> pivotably coupled to the horizontal portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, wherein the handle <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> selectively pivots about the horizontal portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and selectively locks in at least one of a plurality of positions as will be illustrated in other Figures. Referring to the embodiment in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the extendable and retractable member preferably has first and second vertical members (<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>) and the horizontal portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is a horizontal member coupled between a top portion of the first and second vertical members (<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>). The first and second vertical members are preferably two telescoping members. The extendable and retractable member essentially forms a substantially &ldquo;U-shaped&rdquo; bar, although the present invention should not be limited to such shape as will be shown with respect to embodiments of FIGS. <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The handle <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> can also be constructed as a &ldquo;u-shaped&rdquo; member as shown in portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of handle <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Additionally, the handle <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may further comprise a grasping bar <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> attached to and extending from the U-shaped portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The handle <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is preferably smaller than the extendable and retractable member (<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>) and freely pivots within the confines of the extendable and retractable member. Thus, the extendable and retractable member <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the (pivoting) handle <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> both ideally fit within a storage area or cavity <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> in a retracted position when the handle is placed in a position parallel to the extendable and retractable member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Operationally, the adjustable handle system <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> will typically be in a retracted position as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and essentially be biased to remain in the retracted position until pulled up as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Both &ldquo;handles&rdquo; will ideally be lined in parallel and recessed within the cavity <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The cavity <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is preferably within a recessed area that has opposing recessed areas <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> as shown to allow for easy access to the &ldquo;handles&rdquo;. The cavity <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> may also include a rubber boot on the top periphery of the cavity that allows the handle to extend and retract, yet resists the intrusion of dust and possibly liquids. Once the handle is pulled up as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the vertical members <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> will remain in place at a set height under tension or by some other suitable position setting mechanism. The adjustable handle further preferably comprises a locking mechanism having a button on a portion of the handle allowing a user to selective lock the handle in any one of a plurality of positions. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, locking mechanism is a button <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> on the horizontal portion allowing a user to selective lock the handle <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in any one of a plurality of positions. Alternatively, the locking mechanism shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a button <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> on the a grasping bar <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> extending from the U-shaped portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Additionally, the grasping bar <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> can have a gripping area <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> ergonomically formed for most hands. In one embodiment, the user can selectively lock the handle in one of three positions as the handle <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> pivots about joint <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</cross-reference>, an alternative adjustable handle system <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is shown for a carrying case <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> (partially shown). The system <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> preferably comprises an extendable and retractable vertical member <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> having a horizontal portion <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> therein on a top portion of the vertical member. The system <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> further comprises a handle <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> pivotably coupled to the horizontal portion <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, wherein the handle selectively pivots about the horizontal portion and selectively locks in at least one of a plurality of positions. In this embodiment, instead of using two vertical members, one vertical member is used. Additionally, a recessed area <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> substantially in the shape of the handle <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is formed externally to the vertical member <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> to allow the handle <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> to be stored in the recessed area <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. This enables the vertical member <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and handle <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> to be stored within a cavity <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> in a retracted position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Similarly, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, another alternative adjustable handle system <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is shown for a carrying case <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> (partially shown). The system <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> preferably comprises an extendable and retractable vertical member <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> having a horizontal portion <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> therein on a top portion of the vertical member. The system <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> further comprises a handle <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> pivotably coupled to the horizontal portion <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>, wherein the handle selectively pivots about the horizontal portion and selectively locks in at least one of a plurality of positions. The handle in this embodiment is a similar to the handle <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the prior embodiment of FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. As in the previous embodiment, instead of using two vertical members, one vertical member is used. Additionally, a recessed area <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> substantially in the shape of the handle <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is formed externally to the vertical member <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to allow the handle <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> to be stored in the recessed area <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>. This enables the vertical member <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and handle <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> to be stored within a cavity <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> in a retracted position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> At an ideal angle, the carrying case will balance on the wheels with only minor vertical support provided at the handle by the user. So, the hand grip height (that distance from the floor to the handle grip when in the wheeling position) should be such that the case almost balances on the wheels while it is being towed, with the user providing a small amount of upward force during the pulling. This height can be finely adjusted using the pivoting handle <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> or handle <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> or handle <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. This would enable the ideal angle for towing the case such that it remains balanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Generally, one would like to have as long a wheel handle as reasonably possible. A long wheel handle, all other things being equal, provides the greatest leverage for supporting and balancing a luggage load. Also, a long arm helps distance the wheeled case from the user&apos;s feet so that the user may stride vigorously without hitting the towed case with the user&apos;s heels. The pivoting handle of the present invention further provides an extra extension in length to the usual single U-shaped handle that in many instances is constructed of two or more telescoping sections to reduce its stored height. </paragraph>
