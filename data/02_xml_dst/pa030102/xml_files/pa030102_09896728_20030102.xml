<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention pertains generally to methods and formulations for stopping or severely restricting a catalytic reaction between hydrogen and oxygen within enclosed spaces wherein the mixture of hydrogen and oxygen is within an explosive range. In particular, the invention pertains to a material formulation comprising a hydrogen getter and an inert low melting point agent which when heated will melt and wet the surface of the getter and thereby terminate the catalytic reaction before that reaction reaches the auto-ignition temperature of hydrogen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Hydrogen can be produced from corrosion of metals by atmospheric gases or electric currents; from batteries, and sealed electronic devices operating in normal or abnormal condition. In particular, the generation and accumulation of hydrogen in these devices can, and frequently does, become a safety hazard. For instance portable lighting devices such as sealed lanterns and flashlights which employ batteries having aqueous electrolytes, must provide a means for safely eliminating hydrogen generated as the result of electrochemical reactions, charging, excessive discharge, or inadvertent battery reversal, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Of particular concern, is the presence of both hydrogen and oxygen because of the potential for an explosion due to a static electric discharge or a spark in the presence of a noble metal hydrogenation catalyst. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, that the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst is rapid and exothermic and over a wide range of concentrations can be explosive because the catalyst temperature can rise from the heat of reaction above the ignition temperature of the mixture of hydrogen and oxygen gases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It has long been known that hydrogen scavenging materials, known as &ldquo;getters,&rdquo; can be used to counteract hydrogen accumulation. Ayers et al. (U.S. Pat. Ser. No. 4,512,721) discusses the use of active metals such as zirconium or titanium, and alloys thereof. These metals are capable of maintaining low hydrogen partial pressures but have the disadvantage of requiring high temperatures for initial activation and/or ongoing operation because of the necessity to diffuse surface contaminants into the bulk metal thereby providing a fresh surface for continued hydrogen absorption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is also well known in the art that unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds (i.e., double or triple bonds between carbon atoms) can be reduced by hydrogen and its isotopes in the presence of an appropriate catalyst to form an alkane; see, for example, Fieser, L. F. and Fieser, M., <highlight><italic>Textbook of Organic Chemistry, </italic></highlight>D. C. Heath &amp; Co. 1950, pp. 66-69 and 86. Additionally, Anderson et al., (U.S. Pat. Ser. Nos. 3,896,042 and 3,963,826) and Harrah et al., (U.S. Pat. Ser. No. 4,405,487) disclose the use of solid acetylenic compounds (i.e., organic compounds having carbon-carbon triple bonds) combined with various Group VIII metal catalysts to irreversibly remove hydrogen over the temperature range &minus;50&deg; C. to 110&deg; C. Shepodd et al. (U.S. Pat. Ser. Nos. 5,624,598, 5,703378, 5,837,158 and 6,063,307) disclose other compositions of unsaturated organic compounds and noble metal catalysts, particularly Pd, suitable for gettering hydrogen under a variety of conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Finally, Labaton, (U.S. Pat. Ser. No. 4,886,048), describes another means for removing hydrogen by reacting the hydrogen with oxygen in the presence of a noble metal catalyst, such as palladium, to form water and then trapping the water on a water absorbing material such as a molecular sieve, and Shepodd, et al. (U.S. Pat. Ser. No. 5,998,325), disclose hydrogen getter composition suitable for use in gaseous mixtures of hydrogen and oxygen within the explosive range, wherein the hydrogen and oxygen are catalyzed to form water vapor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Under most normal operating condition hydrogen getters of the type described by Shepodd, above (&apos;325), operate effectively and without need for emergency intervention. However, in order to protect a user in situations where the hydrogen getter becomes dangerously overheated there is a need for a means to safely removing hydrogen from an atmosphere which contains oxygen without the danger of explosion. The present invention provides a means for restricting the catalyzed reaction between hydrogen and oxygen from proceeding so rapidly as to accelerate out of control: to begin to &ldquo;run-away.&rdquo;</paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Certain consumer products such as sealed lanterns, flash lights, and the like, which rely on alkaline cells to provide power, can produce and retain hydrogen gas when the device is used and the electrical cells are discharged. Since these devices must also necessarily include an electrical switch, which may act as a spark source, these devices have been designed to incorporate a hydrogen getter pellet to safely remove the hydrogen gas. Unfortunately, such designs require making certain assumptions regarding the level of probably hydrogen generation which sometimes dictate increasing the concentration of these catalysts in order to increase the reaction rates of the hydrogen when the ambient concentrations of hydrogen are low. However, in certain circumstances there may exist a high probability that the getter pellet will be exposed to large quantities of hydrogen, such as during a cell short-circuit or reversal. In these cases such formulae can become increasing hot in the presence of higher concentrations of hydrogen and can thus present a &ldquo;run-away&rdquo; hazard; that is, a situation in which the catalysis reaction begins to accelerate uncontrollably causing the surface temperature of the getter to increase so quickly such that the system is unable to disperse the heat of reaction and leading to a potential for an ignition to occur . Such scenarios can and have lead to catalyst surface temperatures exceeding the auto-ignition temperature of hydrogen when a sufficient concentration of oxygen is also present. Such devices, therefore, are deemed to pose an imminent hazard if oxygen is also present in any significant quantity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Given that there is a desire on the part of a manufacturer to provide a product which can be safely operated under even the most extreme abuse, for those products or devices which incorporate a hydrogen getter to consume spurious hydrogen gas generated during device operation, it would be desirable to provide a means for moderating that reaction so as to prevent the getter from generating excessive amounts of heat and getting hot. This is especially desirable in instances where the atmosphere into which the hydrogen evolves also contains a significant fraction of oxygen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an object of this invention to provide a getter composition which includes a heat-activated sacrificial material intended to greatly slow getter above a chosen temperature. In particular, it is an object of this invention to provide a wax, or similar material, for compounding with a getter powder which would melt, wet, and coat the getter powder at a predetermined temperature and thereby greatly reduce the effective getter surface available for reaction.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The present invention discloses a composition and method for terminating, or substantially restricting, an uncontrolled catalytic reaction. The disclosed method and composition apply to a dispersed catalyst material at which an exothermic reaction would occur. The particular circumstance addressed the present invention is that of the uncontrolled reaction of hydrogen and oxygen at the surface of a catalytic getter material such as might occur due to accumulation of hydrogen in a small sealed volume where the explosive limit could be rapidly exceeded. In such circumstances the potential for personal injury due to fire and/or detonation of the gas mixture is significant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The present invention, therefore, is intended to terminate uncontrolled catalysis. However, while directed to limiting the uncontrolled reaction of hydrogen and oxygen, those skilled in the art will recognize that the method finds application wherever there exists the potential for an uncontrolled, heat-generating reaction taking place at the surface of a dispersed media. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Catalysts which will remove hydrogen from an environment are known and are known to operate along one of two routes: either through direct oxidation with O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>to form water vapor as described and disclosed in commonly owned U.S. Pat. Ser. No. 5,998,325, herein incorporated by reference, or through hydrogenating an unsaturated carbon-carbon bond as described and disclosed in commonly owned U.S. Pat. Ser. Nos. 5,624,598, 5,703,378, 5,837,158, and 6,063,307, herein incorporated by reference. In either case the catalysts comprises one or more of the metals listed in New IUPAC Groups 8-10 of the Periodic Table of Elements and rhenium, particularly platinum, palladium, and rhodium, and alloys of each. In the case where hydrogen is removed though hydrogenation the above catalyst formulations would further comprise an organic polymer having repeating monomer units having at least one carbon-carbon double or triple bond. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that hydrogen and oxygen can form explosive mixtures over a concentration range of about 6 vol % to about 70 vol % H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. A high temperature source such as a spark can initiate an explosive reaction of this gas mixture. Noble metal hydrogenation catalysts, especially when heated can also initiate ignition of a hydrogen/oxygen gas mixture within the explosive concentration range. Two reactions occur simultaneously during the course of hydrogenating the unsaturated bonds in an organic polymer in the presence of oxygen. One is the combination of hydrogen and oxygen in the presence of a catalyst to make water. The second is the hydrogenation of the carbon-carbon double bonds in the polymer. The generation of heat, with the consequential heating of surrounding materials, occurs when hydrogen and oxygen combine rapidly and exothermically in the presence of a catalyst and as a consequence of the hydrogenation of the unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds in a organic polymer molecule. If a means to control the reaction rate is not provided, such as that described in the present invention, detonation of the hydrogen/oxygen mixture can take place. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> This invention, therefore, provides a means for preventing an uncontrolled exothermic reaction by providing a material which if melted will coat the surface of a catalyst material and substantially prevent further catalysis by providing a permeation barrier and reducing available surface area. A composition comprising a wax compound blended with a the getter powder, is thus disclosed which achieves this result. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In particular, it is suggested that a loose hydrogen getter powder would be held together as a molded mass, a tablet for instance, by the binding action of a small quantity of a natural or synthetic wax. Since these waxes have the property of relatively low melting at temperatures, typically below 100&deg; C., and, more particularly between about 40&deg; C. and 85&deg; C., and because they also exhibit low viscosities above their melting points, these materials could function as a safety trigger to prevent or cut-off a run-away catalytic reaction. This would be provided as follows: a quantity of wax would be used to support and hold a hydrogenation catalyst powder on the surface of a generally compact mass somewhere within an confined space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> A suitable composition for removing hydrogen from a hydrogen/oxygen mixture, wherein the concentrations of hydrogen and oxygen can be within the explosive range, is between about 1-95 wt %, preferably between 1-30 wt %, of a hydrogenation catalyst as disclosed and described in commonly owned U.S. Pat. Ser. Nos. 5,624,598 and 5,837,158, preferably between 1-10 wt % Pd dispersed on an inert medium, such as carbon or alumina, barium carbonate consolidated into a wax tablet, within a restricted volume in order to ease assembly and placement and to conserve space within the intended device.) Under normal operating conditions the consolidated catalyst functions to remove hydrogen from the confined space and remains intact. Under uncontrolled conditions, however, the heat generated by the catalysis reaction causes surface temperature of the pellet to exceeds the melting point of the wax. As the wax melts it tends to coat the catalyst powder and thus moderates further catalytic reaction by reducing the surface area of the catalyst available to participate in the reaction. In addition, in order to continue the reaction process the reacting gases would necessarily need to penetrate the overlaying layer of wax. In any case catalysis is greatly reduced which in turn reduces the potential for localized accumulation heat and minimizing the potential for explosion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Careful review of the common natural and synthetic class of wax will also allow the designer to choose only those waxes which exhibit no discernable, or at least a very high, flash point (e.g. fl. pt.&gt;200&deg; C.). Of these the common vegetable waxes in this category there are bayberry, cofton, and sugar cane (no fl. pt.), hydrogenated castor oil (fl. pt.&gt;300&deg; C.), carnauba and ouricuri palm waxes (fl. pt.&gt;250&deg; C.); and candelilla and Japanese sumac (fl. pt.&gt;200&deg; C.); animal waxes such as Chinese insect, refined lanolin, and shellac (no fl. pt.), and beeswax and spermaceti (fl. pt.&gE;240&deg; C.); mineral waxes including ceresin, ozocerite, and moutan lignite (no fl. pt.); and synthetic waxes such as paraffin, polyethylene and polyethylene glycol (fl. pt.&gt;200&deg; C.). Each of these foregoing exhibits its own individual melting point ranging from about 40&deg; C. as in the case of lanolin and polyethylene glycol (PEG), to about 100&deg; C. in the case of polyethylene waxes. Most of the remaining substances, however, exhibit melting points which fall between about 60&deg; C. to 85&deg; C. The catalyst of the present invention therefore could be compounded to incorporate one or more of the above waxes to provide a body having any desired melting point across the recited range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> For example, the catalyst pellet would be prepared by dry blending about 1 gram of polymer hydrogen getter such as described in either of U.S. Pat. Ser. Nos. 5,624,598 or 5,837,158, with about 2 to 5 grams of ozocerite (for example) provided as loose granules (generally about 1 mm in diameter or about &plus;16 US Screen Mesh) thereby working the catalyst and wax together in order to incorporate the catalyst powder onto the surface of the wax granules. After blending in this manner the mixture is either compacted into a pellet or extruded as a rod and sliced into disks or rolled into sheets and cut or punched into any shape desired. The blended granules or extruded disks would be deployed in the container porous to the gas being gettered while the cut or punched sheets could be formed into articles designed to occupy a zone along an interior surface of the device needing protection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, a similar quantity of the Pd/C catalyst would be incorporated with 2 to 5 grams of shellac, provided as a dry powder similar in size to that of the catalyst powder. The dry powders would be blended as before, although in this case the aim is to provide a uniformly mixed aggregate rather than to simply coat the surface of the wax particles. Consolidation is performed by mechanical compaction under high pressure, into a dry pellet. Alternately, the blended shellac/catalyst powders may be dispersed and suspended into small quantity of a suitable carrier liquid to provide a &ldquo;paint&rdquo; which can be easily coated into interior surfaces. This approach only works, of course, provided that the wax granules are not soluble in the carrier media. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Finally, the utility and deployment of the present invention may better be appreciated by referring now to the schematic of the interior of a device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, such as a flashlight or lantern as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference>. These devices typically comprise a housing shell <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> which includes electrical conduction means such a strips <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of copper sheet running along a portion of the interior of shell <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Also included is switch <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> which itself includes knob <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> attached to bridging means <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for bridging each of the conducting strips <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>Included between the underside of knob <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and bridging means <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is pellet <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the formulation of the present invention. Alternatively the pellets <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> could be stored in a attached to the underside of knob <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, stored behind, for instance, the end one of cells <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (since these are usually forced together and against a terminal attached to the lantern or flashlight lamp, by means of a conducting spring), or in a separate chamber (not shown) placed along the inside wall of housing shell <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
