<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to circuitry for compensation of both pull-up and pull-down drivers using a single external precision resistive element and reduced interface pin count. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">2. GENERAL BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> For many years, impedance controlled drivers have been implemented on circuit boards. Especially for high-speed, input/output (I/O) product design, it is important that the impedance is generally fixed over variations in process, voltage and temperature. By maintaining a generally fixed impedance, a controlled driver can maintain good signal quality between devices on the circuit board and can maintain appropriate Direct Current (DC) voltage levels and alternating current (AC) timings margins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Commonly depending on p-channel metal-on-semiconductor (PMOS) devices, pull-up characteristics for impedance controlled drivers are independently compensated from pull-down characteristics of impedance controlled drivers, which commonly depend on n-channel metal-on-semiconductor (NMOS) devices. In many cases, for example, mechanisms are employed on a circuit board where a pull-up driver is compensated against a precision resistor terminated to ground (GND) and a corresponding pull-down driver is compensated against the pull-up driver. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> One disadvantage associated with this conventional impedance control mechanism is that it is quite inaccurate because the first driver gets compensated against a precision resistor while the second driver is compensated against a non-precision resistor. Granularity of the impedance controlled driver, on-die voltage supply variations or on-die transistor channel length and width variations can erroneously set the impedance of the second driver to an inaccurate value. Of course, this inaccuracy may be avoided if the interface uses two pins and two external precision resistors for compensating the pull-up and pull-down drivers separately. However, an extra interface pin would be necessary, and thus, adversely affects interface pin minimization. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a driver impedance control mechanism and method for compensating a driver circuit coupled to a terminated interface. More specifically, in one embodiment, the compensating driver circuit is an impedance-controlled driver coupled to a single resistive element held at an intermediate voltage level through a single interface pin and the same impedance control bits are sent to other drivers of the interface to keep good signal quality across the interface. The impedance-controlled driver can get compensated either as a pull-up driver or as a pull-down driver against external resistor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Herein, terminology is used to discuss certain features of the invention. For example, a &ldquo;platform&rdquo; may generally be considered as hardware equipment and/or software that process information. Some illustrative examples of a platform include a computer (e.g., desktop, a laptop, a hand-held, a server, a workstation, etc.), communication device (e.g., router, bridge, brouter, portable telephone, pager, etc.), a television set-top box and the like. A &ldquo;resistive element&rdquo; is generally considered herein as a resistor, potentiometer and the like. An &ldquo;interface pin&rdquo; is simply an input and/or output path, irregardless of its physical construction. A &ldquo;link&rdquo; is broadly defined as one or more information-carrying mediums to establish a communication pathway, including physical medium (e.g., electrical wire, optical fiber, cable, bus traces, etc.) or wireless medium (e.g., air in combination with wireless signaling technology). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. However, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that these specific details are not required in order to practice an embodiment of the invention. In other instances, well-known electrical structures and circuits are shown in block diagram form in order not to obscure the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an exemplary diagram illustrating a platform <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in which one embodiment of the invention can be practiced is shown. The platform <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a circuit board <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> that supports one or more of the following devices: a processor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, a memory controller hub (MCH) <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, a platform memory <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and a voltage regulator <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. The voltage regulator <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> supplies power to devices on the circuit board <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> including a driver supply voltage (V<highlight><subscript>dd</subscript></highlight>) to the MCH <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The processor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is generally considered as any hardware and/or software that performs operations on incoming data. For example, in this embodiment, the processor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> represents a central processing unit of any type of architecture, such as complex instruction set computers (CISC), reduced instruction set computers (RISC), very long instruction word (VLIW), or hybrid architecture. The processor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be compatible with an Intel Architecture (IA) processor such as the PENTIUM&trade; series, IA-32&trade; or an IA-64&trade; processor. It is contemplated, however, that other embodiments for the processor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may include a controller, a digital signal processor (DSP), a state machine and the like. Moreover, one or more processors <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be utilized as represented by dashed lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The processor(s) <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is coupled to a host bus <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, which provides interface signals to allow the processor(s) <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to communicate with other processors or devices. One of these devices may include the MCH <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, which is integrated into a chipset. The MCH <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> provides control and configuration of memory and I/O devices such as the platform memory <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> that stores code and data. In this embodiment, the MCH <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> includes an integrated circuit featuring an impedance controlled driver coupled to both the voltage regulator <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> for receipt of the supply driver voltage (V<highlight><subscript>dd</subscript></highlight>) and a resistive element on the circuit board <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, an exemplary embodiment of a driver impedance control mechanism <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> implemented on an integrated circuit <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is shown. The driver impedance control mechanism <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> undergoes first, a pull-up compensation adjustment scheme to adjust the strength of the impedance-controlled driver operating as a pull-up driver. Later, the driver impedance control mechanism <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> undergoes a pull-down compensation adjustment scheme to adjust the strength of the impedance-controlled driver operating as a pull-down driver. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> For illustrative purposes, the integrated circuit <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> may be implemented as part of the MCH <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, although the invention does not require such implementation. If implemented with an integrated circuit package <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, the integrated circuit <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> may experience small, additional impedance over a link <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. The link <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> is coupled between a resistance compensation pad <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> of the integrated circuit <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and terminated by a resistive element <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> on the circuit board <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. One end <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight> of the resistive element <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is coupled to the link <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> while the other end <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> is coupled to the voltage regulator <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> for receipt of an intermediate voltage (V<highlight><subscript>tt</subscript></highlight>), which may be approximately one-half the supply driver voltage (V<highlight><subscript>dd</subscript></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Herein, the driver impedance control mechanism <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> comprises a control interface <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, combinatorial logic <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, a pre-driver circuit <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, an impedance controlled driver <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, a bump resistive element <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>, a sense link <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> coupled to the resistance compensation pad <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, a plurality of differential amplifier elements <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight>. The output of the differential amplifier elements <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> is provided to a state machine <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight>. The state machine <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> provides one or more feedback signals over link <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> to the pre-driver circuit <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> in efforts to further control impedance adjustment for the impedance controlled driver <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> or to maintain its current impedance value. These feedback signals are impedance control bits, which are used to set the pre-driver circuit <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> as well as other drivers of an interface (e.g., an interface for the MCH <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) to maintain good signal quality across that interface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> As shown, the control interface <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> includes at least one data link <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> and an enable link <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. The enable link <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, when placed in an active state, places the driver impedance control mechanism <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> into an operational state. In particular, when the enable link <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is active, the combinatorial logic <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> provides an input signal <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> to the pre-driver circuit <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> that indicates whether the impedance-controlled driver <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> is to operate as a pull-up driver or a pull-down driver. For one embodiment, if the data link <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> is inactive (e.g., placed in a logical LOW state), the impedance-controlled driver <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> is to operate as a pull-down driver. If the data link <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> is active (e.g., placed in a logical HIGH state), the impedance controlled driver <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> is to operate as a pull-up driver. Thus, the type of driver is dependent on the state of the data link <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. However, when the enable line <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is placed in an inactive state, the input signal <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> is tri-stated so that the driver impedance control mechanism <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is non-operational. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The pre-driver circuit <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> receives the input signal <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> to indicate when the driver impedance control mechanism is operational and receives feedback signal(s) over link <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight>. In response, the pre-driver circuit <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> outputs a control signal CTL&lsqb;N-1:0&rsqb; <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> that selects the amount of impedance driven by impedance controlled driver <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. For one embodiment, although not shown, the amount of impedance may be separated into N transistor groupings selected by the pre-driver circuit <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. Each grouping may have up to 2<highlight><superscript>N-1 </superscript></highlight>transistors in which the lesser number of transistors results in a smaller affect on impedance. For instance, one grouping may have one transistor (e.g., a P-channel transistor), a second grouping may have two transistors, and a third grouping may have four transistors resulting in bigger impact on impedance than the first two groupings. Thus, for one embodiment, the pre-driver circuit <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> may select one or more of these grouping for adjustment of the impedance value for the impedance controlled driver. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The impedance-controlled driver <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> may drive a voltage sensed at the resistance compensation pad <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> via link <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> and the sensed voltage is compared against two threshold voltages by the plurality of differential amplifier elements <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight>. These threshold voltages include a threshold voltage for pull-up compensation (V<highlight><subscript>OH</subscript></highlight>) and a threshold voltage for pull-down compensation (V<highlight><subscript>OL</subscript></highlight>). These voltages V<highlight><subscript>OH </subscript></highlight>and V<highlight><subscript>OL </subscript></highlight>are determined by the target impedance required for the impedance controlled driver <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> to operate at a particular level of pull-up driver and a pull-down driver, respectively. While voltages V<highlight><subscript>OH </subscript></highlight>and V<highlight><subscript>OL </subscript></highlight>are provided from an outside source for better accuracy and control, it is contemplated that these voltages can be provided on-chip through a resistive network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> During a pull-up compensation adjustment scheme, the state machine <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> starts with very strong pull-up strength (e.g., small pull-up impedance), in the event that the sensed voltage is greater than V<highlight><subscript>OH</subscript></highlight>, normally greater than V<highlight><subscript>tt</subscript></highlight>, a first differential amplifier element <highlight><bold>361</bold></highlight> outputs an active INCREMENTVOH signal over link <highlight><bold>363</bold></highlight> to the state machine <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight>. The active INCREMENTVOH signal notifies the state machine <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> to increase the impedance driven by the impedance controlled driver <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. In response, the state machine <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> outputs the feedback signal(s). In one embodiment, the feedback signal(s) turn off various transistors for increasing the impedance being driven. Once the sensed voltage is determined to be approximately equal to V<highlight><subscript>OH</subscript></highlight>, the first differential amplifier element <highlight><bold>361</bold></highlight> deactivates the INCREMENTVOH signal to indicate to the state machine <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> that the targeted pull-up driver strength has been met. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Besides performance of a pull-up compensation adjustment scheme, the driver impedance control mechanism <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> further performs the pull-down compensation adjustment scheme by initially providing the lowest impedance for pull-down. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In the event that the sensed voltage at the resistance compensation pad <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is less than V<highlight><subscript>OL</subscript></highlight>, normally less than V<highlight><subscript>tt</subscript></highlight>, a second differential amplifier element <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> outputs an active INCREMENTVOL signal over link <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> to the state machine <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight>. The active INCREMENTVOL signal notifies the state machine <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> to increase the impedance driven by the impedance controlled driver <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. In response, the state machine <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> outputs the feedback signal(s) over link <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the feedback signal(s) <highlight><bold>381</bold></highlight> turns off various transistors for increasing the impedance being driven. Once the sensed voltage is determined to be approximately equal to V<highlight><subscript>OL</subscript></highlight>, the second differential amplifier element <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> deactivates the INCREMENTVOL signal to indicate to the state machine <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> that the targeted pull-down driver strength has been met. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> As a result, compensation for both pull-up and pull-down drivers can be accomplished with a single resistive element <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> and a single interface pin by terminating the resistance compensation pad to an intermediate voltage (V<highlight><subscript>tt</subscript></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, an exemplary embodiment of a timing diagram of signals utilized by the driver impedance control mechanism of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is shown. Initially, upon activation of the enable link <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and the data link <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, which signals a pull-up compensation adjustment scheme for this embodiment, compensation is performed so that the voltage driven on the resistance compensation pad is substantially higher than V<highlight><subscript>OH </subscript></highlight>(see labels <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>). As a result, the INCREMENTVOH signal is activated to cause an increase in impedance and reduction of pull-up drive strength until the voltage driven on the resistance compensation pad is approximately equal to V<highlight><subscript>OH </subscript></highlight>(labels <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>). Thereafter, the INCREMENTVOH signal is deactivated to set the targeted pull-up impedance (label <highlight><bold>425</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Upon deactivation of the data link <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, which signals a pull-down compensation adjustment scheme for this embodiment, compensation is performed so that the voltage driven on the resistance compensation pad is substantially lower than V<highlight><subscript>OL </subscript></highlight>(see labels <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>435</bold></highlight>). As a result, the INCREMENTVOL signal is activated to cause an increase in impedance and reduction of pull-down drive strength until the voltage driven on the resistance compensation pad is approximately equal to V<highlight><subscript>OL </subscript></highlight>(labels <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>445</bold></highlight>). Thereafter, the INCREMENTVOL signal is deactivated to set the targeted pull-down impedance (label <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight>). Also, the enable link <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is deactivated to denote completion of the compensation adjustments (label <highlight><bold>455</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
