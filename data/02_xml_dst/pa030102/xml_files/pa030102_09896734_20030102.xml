<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A system and method is disclosed for writing early within a memory cycle by injecting a small voltage difference signal prior to setting a sense amplifier, and thereafter setting the sense amplifier which amplifies the small voltage signal to predetermined high and low voltage logic levels for writing to the memory cell. In this way, writing can complete in about the same time as reading, without risking corruption of data on adjacent bitlines in the memory. Local bitswitches apply first and second write voltages having a small voltage difference to a true bitline and a reference bitline prior to setting the sense amplifier. Local bitswitches on such other memory cells not currently being written are adapted to isolate true and reference bitlines coupled to those memory cells prior to the setting of sense amplifiers coupled to those bitlines, such that the stored contents of such memory cells not being written are refreshed at the time that the selected memory cell is written. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to integrated circuit memories and more specifically to an integrated circuit memory, especially a dynamic random access memory (DRAM), in which stored contents are sensed from small voltage signals present on bitlines. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Existing DRAMs are generally slower to access than static random access memory (SRAM) or read only memory (ROM). Conventionally, DRAMs have been manufactured as standalone independent integrated circuit chips which store large quantities of data for faster access than magnetic or optical disk media, at relatively low prices and low power consumption. SRAMs and ROMs, by contrast, have usually provided faster access than DRAMs, but often at higher prices and power consumption because these memory types require a larger device count per stored data bit, which adds to cost and density. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Recently, interest has increased in using DRAMs as one of several elements of an integrated circuit, e.g. a &ldquo;system on a chip&rdquo;, which may also include logic or linear circuits or other circuit types. Such DRAM elements have been called embedded DRAM or &ldquo;EDRAM&rdquo;. The goals of using embedded DRAM include obtaining potentially large amounts of easily rewriteable storage with fast access times but at lower cost and power consumption than SRAMs. One problem facing existing DRAMs is that it takes longer to write a memory cell with a new datum than it takes to read or refresh the datum in that memory cell. This problem is understood with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. Specifically, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows signals which are active when a prior art DRAM memory cell is being read. A read operation begins with the wordline voltage <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> rising from a quiescent value (in this case, about &minus;0.4 volts) to an activated value which makes the access transistor of the memory cell conduct. Charge stored by a capacitor in the memory cell then begins to flow through the transistor on a bitline to a sense amplifier. At the sense amplifier a small voltage difference signal <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> develops between the voltage <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on a bitline BT and the voltage <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> on a reference bitline BC which is not connected to the memory cell being read. The sense amplifier functions to convert a small swing, e.g. &ldquo;analog&rdquo; signal between the bitline BT and the reference bitline BC into a full swing logic level signal for storage to or transfer of the datum from the memory cell. After the small voltage signal <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> appears, the sense amplifier is set, i.e. triggered through a signal SETP <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, to amplify the small voltage signal <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to full swing logic levels. This results in the bitline voltage <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the reference bitline voltage <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> separating from their initial small voltage difference to respective predetermined high and predetermined low logic levels, in this case about 1.2 V, and 0.0 V, respectively. The voltage stored in the memory cell is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> by curve <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> By contrast, some write operations in conventional DRAMs take longer to perform than a read operation. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, an operation to write a high logic level, i.e. a &ldquo;1&rdquo; in a memory cell that currently stores a low logic level, i.e. a &ldquo;0&rdquo; is known as &ldquo;Read<highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight>0_Modify_Write<highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight>1.&rdquo; This write operation starts by reading the memory cell which contains a &ldquo;0&rdquo; and then forcing the memory cell to store the opposite value &ldquo;1.&rdquo; The initial reading step is necessary to prevent the stored contents of memory cells on adjacent bitlines from becoming corrupted. While the one memory cell is being rewritten with a &ldquo;1&rdquo; from a &ldquo;0&rdquo; state, memory cells on other bitlines accessed by the same wordline are read and &ldquo;written back&rdquo; with the same data that they already store. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the read_modify_write operation begins the same way as the read operation with the wordline voltage <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> rising from the quiescent value to an activated value. Charge stored by a capacitor in the memory cell then begins to flow through the transistor on a bitline to a sense amplifier, where a small voltage difference signal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> develops between the voltage <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> on a bitline BT and the voltage <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> on a reference bitline BC which is not connected to the memory cell being written. After the small voltage signal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> appears, the signal SETP <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> sets the sense amplifier, which results in the small voltage signal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> being amplified into predetermined high and predetermined low logic levels on the reference bitline BC and the bitline BT, respectively, which reflect the original &ldquo;0&rdquo; value datum stored in the memory cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In the prior art DRAM operation shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the voltages <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> on the bitline BT and reference bitline BC are forced to new levels only after the sense amplifier is set. After the sense amplifier is set, the voltages <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> advance almost fully towards the high and low logic levels, respectively. Then, the bitline and reference bitline voltages reverse course to reach the opposite levels as required by the write operation. The time required to perform the initial read before writing makes the voltage <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in the memory cell take longer to rise than in the read operation. In comparison to the read operation shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, in the read_modify_write operation, the memory cell voltage takes about 30% longer to rise to 90% of final value than it does in the read operation, as evident from comparing the intervals t<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>-t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> with t<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>&prime;-t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Heretofore, the longer time to perform the read_modify_write operation has been considered acceptable. This is because forcing bitline signal levels to new values too soon could potentially corrupt data in other memory cells due to line to line noise coupling between the bitline being written and an adjacent bitline. Heretofore, there has not been a way to quickly write a memory cell with a new value without risking corruption of data in memory cells which are accessed by adjacent bitlines. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, among objects of the invention, each of which may operate in the alternative to, or in conjunction with other objects, are the following: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> An object of the invention is to perform a write operation to a memory cell in about as little time as a read operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Another object of the invention is to quickly perform a write operation to a memory cell without risking corruption of data in memory cells accessed by adjacent bitlines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Still another object of the invention is to perform a write operation by injecting a small voltage signal onto a bitline and a reference bitline and setting a sense amplifier to amplify the signal into predetermined high and low logic levels for storing into a memory cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, in an aspect of the present invention, an integrated circuit including a memory is provided which is adapted to write a datum to a memory cell by local bitswitches which apply first and second write voltages having a small voltage difference to a true bitline and a reference bitline prior to a sense amplifier being set, the sense amplifier being adapted to amplify the small voltage difference to a predetermined high voltage and a predetermined low voltage, the true bitline having one of the predetermined high voltage and the predetermined low voltage, which is then written to the memory cell. </paragraph>

Local bitswitches on such other memory cells not currently being written are adapted to isolate true and reference bitlines coupled to those memory cells prior to the setting of sense amplifiers coupled to those bitlines, such that the stored contents of such memory cells not being written are refreshed at the time that the selected memory cell is written. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a system and method of writing a datum to a memory cell by applying a small voltage difference write signal to a true bitline and a reference bitline, i.e. complementary bitline, at a time prior to setting a sense amplifier, and then setting the sense amplifier to amplify the small voltage difference on the true and reference bitlines to a full swing signal being a predetermined high voltage on one of the true and reference bitlines and a predetermined low voltage on the other one. The memory cell is then written with the high voltage or the low voltage which is present on the true bitline. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> By contrast, the reading of a memory cell is performed by activating a wordline and permitting a small voltage difference signal to develop on the true and reference bitlines from the charge stored within the memory cell, and then setting the sense amplifier to amplify the small voltage difference signal to a full swing signal being a predetermined high voltage on one of the true and reference bitlines and a predetermined low voltage on the other one. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment described below, a small voltage difference write signal is applied to the true and reference bitlines using bitswitches which are timed differently for write operations as they are for read operations. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a block diagram of sensing circuitry associated with a memory array. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, local bitswitches within each group <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, preferably implemented as NFETs, control the signal flow on the true and reference bitlines between a primary sense amplifier group <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and a local buffer <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Each local buffer <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> has one true fan node and one complement fan node which are coupled by eight pairs of local bitswitches to one of eight true bitlines and to one of eight reference bitlines in the group <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of eight sense amplifiers, respectively. In each group of eight pairs of local bitswitches, one pair is turned on at a time by signals LBXP&lt;0:7&gt; to conduct signals between the true bitline and true fan node, and between the reference bitline and complement fan node. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, in a write operation, prior to setting the sense amplifier, a small voltage difference signal having a desired polarity is applied to the true and complement fan nodes and the local bitswitch pair is turned on. This results in a small voltage difference signal being applied to the true and reference bitlines. The sense amplifier is then set, which amplifies that small voltage difference signal into predetermined high and predetermined low voltage logic levels, a different one of these levels to each of the true and reference bitlines. The high voltage level or the low voltage level which is present on the true bitline stores a datum to the memory cell, and the local bitswitch pair is then turned off again. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a schematic diagram of a local buffer <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> including true fan node FC and complement fan node FT. Local buffer <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> applies a small voltage difference write signal to the true and complement fan nodes FC and FT, the polarity of the signal determined by whether a &ldquo;0&rdquo; or a &ldquo;1&rdquo; is to be written to the memory cell. The logic circuitry of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, which will be more fully explained below, controls bitswitch timing such that the local bitswitch pair is turned on and off with different timing for read and write operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The local buffer <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> provides for read data output at terminal PDOT, and for write data input at terminal PDIT. A global read signal LBREADP and associated circuitry manages signal output through PDOT. A global write signal LBWRITEP, active only during a write operation, causes a small voltage difference write signal to be applied to true and complement fan nodes FT and FC. Signals PDIT and LBWRITEP are input to logic circuits which apply a small voltage VWRITE to one of true fan node FT and complement fan node FC, as controlled by the binary value of PDIT, while the other one of true fan node FT and complement fan node FC is discharged to ground. VWRITE is a small voltage signal in relation to the high and low voltages that are used as full swing logic levels to output a datum read from the true and reference bitlines. The voltage VWRITE, referenced to ground, is comparatively close to the small voltage difference signal between true and reference bitlines which are input to a sense amplifier within group <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> from a memory cell, which the sense amplifier amplifies to full swing logic levels for readout. In an exemplary system in which full swing logic levels of 0.0 V and 1.2 V are used on true and reference bitlines, a small voltage difference signal is applied to true and reference bitlines by applying a VWRITE voltage of about 250 mV to one of them, and ground to the other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows an exemplary circuit used to generate and maintain a small voltage supply VWRITE. The circuit includes two voltage dividers <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. Voltage divider <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is a low impedance divider which conducts only during a write operation, as controlled by the READ signal input through an inverter and associated switching logic. The low impedance divider <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> sources current during write operations. Voltage divider <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> has high impedance and is used to maintain the VWRITE voltage level in other than write operations. A capacitor <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> further assists in maintaining the voltage level and sourcing current when needed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, local buffer <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> receives global sense amplifier set signals for an upper array (UPSETP), and for a lower array (LPSETP), which are regenerated as local set sense amplifier signals USETP and LSETP, respectively. These local set sense amplifier signals are reset by global equalization signals UPSETEQP and LESETEQP, respectively. As evident in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the activation of either local set sense amplifier signal USETP or LSETP turns off a transistor <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, thus preventing the voltage VWRITE from being applied to either true fan node FT or its complement FC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Write precharge devices <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> are provided and controlled separately from read precharge devices <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. For a write operation, fan nodes FT and FC are &ldquo;precharged,&rdquo; i.e. discharged to ground, by devices <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> as timed by write precharge signal WRPREC. On the other hand, for a read operation, fan nodes FT and FC are precharged to a predetermined high voltage logic level Vdd by devices <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, as timed by read precharge signal LBRESTN. PFET devices <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, cross-coupled between fan nodes FC and FT, are activated by a signal SREADP only during a read operation. During the read operation, the cross-coupled devices <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> assist in regenerating and maintaining each of the predetermined high and low logic levels on the true and complement fan nodes FT and FC. The devices <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> are disabled during a write operation, since signal differentiation is desired to be performed only in primary sense amplifier of local group <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> An exemplary circuit for generating global bitswitch on/off signals is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. This circuit times the activation of the global bitswitch signal differently for read and write operations. Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the global bitswitch on/off signals BXP&lt;0:7&gt; are transferred to the local bitswitches as local bitswitch signals LBXP&lt;0:7&gt;, generated by logic circuitry shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. As noted above, in a read operation, a local bitswitch pair is turned on when the sense amplifier is set and is turned off when the wordline is deactivated. By contrast, during a write operation, the local bitswitch pair is turned on earlier, at the time the wordline is activated, and is turned off again when the sense amplifier is set, long before the wordline is deactivated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, one of eight global bitswitches BXP0.7 is selected by binary inputs to decoder gate A which goes high upon receiving the correct input combination. During a write operation, the selected global bitswitch goes high when the wordline is activated and goes low again when the sense amplifier is set. Throughout the write operation, the READ signal remains low causing gate D output to remain high. When the wordline is activated (as represented by the input &ldquo;Dummy Wordline Decode&rdquo; going high) and prior to the sense amplifier being set, both inputs to gate B are high, which force gate B output to low, gate C output to low in turn, and the outputs of gate E high and BXP high. The global bitswitch is then on. When the sense amplifer set signal is received, the output of gate B goes high, gate C goes high in turn, and the outputs of gate E and BXP go low again. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> During a read operation, a selected global bitswitch goes high when the sense amplifier is set and goes low again when the sense amplifier is reset. In this operation, the READ signal is high. After the wordline is activated (as represented by &ldquo;Dummy Wordline Decode&rdquo; and prior to the sense amplifier being set, both inputs to gate B are high, and gate B goes low. Gate C goes high because READ is high and gate D is high because sense amplifier set is still low. Therefore, gate E is low and BXP is low in turn. After the sense amplifier set signal is received, gate B goes high, gate C stays high because READ is high, but gate D goes low because sense amplifier set is high. Thus, gate E goes high, which in turn drives global bitswitch signal BXP high. BXP falls low again when sense amplifier set falls low, driving gate D high and gate E low. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows logic circuitry which transfers global bitswitch signals to local bitswitches according to whether a particular block, i.e. sense amplifier group <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, is selected with a block write signal BW. As indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, block write signals BW<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> . . . BW<highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> are provided to respective ones of the groups <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. For example, a local bitswitch pair for the pair of true and reference bitlines numbered &ldquo;1&rdquo; in a group <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is turned on by local bitswitch signal LBXP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> when an enabled block write signal BW and enabled global bitswitch signal BXP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are present. During read operations, all block write signals BW remain enabled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In operation, a write operation is performed in about the same amount of time as a read operation, without disturbing data stored in memory cells accessed by bitlines adjacent to the bitline where the write is performed. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> write operation begins with the following initial conditions: LSETP, USETP, SREADP, LBREADP all low, LBRESTN high. To prepare to write, the signal WRPREC causes devices <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> to discharge the true and complement fan nodes FT and FC to ground. Following precharge, write input PDIT and write control signal LBWRITEP are presented to local buffer <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Based on whether PDIT is high or low, VWRITE is applied from low impedance divider <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) to one of the true and complement fan nodes FT and FC, while the other fan node is held at ground. For example, if PDIT is high, true fan node FT will be charged to the VWRITE voltage and complement fan node FC will be held at ground. Alternatively, if PDIT is low, complement fan node FC will be charged to VWRITE and true fan node FT will be held at ground. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In the meantime, a global bitswitch signal is being prepared by the circuitry of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. Decoding occurs at gate A. One BXP signal of eight (BXP&lt;0:7&gt;) is enabled when the wordline is activated, as represented by receipt of the Dummy Wordline Decode signal at gate B. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, that BXP, for example BXP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is transferred to a local bitswitch pair as a local bitswitch signal LBXP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> wherever a block write BW for the group <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is enabled. LBXP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> turns on the local bitswitches for true and reference bitlines numbered &ldquo;1&rdquo;, and those true and reference bitlines are now connected to the true and complement fan nodes FT and FC, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The activated wordline within the memory array permits charge to flow from memory cells connected to the wordline onto true bitlines. At least one of the true bitlines now connects the true fan node FT through a conducting, true bitline to a memory cell for writing. The voltages on the conducting true and reference bitlines then approach the voltages present at the respective fan nodes. Thus, a small voltage difference write signal of about VWRITE referenced to ground has been applied between the true and reference bitlines. A set signal now sets the sense amplifier at group <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> which amplifies the small voltage difference write signal into full swing logic levels being a predetermined high voltage, for example 1.2 V and a predetermined low voltage, for example 0.0 V, on the true and reference bitlines, respectively. The set signal also turns off the local bitswitches by disabling the global bitswitch signals (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>), which isolates the primary sense amplifier of group <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> from the fan nodes FT and FC to permit the small voltage difference signal to be amplified to full swing logic levels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> While the wordline remains activated, the voltage at the memory cell rises or falls to a level close to that of the predetermined high or low voltage logic level that is now present on the true bitline. Thereafter the wordline is deactivated, thereby ending the write operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, all drawn on same voltage and time scales show signals during the write operation. Timing for the wordline activating signal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, local bitswitch signal <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and sense amplifier set signal <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows voltages at true bitline <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, reference bitline <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and true fan node <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, respectively. The VWRITE voltage <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> and the voltage <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> at the memory cell being written in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> With reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, a read operation to a memory cell numbered <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> within a group <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> begins with signals in the following initial conditions, BW high, all BXPs and LBXPs including BXP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and LBXP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> low, LBWRITEP low, WRPREC low, LBRESTN high, LBREADP low, and SREADP low. The read operation is begun by precharging fan nodes FT and FC to Vdd by the signal LBRESTN going low to turn on read precharge devices <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. The READ signal disables low impedance voltage divider <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> for VWRITE. LBRESTN goes high again after precharging. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The wordline is activated and a small voltage difference signal develops between true and reference bitlines at a primary sense amplifier within a group <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Local bitswitches remain low because output of global bitswitch signal generator (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) remains disabled by the READ signal and the disabled sense amplifier set signal. Next, the sense amplifier set signal is enabled which amplifies the small voltage signal between true and reference bitlines to predetermined high and low voltages, on all of the bitlines in each group <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> connected to the activated wordline. A local bitswitch pair in the group, for example LBXP<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, also turns on at this time with the enabling of a global bitswitch BXP<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, thereby permitting the amplified logic levels on true and reference bitlines to be tranferred to the true and complement fan nodes FT and FC. Signal SREADP at local buffer <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> causes cross-coupled devices <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> to regenerate and maintain predetermined high and low voltage logic levels on fan nodes FT and FC. Finally, at an appropriate time, LBREADP gates the datum read from the memory cell onto an output bus PDOT. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, all drawn on the same voltage and time scales, show signals during the read operation. Timing for the wordline activating signal <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, local bitswitch signal <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, and sense amplifier set signal <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> are as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> shows voltages at true bitline <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, reference bitline <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> and true fan node <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, respectively. The voltage <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> at the memory cell being read is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
