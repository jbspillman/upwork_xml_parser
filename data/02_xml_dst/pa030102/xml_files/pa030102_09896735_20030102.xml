<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to cassettes for photographic elements, and more particularly, to an x-ray cassette used in computed radiography. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In the field of computed radiography, a photographic element has an image formed thereon by x-rays. The photographic element is subsequently provided to a reader wherein the element is stimulated to emit a radiation pattern that is indicative of the image formed by the x-rays. Typically, storage phosphors are used to capture radiographic images from incident x-rays. Most radiographic procedures are carried out within normal room lighting conditions, accordingly, a primary requirement for any computed radiography x-ray cassette is to shield the storage phosphor from exposure by ambient light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Cassettes of the kind used in computed radiography may comprise a container having an upper and lower parts that are hinged together so that they can be opened for insertion of a flexible film sheet or a rigid film plate comprising the photographic element. The cassette is closed and latched so that the cassette with the element therein can be used with an x-ray apparatus to produce an image on the photographic element. Then, the cassette is taken to a reader where the cassette is opened and the photographic element extracted by suitable feeders, such as a suction feeding device. The photographic element separates from the cassette, and is transported through the reader where it is stimulated to emit a radiation pattern which is captured for storage and use. The radiation pattern is subsequently erased from the photographic element before being returned to the cassette for re-use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,861,631, 5,869,839, and 5,943,390 commonly assigned and incorporated herein by reference, disclose cassettes of the kind used in computed radiography. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> While such cassettes may have achieved certain degrees of success in their particular applications, cassettes are susceptible to various types of damage when dropped or roughly handled. Accordingly, it is desirable to increase the durability of the cassette while minimizing cost and weight, and preserving the same basic nature of design. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, a need continues to exist for a cassette which is durable and is not susceptible to damage when dropped or roughly handled, improves light integrity, yet cost and weight is minimized, and the same basic nature of design is preserved. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The following is a detailed description of the preferred embodiments of the invention, reference being made to the drawings in which the same reference numerals identify the same elements of structure in each of the several figures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> show a storage phosphor cassette <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in accordance with the present invention. Cassette <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a shell <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> comprising an upper panel <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a lower panel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, a first side member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, a second side member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and a front end member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Upper and lower panels <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are preferably rectangular in shape. First side member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, second side member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and front end member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> join upper and lower panels <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to form a five-sided cavity having an open end <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Cassette <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> further includes a storage phosphor assembly <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> having a back end member <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, an insert plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> having an upper face, and a storage phosphor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> disposed on the upper face of insert plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The front end of insert plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> includes corners <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, which are preferably rounded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Storage phosphor assembly <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is removably contained within the cavity of shell <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> such that back end member <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of storage phosphor assembly <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> closes off open end <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of shell <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, thereby providing a light-tight enclosure for storage phosphor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Back end member <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of storage phosphor assembly <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> includes end portions <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. First and second side members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> include a corner structure <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, respectively, which respectively engage end portions <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. Corner structures <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> can be integral with first and second side members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, or as illustrated, can be separate corner pieces which are secured to first and second side members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. End portions <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and respective corner structures <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> have complimentary, interlocking configurations, such that, should cassette <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> be dropped and a force exerted on either corner structure <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, the force is transferred to storage phosphor assembly <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, forcing assembly <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> into shell <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> To join first side member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, second side member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and front end member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> with upper and lower panels <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, at least one corner element <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is employed. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, two corner elements <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are employed, one at each end of front end member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, to form two corners of cassette <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Corner element <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is more particularly shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Corner element <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a corner portion <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, an upper corner channel <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, a lower corner channel <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, a first leg <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, an inclined element <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, and a second leg <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Corner portion <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> forms a corner section of cassette <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Upper corner channel <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is adapted to receive a corner of upper panel <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Lower corner channel <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is adapted to receive a corner of lower panel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. As best illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4, 5</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, upper and lower corner channels <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are configured as parallel slots so as to mate with upper and lower panels <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which are configured as being parallel and planar. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> First leg <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is adapted to mate with either first side member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> or second side member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Second leg <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is adapted to mate with front end member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, first and second leg <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> are configured to be inserted into members <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, though those skilled in the art may recognize other mating arrangements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> An inclined element <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is integrally formed with first leg <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. As illustrated, incline element <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is spaced from upper and lower corner channels <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. As shown, upper and lower channels <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are parallel, and first leg <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is perpendicular to second leg <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. Inclined element <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> includes a face <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> forming an acute angle relative to first leg <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, with the taper of inclined element <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> directed toward second leg <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. That is, inclined element <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is tapered from a first end <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> to a second end <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, wherein the taper at second end <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> has a higher elevation. An acute angle in the range of between about 5 degrees to about 45 degrees has been found to be suitable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> When corner element <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> joins upper and lower panels <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to define the cavity of shell <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> therebetween, inclined element <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is configured to be disposed within the cavity of shell <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. This is best illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. As such, when storage phosphor assembly <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is contained within the cavity of shell <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, front corners <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> would be adjacent to inclined element <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> so that front corners <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> can abut inclined element <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> during insertion of storage phosphor assembly <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. As such, inclined element <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> acts as a guide portion for the insertion of storage phosphor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> into shell <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and further acts as a shock absorber for front corners <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. In addition, should cassette <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> be dropped or roughly handled, inclined element <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> provides a bumper or shock absorber for corner edges <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, face <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> of inclined element <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> at second end <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> preferably has a dimension D which is greater than a width W of first leg <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. Such a feature assists in the light integrity of cassette <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. That is, should there exist an opening at a butt joint, in the extrusion interface between members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> with upper and lower panels <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, or in corner element <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the increased dimension of face <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> will form a labyrinth, thereby assisting in the light-tightness of the cassette. Such a labyrinth is formed when corner element <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> seats securely with members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Referring again to FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, a light shielding member <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> disposed at second end <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of inclined element <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> further assists in the light-tightness of cassette <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. When corner element <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> seats securely with members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> within the cavity, light shielding member <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> abuts side member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The increased dimension of light shielding member <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> forms a labyrinth, thereby further assisting in the light-tightness of the cassette. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> First leg <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> may optionally include a recess <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to permit the mechanical fastening of the elements of the x-ray cassette, for example, first and/or second side members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to upper and/or lower panels <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
