<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a front view of a first embodiment of an open-faced portal covering device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprising a portal covering such as a door or window <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a rotating handle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Rotating handle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be substantially loop shaped or U-shaped so that a user can grab onto handle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Handle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is coupled to a rotatable shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> that is rotatably coupled to cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> via a series of C-shaped locks <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Disposed at one end of rotatable shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is a gear <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> such as a bevel gear, that is shaped frusto-conically so that it meshes with an adjacent frusto-conically shaped gear <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Frusto-conically shaped gear <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is coupled to rotatable shaft <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Rotatable shaft <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is rotatably coupled to cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> via a second series of C-shaped locks <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. These locks <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> allow shaft <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to rotate inside. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Disposed on an opposite end of gear <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, is gear <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> which rotates as shaft <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> rotates. Gear <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> meshes with fixed gear <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which is coupled to shaft <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Shaft <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is fixed inside of door frame <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In operation, as a user grabs handle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, to open door <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, handle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> rotates, rotating shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> rotates within C-shaped locks <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> so that it turns gear <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. As gear <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> rotates, it rotates gear <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> rotating shaft <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> within C-shaped locks <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Gear <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, which is coupled to rotating shaft <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> rotates with shaft <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> around fixed gear <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Thus, as a person grabs door handle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, it automatically starts door or cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> turning within its hinges and rotating within frame <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a front view of a second embodiment of an open door containing the rotating handle. In this embodiment, shaft <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is placed at the bottom of cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> wherein shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> also extends down through C-shaped locks <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> so that gear <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> meshes with gear <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. With this design the above listed components work together in a manner similar to that of the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a front view of the third embodiment of the invention. With this design, shaft <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> extends diagonally down from stationary gear <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to gear <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, so that gear <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> meshes with gear <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and gear <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> meshes with gear <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. C-shaped locks <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> hold shaft <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in place so that while gear <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> rotates with gear <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> shaft <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> revolves around a single axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a front view of an open faced cover wherein in this embodiment, there are two direct drives <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> that are used in place of gears <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> respectively. Direct drives are essentially closed compartments of meshed gears that can be either bevel gears, miter gears, worm gears or any other type of joining apparatus that is used to join to rotatable shafts together at a substantially right angle. In addition, in this embodiment, handle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has a rotatable center region <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&prime; which allows this center region to rotate about a vertical axis as the entire handle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> rotates within cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In that way, the user does not have to loosen his or her grip on handle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> as it is rotating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> All four embodiments provide the benefit of a door handle that rotates with a door as the door rotates. This handle type arrangement is designed to both rotate in response to the rotation of the door or window but also to help initiate the rotation of the door or window. When a user pulls on handle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, it starts shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> rotating thus starting gear <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> rotating as well. As gear <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> rotates it rotates gear <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> thus also turning shaft <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and opposite gear <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The initiation of rotation of gear <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> against stationary gear <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> starts covering <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> rotating within frame <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, while several embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it is to be understood that many changes and modifications may be made thereunto without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims. </paragraph>
