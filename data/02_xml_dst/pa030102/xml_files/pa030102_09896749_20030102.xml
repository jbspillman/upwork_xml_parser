<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention is broadly concerned with improved aircraft crew vision masks which can be rapidly donned during a smoke in cockpit emergency and which include a head-mounted display device such as a retinal scanning display device operably mounted on the mask and coupled with a source aircraft flight information (e.g., flight instrumentation) in order that flight information is directly scanned onto the retina of a wearer&apos;s eye, thereby allowing the wearer to view the flight information notwithstanding the presence of cockpit smoke. More particularly, the invention is concerned with such masks which in preferred forms include automatic sensor-responsive and manual control capabilities for the retinal scanning device, so that the wearer may selectively turn the display on or off, or change the information input thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Among the dangerous and even catastrophic emergencies encountered during aircraft flight is the existence of smoke in the cockpit. This stems from the fact that while the pilot may have an adequate source of breathable gas and his eyes may be protected from irritants, nonetheless he may be unable to see the instrument panel and have adequate vision through the aircraft windshield owing to accumulated smoke. Indeed, in the recent past two commercial airliners have been lost after the aircrew reported smoke within the cockpit, this occurring even though the crew successively donned oxygen masks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> One response to this problem is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,202,796 and is referred to as the EVAS (Emergency Vision Assurance) system. In this device, a clear plastic airbag is provided adjacent the instrument panel. In the event of a smoke emergency, the pilot pulls a tab, which inflates the airbag. The pilot can then press his face against the inflated transparent bag in order to see the instrument panel. The size of the bag also inherently limits the field of view of the user. However, this relatively unsophisticated device presents a number of problems. First, the pilot must keep his face firmly against the inflated bag, which means that he cannot attend to other emergency conditions which may require attention. Furthermore, the device takes 15-20 seconds to deploy, which represents a rather significant time lag before any instrument vision is restored. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Conventional heads up displays (HUDs) have been used in civilian and military aircraft for a number of years, to display instrumentation and targeting information for example. These types of devices are not generally useful in a smoky cockpit situation, because dense smoke in the cockpit will prevent the pilot from actually seeing the display, or may disrupt system projection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Head-mounted displays have been proposed in the past for use in various contexts. For example, retinal scanning displays (also known as VRD displays) have been suggested as vision enhancers in fire fighting equipment and the like. Retinal scanning displays differ from heads up displays and similar technologies in that an image is raster scanned directly onto the retina of user, as opposed to being projected onto another surface. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,097,353. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,420,828 describes a viewing screen assembly for mounting on helmets or face masks, particularly in the context of fire fighter&apos;s helmets. The device described in this patent is designed to accept video input from a remote person or location. U.S. Pat. No. 6,078,427 describes head-mounted displays for use with flight simulators, which may include a virtual retinal display device. U.S. Pat. No. 5,091,719 describes a helmet display for use on aircraft pilot helmets. This reference does not disclose the use of retinal scanning displays, nor is the problem of smoke addressed. See also U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,170,979, 6,157,291 and 6,137,457. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The present invention overcomes the problems outlined above and provides an improved aircraft crew vision mask equipped with a visual display device such as a retinal scanning display device and operably coupled with one or more sources of aircraft flight information in order to display such information as a part of a retinal scan during a smoke in the cockpit emergency. Generally speaking, the vision mask comprises a substantially transparent lens with a face seal disposed about and supporting the lens, and with a harness assembly for mounting the mask on the face of a wearer so that the wearer may look through the lens. The retinal scanning display device is operably mounted on the mask and is oriented to generate a retinal scan on a retina of the wearer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the mask is of the full-face variety and includes apparatus for delivery of breathable gas to the wearer. It is contemplated that the mask of the invention would be normally stowed in a location adjacent the wearer until an emergency develops; at this point, the mask may be grasped and pulled from stowage in the manner identical to present-day emergency oxygen masks. To this end, it is preferred that the mask be equipped with an inflatable harness which expands to a relatively large size upon removal of the mask from stowage, in order to facilitate donning of the mask. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The visual display device is preferably secured to the mask exterior at the face seal of the mask and includes an output substantially at the wearer&apos;s eye level. In one form, the RSD depends from the face seal of the mask, and has an output at eye level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In order to activate the display, the preferred vision mask has a sensor which detects a parameter indicative of visible smoke or conditions which precede the generation of visible smoke, such as an ion detector. The sensor is coupled with the flight information source(s) and the display for this purpose. Also, a manual controller is also provided, which gives on/off capability and also the option of switching between different information inputs. For example, the usable information may be selected from the group consisting of aircraft airspeed, attitude, altitude, heading, vertical speed, navigation information, video from camera(s) external to or within the aircraft, flight manual information, and combinations thereof, and the wearer may wish to switch between various ones of these inputs.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Turning now to the drawing, an aircraft crew vision mask <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, mounted on the head of a wearer. Broadly speaking, the mask <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a transparent, preferably flexible lens <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with a peripheral, synthetic resin or elastomeric face seal <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the mask <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is a &ldquo;full-face&rdquo; mask and is equipped with apparatus for delivering breathable gas to the wearer, including a gas mask <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> designed to cover the nose and mouth region of the wearer, a regulator <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and breathable gas input line <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The overall mask <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> further includes an inflatable harness <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> which allows the wearer to rapidly don the mask during emergency situations. Finally, the mask <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is also equipped with a retinal scanning display device <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> which is supported on seal <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and depends therefrom to present, substantially at the wearer&apos;s eye level, an output <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the display device <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> includes a modulated light source <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which may be monochrome or have multiple light sources for color display. The light source <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is coupled with horizontal and vertical scanners <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> leading to output <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The device <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is also provided with drive electronics <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> (typically including a microprocessor) which control the operation of the light source <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and scanners <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. It will be appreciated that retinal scanning devices of the type used in the invention are known and commercially available from Microvision, Inc. of Sheridan, Wyo. In general, these scanning devices are designed to generate a raster scan image directly upon the retina <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of the wearer&apos;s eye <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, as schematically illustrated by marginal light beams <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Typical retinal display devices are illustrated and explained in U.S. Pat. No. 6,097,353, incorporated by reference herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The input to retinal scanning display <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may be any aircraft flight information, and is denoted <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. That is, the information to be displayed via device <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in the present invention may be any desired information relating to the flight or aircraft, such as airspeed, attitude, altitude, heading, vertical speed, navigation information, video from camera(s) external to or within the aircraft, flight manual information, and combinations thereof. Typically, the input information would be derived at least in part from the normal aircraft instrumentation as seen by the pilot during normal flight conditions. For example, one specific input may be from a Garmin Color IRF GFS NAV/COM with glideslope and moving map; this device is available from Garmin International, Inc. of Olathe, Kans. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The operation of display device <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may be initiated automatically through sensor <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> or manually through input control <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>; as shown, these components are operatively connected with the drive electronics <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and the information input <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The sensor <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is designed to detect a parameter indicative of visible smoke or conditions preceding the generation of visible smoke, such as an ion detector. When the sensor <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> detects such a parameter at a predetermined magnitude, signal is generated which controls the drive electronics <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and input information <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to thereby begin generation of the desired retinal display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The manual input control <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> allows the wearer to begin operation of the retinal display <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> even if no smoke-related conditions exist. Also, in preferred forms, the manual control includes an on/off control switch permitting the wearer to turn off the display <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, and/or may include a channel select switch allowing the wearer to switch between different sources of input information (e.g., the wearer may elect to switch between altitude and airspeed information to flight manual information), or selected information may be projected on one page. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> An especially preferred mask <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in accordance with the invention is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,664,566 incorporated by reference herein. This type of quick-donning full-face mask with inflatable harness allows the wearer to rapidly pull the mask from a stowage location while the harness inflates to an enlarged size, whereupon the mask can be pulled over the wearer&apos;s head and face followed by deflation of the harness to hold the mask firmly in place. It will be understood, however, that the invention is not limited to any particular type of mask and may be a simple visor mask without supplemental gas equipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> During normal flight conditions, the mask <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> would be stowed adjacent the crew member. In the event of an emergency the crew member grasps the mask and pulls it from its stowed position. This automatically initiates inflation of the harness for quick donning as described. If the emergency includes smoke in the cockpit or conditions preceding the generation of visible smoke exist, the sensor <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> comes into play to begin operation of display device <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The default display would be preselected and would normally comprise the most important flight instrumentation readings such as airspeed, attitude and altitude. However, the wearer may change the display through appropriate manipulation of manual control <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, which as explained also allows on/off selection and also channel selection for different desired display information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> A significant advantage obtained through use of the scanning device <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> stems from the fact that the pilot need not restrict his movements to continue viewing the display, i.e., the display mounted on the vision mask &ldquo;moves with&rdquo; the pilot, as compared with HUDs which have a limited viewing perspective. Also, retinal scanning displays offer further benefits, in that visibility does not vary with external light levels, so that display quality and image clarity remain unaffected even in heavy smoke. While the described embodiment is a purpose-built vision mask, it will be understood that otherwise conventional masks could readily be retrofitted with display devices in accordance with the invention. </paragraph>
