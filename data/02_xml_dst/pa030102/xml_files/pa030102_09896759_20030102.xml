<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Technical Field </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention generally relates to skylights, and more specifically relates to a skylight adapted to release condensation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Prior to the development and wide-spread adoption of electric lighting, skylights were popular in architectural design because of their ability to naturally illuminate indoor spaces that were not suitable for or accessible to a standard window. Even now, when electric lighting is almost universally available, natural light is often preferred. Thus, though the motivation for installing skylights may have changed, they have nevertheless retained much of their popularity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> If skylights are to conduct light from the exterior of a structure to its interior there must be an opening in that structure that communicates between the interior and the exterior. Moisture that penetrates the skylight thus has a relatively unobstructed path along this opening to the interior of the structure, where it can cause obvious problems. Most skylights include flashing to reduce leakage through the opening in the structure. However, condensation, which is the deposition of a liquid or a solid on a surface that is at a different, generally lower, temperature than the surrounding gas, remains problematic because its presence inside the skylight does not depend upon leakage. In the context of a skylight this means that the difference in the temperature between the interior and the exterior of the skylight may cause condensation on the interior surface of the skylight. If this condensation is not removed, the moisture may reduce the clarity of the skylight or even damage the structure in which the skylight resides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In order to prevent the buildup of condensation, some skylights include drainage holes located at the base of the light-admitting cap that allow moisture to escape to the skylight&apos;s exterior. For several reasons, this construction is problematic. Drainage holes tend to admit the entry into the skylight of dust and bugs, which then must be removed in a time-consuming process. Furthermore, locating these drainage holes on the light-admitting cap is expensive, difficult, and requires a high profile skylight that detracts from the appearance of the roof line and of the entire structure. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Therefore, there existed a need to provide a skylight system capable of reducing or eliminating condensation while avoiding the shortcomings of the prior art. According to an embodiment of the present invention, a skylight system comprises a light-admitting cap adapted to fit over a flashing having indents therein. These indents are described herein as grooves, but may also take other forms such as circular or otherwise symmetrical indentations. As used herein, grooves means elongate channels. The grooves are constructed to limit or prevent the passage of unwanted objects, such as bugs and dust, yet allow moisture to pass therethrough. The grooves may be placed in the flashing rather than the cap so as to allow the cap&apos;s form to be less obtrusive than would otherwise be possible, though it will be understood that the grooves may in some embodiments, where a lower profile is a lesser concern, be located in the cap, or anywhere within a contact zone formed by the union of the cap and the flashing. The flashing may be formed of a single piece of material, such as aluminum or similar material, to reduce the likelihood of warping, or of cracks forming therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The skylight system may further have an extension tube and an inner trim ring with filter and diffuser. The extension tube integrates with the skylight&apos;s flashing and is placed within an opening in the structure extending from roof to ceiling. The inner trim ring attaches to the bottom of the extension tube where the tube penetrates the ceiling, and the filter and diffuser broadcast the natural light thus admitted into the structure&apos;s interior space. The skylight herein described is thus more attractive, cleaner, less permeable to unwanted foreign matter, and more easily and less expensively manufactured than earlier skylight assemblies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The foregoing and other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following more particular description of certain embodiments of the invention, as illustrated in the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The present invention is a skylight system that keeps out unwanted foreign matter and has a reduced exterior profile. According to an embodiment of the present invention, a skylight system comprises a light-admitting cap adapted to fit over a grooved flashing. The grooves are constructed such that they will not admit the passage of unwanted objects, such as bugs and dust, and they may in one embodiment be placed in the flashing rather than the cap so as to allow the cap&apos;s form to be less obtrusive than would otherwise be possible. The flashing is formed of a single piece of material, which may be aluminum, to reduce the likelihood of warping, or of cracks forming therein. The system further includes an extension tube communicating between the structure&apos;s exterior and a desired location inside the structure, and an inner trim ring with a filter and a diffuser adapted to moderate the intensity of the admitted light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Referring to the figures, and in particular to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> skylight system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to the present invention is installed in a structure <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which has an exterior surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and an interior surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Skylight system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a light-admitting cap <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, a flashing <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, an extension tube <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, an inner trim ring <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, and a cover <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Light-admitting cap <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, in the pictured embodiment, comprises a dome <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a dome ring <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Flashing <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> includes a base <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Cap <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and flashing <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> come together to form at least a partial seal between them, the seal area being a contact zone, as will be more fully described in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Structure <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may conventionally be a dwelling place such as a house, in which case exterior surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be the roof of the house and interior surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be the ceiling inside. Structure <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> thus may at times herein be referred to as house <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and exterior surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and interior surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may at times be referred to herein as, respectively, roof <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and ceiling <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. However, it should be understood that skylight system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is not limited to installation in houses with roofs and ceilings, but may be installed in any structure where it is desirable to bring into the interior of a structure light originating from a source exterior to the structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Light-admitting cap <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is generally the uppermost component of skylight system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, meaning that it generally covers the top of tube <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and extends farther above roof <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> than the other components of system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. While cap <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may possess any of several shapes, the pictured dome shape is conventional. Cap <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is constructed of a clear, transparent, translucent, or otherwise light-permeable material. Dome <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be a 100 percent impact acrylic dome. When the sun or other light source located outside structure <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> shines on roof <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, cap <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> admits the light and allows it to pass into extension tube <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Cap <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be advantageously placed at a location where the amount of light it receives will be maximized. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, cap <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, after installation on roof <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, is oriented such that an axis taken through the center of cap <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is perpendicular to ceiling <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Other orientations are, of course, also possible. If the light source is the sun, the pictured orientation is convenient in that it allows sunlight, when not obscured by intervening objects, to penetrate cap <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> during a large percentage of the time the sun is above the horizon, no matter where on the earth structure <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is located. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> As is true in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, it is common practice for roof <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of structure <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to be sloped or angled with respect to level ground. In order that cap <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be oriented as described in the preceding paragraph, flashing <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> must compensate for the slope by possessing an angled neck, as will be more fully explained in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Base <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of flashing <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> rests on roof <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and surrounds an opening, not shown, in roof <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> provided for the purpose of inserting extension tube <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The union of flashing <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and roof <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is sealed against the entry of water and other unwanted substances or items in a manner that is well known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Extension tube <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> conducts light from where it is gathered at cap <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to where it is wanted below ceiling <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in structure <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Many houses <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> have attics, crawlspaces, or other intervening areas <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> between roof <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and ceiling <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Extension tube <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> contains and conducts light through intervening area <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to the interior space of house <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> without the scattering or loss that would occur if tube <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> were not present. In a structure <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> lacking intervening area <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, an embodiment of skylight system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> omitting extension tube <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may conveniently be used. Inner trim ring <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> attaches to extension tube <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> where tube <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> penetrates ceiling <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Cover <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> depends from trim ring <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and cover <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and trim ring <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> together give skylight system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> a finished, pleasing appearance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, flashing <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> comprises base <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, a neck <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and a collar <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Collar <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, in one embodiment, includes grooves <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in an outside surface <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and a gasket <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> on an inside surface <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. Collar <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> further includes an upper edge <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. A lower perimeter <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of neck <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> marks the transition from base <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> to neck <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Similarly, an upper perimeter <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> marks the transition from neck <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to collar <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Neck <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> has an inner surface <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, a least height <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, and a greatest height <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Inside surface <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of dome ring <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) fits over outside surface <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of collar <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, thereby forming a contact zone that forms at least a partial seal between cap <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and flashing <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Although grooves <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> will repeatedly herein be described as located in collar <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, one of ordinary skill in the art will readily understand that grooves <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may in some embodiments of the invention be placed elsewhere within the contact zone formed between inside surface <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and outside surface <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, such as in dome ring <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, light-admitting cap <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> comprises, as discussed in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, dome <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and dome ring <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Dome ring <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> has an inner surface <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, an outer surface <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, and a lower edge <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. A rolled edge <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of dome ring <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> cups a flange <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> of dome <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Flange <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> is visible in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> but is not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. An adhesive layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is located between flange <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> of dome <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and rolled edge <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. Cap <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> further comprises mounting apertures <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, which extend completely through dome ring <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> With continued reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, the same opening through which skylight system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> admits light may also become the entry point for unwanted material or objects. As has been discussed, the opening must penetrate both roof <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and ceiling <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and provide a continuous path in between, thus offering an obvious conduit for the admission of such objects. One of the functions of flashing <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is to prevent the entry of items such as water, bugs, and dust. Flashing <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> does this in several ways, as discussed below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Flashing <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is in one embodiment formed from a single piece of material. Aluminum, because of its resistance to rust, is one material that may be used, though it should be understood that the present invention is in no way limited to aluminum or to any other particular material. The unitary construction of flashing <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> eliminates the cracks and stresses that sometimes occur at the junction of separate pieces. For example, if base <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> had originally been a separate piece that was later welded to neck <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the weld junction would tend to weaken over time and its integrity would be compromised. The present invention contemplates reducing that possibility by using, in certain of its embodiments, the unitary construction for flashing <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. As stated, lower perimeter <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> marks the transition zone between base <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and neck <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. In a conventional embodiment of skylight system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, lower perimeter <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is the midpoint of a smooth, shoulder-like change in direction of the material of flashing <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. This smooth shoulder may also be less prone to leaks or cracks than an abrupt transition would be. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Base <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is relatively broad and flat and may be shaped like a disk, although many other shapes are also possible. For example, base <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> may be square, rectangular, oval, or any one of many other shapes without departing from the spirit of the invention. The diameter or other dimensions of base <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> may vary depending on the model as well as other considerations. In order to comply with building codes, base <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> may be at least four inches wide, while least height <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of neck <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may be at least four inches. Neck <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> rises out of the plane defined by base <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Neck <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> varies in height as measured from base <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, with least height <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and greatest height <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> being the two extremes. As discussed in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, neck <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may be angled so as to compensate for a roof <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> that is sloped with respect to level ground. Many roofs are sloped in this way, and in order that light-admitting cap <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be oriented substantially parallel to level ground, and thus increase its light-gathering capacity, neck <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may have the slope described. The height difference between least height <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and greatest height <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> may be calculated to correspond to the slope of roof <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, although this is not a necessary feature of the present invention. Regarding the actual dimensions of least height <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, as well the other parts of neck <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the invention contemplates a wide range of measurements, with consideration in practice being given to the idea that many customers prefer that skylight system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> be as unobtrusive as possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Upper perimeter <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is similar to lower perimeter <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in that it marks the transition between neck <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and collar <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Upper perimeter <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> may demarcate a transition that is slightly more abrupt than that at lower perimeter <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, though a smooth transition at upper perimeter <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is also possible. In the first-mentioned embodiment, the abruptness of upper perimeter <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> encourages a snug interface between dome ring <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and neck <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The general orientation of neck <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is similar to the general orientation of collar <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Therefore, in order for the transition at upper perimeter <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to be abrupt, and the resulting fit snug, a portion of neck <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> must be oriented differently from the orientation of the general body of neck <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. This differently-oriented portion is apparent in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, where a contour line <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> indicates the presence of a shelf <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> in neck <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Shelf <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> comprises a transition zone between the main portion of neck <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the true transition point between neck <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and collar <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> marked by upper perimeter <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Shelf <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> advantageously runs in a continuous ring around neck <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> distal from base <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, and may in one embodiment measure significantly less from side to side than does collar <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> from top to bottom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Referring still to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, light-admitting cap <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is adapted to fit over collar <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, with inside surface <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of dome ring <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> sliding over and contacting outside surface <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of collar <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Collar <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and dome ring <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may have a height exceeding roughly a quarter inch so as to provide adequate surface area for a good union. However, as will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art, other dimensions are also possible. The smooth union between dome ring <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and collar <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is interrupted in various places by grooves <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, which may be cut into collar <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Grooves <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may be located at substantially equal intervals around the entire circumference of collar <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. It should be pointed out, however, that not only are other spacings contemplated, but collar <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, as stated elsewhere, need not be circular in shape but may be square, rectangular, oval, or otherwise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Grooves <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may, in one embodiment of skylight system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, be oriented substantially perpendicular to upper perimeter <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and upper edge <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, and may extend along a substantial portion of the distance between them. In another embodiment, grooves <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may extend along a smaller portion of collar <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. One possible length for grooves <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> ts approximately one inch, though shorter or longer grooves are also contemplated. Grooves <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may in one embodiment have a depth of approximately 0.020 inches, though one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that greater or lesser depths are also possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> When light-admitting cap <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is attached to collar <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of flashing <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in accordance with the present invention, conditions may be such that condensation forms on an inside surface <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of dome <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, as indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. In general, condensation appears on a surface when the surface is at a different temperature than the surrounding gas. Quite typically, the surface on which the condensation appears is at a lower temperature than is the gas. In a conventional arrangement where skylight system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is installed in a structure <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, intervening area <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> above ceiling <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> contains air that is at an elevated temperature. Inside surface <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, under certain conditions, may be at a lower temperature than the air in intervening space <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, setting up a condition conducive to the deposition of condensation on inside surface <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> If left to accumulate, this condensation may stream down inside surface <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and into extension tube <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, eventually making its way to inner trim ring <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> where it may collect inside cover <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> or seep out into ceiling <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. To avoid this consequence, skylight system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> must be provided with an outlet for condensation whereby the moisture deposited on inside surface <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> may be allowed to escape to the exterior of system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In the present invention, grooves <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> serve this purpose. They are of sufficient size to allow condensation to exit skylight system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, but in general are too shallow for bugs to pass through. Further, the orientation of grooves <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> discourages the passage of dust in that a dust particle would have to first enter the small space <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, and then travel vertically upwards, against gravity, before passing into the interior of dome <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The process whereby condensation travels along grooves <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and exits exterior to skylight system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will be further explained in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Locating grooves <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in collar <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is in many cases easier and cheaper than locating them in dome ring <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> because of the tool sizes and configurations required. The placement of grooves <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in collar <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, or elsewhere in the contact zone formed by the union of inside surface <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of dome ring <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and outside surface <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of collar <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, also allows flashing <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to be constructed with a lower profile at rolled edge <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, which may provide a more pleasing appearance than skylights with higher profiles would have. If grooves or other indents <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> were located in rolled edge <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, rolled edge <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> would necessarily include more material, be larger, and extend further away from dome <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, creating a larger profile that is less pleasing and attractive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In addition to grooves <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, collar <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may include gasket <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Gasket <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> may be located on inner surface <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> of collar <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. From this location, or from other locations where it may alternatively be placed, gasket <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> may catch and collect any moisture, bugs, dust, or other unwanted material that in spite of the above-mentioned features employed to reduce the occurrence, passes into and is present inside dome <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Gasket <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> may take any one of a variety of embodiments such as a rubber ring or a metal lip. In one embodiment gasket <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> may comprise a dense strip of flexible fibers securely attached to an adhesive strip, not shown. The adhesive strip may be adapted to the shape of collar <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and then pressed into place on inside surface <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Base <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is attached and sealed to roof <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in a manner well known in the art. In addition to the structural features discussed above, the attachment and sealing are performed so as to prevent the entry of water and other items into structure <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Referring still to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, adhesive layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> bonds dome <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to dome ring <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Adhesive layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> may comprise silicone, or it may comprise another adhesive substance. Adhesive layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is located in the vicinity of rolled edge <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. One method of applying adhesive layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to light-admitting cap <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is to (1) place a bead of silicone, or other adhesive, on inner surface <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of dome ring <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> before rolled edge <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> has been formed, (2) position dome <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> interior to dome ring <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> such that flange <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> of dome <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is at or near the level of adhesive layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, then (3) crimp or bend the edge of dome ring <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> such that it rolls around flange <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, creating rolled edge <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. Adhesive layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> then fills at least a part of the interior of rolled edge <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and thus may contact both top and bottom of flange <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. Alternative methods of attachment, either using adhesive layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> or some other method, may also be possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Mounting apertures <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> may be placed within dome ring <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> below rolled edge <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. Apertures <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> extend completely through dome ring <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and are adapted to receive mounting devices such as screws, bolts, pins, or other mounting devices, not shown in the figures. After passing through mounting apertures <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, the mounting devices may be inserted partially or completely into flashing <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Mounting apertures <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> may be placed in dome ring <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, thus placing less stress and strain on dome <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> from the pressure due to mounting devices <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Such placement may prevent or minimize structural failure or damage. A spinning process may be used to attach dome <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to dome ring <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in order to avoid shattering or other damage due to stresses on dome <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. When light-admitting cap <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is placed on flashing <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and attached as just described, lower edge <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of dome ring <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> rests on or near shelf <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> of upper perimeter <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of flashing <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> depicts a stream of condensation exiting skylight system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> along a groove <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The figure is a cross sectional or cutaway view of portions of light-admitting cap <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and flashing <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Flange <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> of dome <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is here visible extending into rolled edge <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of dome ring <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Adhesive layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> may be seen between flange <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and rolled edge <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, as earlier described. Dome <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has an outside surface <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and an inside surface <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. It is on inside surface <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of dome <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that condensation droplets <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> generally form. Droplets <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> slide down inside surface <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of dome <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, cross adhesive layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, and enter a gap <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> between dome ring <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and collar <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, groove <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> does not extend along collar <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> all the way to upper edge <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, although in other embodiments that construction is a possibility. Here, condensation droplet <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> negotiates gap <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, eventually reaching the point somewhat below upper edge <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> where groove <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> begins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> This cutaway view is taken lengthwise through one of the grooves <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> from a point at or near the center of the groove. As may be seen, groove <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> conducts condensation droplets <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> along its length and deposits them outside skylight system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> below dome ring <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in the vicinity of neck <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and upper perimeter <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, from where droplets <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> may evaporate, fall away from skylight <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, or otherwise dissipate. It may further be seen that while groove <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> provides a channel along which droplets <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> may travel, dome ring <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> presses very closely upon the non-grooved portions of collar <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and thus offers little opportunity for foreign or unwanted matter to enter skylight system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. An exit point <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> near upper perimeter <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> offers only a very narrow aperture through which condensation droplets <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> exit groove <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, and through which it would be difficult for any substance or item to enter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, inner trim ring <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is shown separated into its components. Cover <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is also shown. Inner trim ring <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> comprises a fixed ring <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, a twist-on ring <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, and a filter <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. Fixed ring <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> includes a ridge <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and a base <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. Ceiling mounting apertures <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> alternate with keyhole apertures <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> in base <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. Keyhole apertures <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> are oblong in shape, with a larger opening in one end and a smaller opening in the other end, in a manner well known in the art. Ridge <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> has an inner surface <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> on which is attached a gasket <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. Twist-on ring <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> includes standoffs <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, an opening <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, and a ledge <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, and filter <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> includes through-holes <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. Cover <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has a rim <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> A manner in which inner trim ring <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is assembled and attached to the rest of skylight system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will now be described. Fixed ring <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is brought close to extension tube <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, which is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Inner surface <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> of ridge <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> slides over the outside of extension tube <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and gasket <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> contacts tube <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Suitable mounting devices are inserted through ceiling mounting apertures <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> from the side of fixed ring <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> opposite ridge <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and then into ceiling <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, whereby fixed ring <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is secured to ceiling <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, not shown. Cover <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is then placed within opening <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> of twist-on ring <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, with rim <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> resting on ledge <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. The circumference of cover <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> advantageously exceeds the circumference of opening <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> so that cover <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may rest on twist-on ring <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. Through-holes <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> in filter <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> are next placed over standoffs <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> in twist-on ring <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. With cover <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and filter <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> thus in place, twist-on ring <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is brought close to fixed ring <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, standoffs <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> are inserted into the larger ends of keyhole apertures <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, and twist-on ring <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is twisted so as to cause standoffs <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> to enter the smaller ends of keyhole apertures <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. From this position standoffs <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> may not easily be removed from keyhole apertures <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, and the components of inner trim ring <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, in addition to cover <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, are securely attached to extension tube <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and ceiling <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The removal of twist-on ring <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> requires only that the direction of the twist applied to ring <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> be reversed from that in the foregoing description. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Gasket <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> may be similar to gasket <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> located inside collar <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and described in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, although the invention does not require that this be the case. Filter <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> softens the light entering skylight system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and may reduce harsh, concentrated light or glare. Filter <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> may be constructed of an acrylic material, and may conventionally be cut into a shape that matches that of inner trim ring <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Cover <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may also be adapted to soften or diffuse the light entering structure <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, cover <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, which may be formed of an acrylic substance, is composed of a series of alternating ridges and depressions that scatter or distort any light passing through it. The effect of this diffusion may be to illuminate a larger area than would otherwise be possible, with an indirect light that lacks the displeasing effect of a more intense or focused beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The foregoing paragraphs have thus described a skylight system including a light-admitting cap adapted to fit over a grooved flashing. The grooves are constructed in such a way that they will not admit the passage of unwanted objects, such as dust or bugs, and they are placed in the flashing rather than the cap so as to allow the cap&apos;s form to be less obtrusive than would otherwise be possible. The flashing is formed of a single piece of material, which may be aluminum, to reduce the likelihood of warping, or of cracks forming therein. The system further includes an extension tube communicating between the structure&apos;s exterior and a desired location inside the structure, and an inner trim ring with a filter and a diffuser adapted to moderate the intensity of the admitted light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> As has been pointed out at various places within the foregoing, while the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to certain embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, it will be understood that although the shape of various components of the invention have been described in terms identifying them as circular, other shapes are also acceptable and within the invention&apos;s scope. Likewise, the omission or inclusion of, or a change made to, one or another component or feature of the invention will not take the resulting embodiment outside of the scope of the invention, except as limited by the appended claims. </paragraph>
