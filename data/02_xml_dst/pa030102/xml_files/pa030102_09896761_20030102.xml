<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A method and apparatus for enhancing the effective dynamic range of an RF-to-optical-to-RF link. The transmission through an optical link of RF digital signals having magnitudes outside of the dynamic range of the link is performed by changing the amplitude of (e.g., attenuating) such signals prior to transmission, and restoring such signals to their original amplitude after transmission. Signal-to-Noise Ratio (e.g., Noise Power Ratio (NPR)) of such digital signals is thereby maintained above a predetermined minimum level. The method and apparatus have advantageous applications in bi-directional commercial CATV systems. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Technical Field </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to transmission of RF digital signals through an optical link having a limited physical Dynamic Range, particularly a method and apparatus for enhancing the effective Dynamic Range of the link by sacrificing unneeded Signal to Noise Ratio, (e.g., Noise Power Ratio (NPR)) of such digital signals, the method and apparatus having advantageous applications in bi-directional commercial CATV systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Commercial terrestrial Cable Television (CATV) systems now typically utilize optical links (e.g., fiber-optic cable, with RF transmitter-receiver pairs) to carry radio frequency (RF) digital signals over long distances. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> depicts a typical RF digital signal transmission system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the related art. The related art system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes an electro-optical transmitter (Tx, <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>) that transmits the digital information signals (e.g., carried in as RF digital electrical signals RFin) through an Optical-Out port (<highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>) into an optical LINK (<highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>) as light signals to the Optical-In port (<highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>) of an opto-electric Receiver (Rx,<highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>) which outputs the received light signals as radio frequency (RF) digital signals (i.e., RF digital electrical signals RFout). The light signals passed through the optical link <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> (e.g., fiber optic cable) may be Wavelength-Division Multiplexed (WDM) signals. The RF digital electrical signals RFout output from the receiver <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> are generally reproductions of the original electrical signals RFin input to the transmitter <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> except for any gain/attenuation, noise and/or distortion introduced during passage through the system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. A conductor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> carries the radio frequency (RF) electronic signals RFin into the transmitter <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The transmitter <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> may include a laser for transmitting the RF signals as light signals. A conductor <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> carries the radio frequency (RF) electronic signals RFout out of the receiver <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. The transmitter <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> are generally electrically isolated, and separated by significant distances (e.g., several miles). A separate local power supply (not shown in the diagrams) supplies electrical power to each of the transmitter <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the receiver <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The extent to which a digital signal within RFin has been distorted or combined with noise is characterized by persons skilled in the art by known measurements (or calculations) referred to as Signal-To-Noise Ratio (SNR) and/or Noise Power Ratio (NPR). For purposes of discussion and illustration herein, NPR will be considered to be the same and/or analogous to SNR, except that distinct values of NPR (as measured between RFin and RFout) will be associated with &ldquo;amplitudes&rdquo; (e.g., RF power levels) of digital signals input to the system, rather than associated with particular continuous wave (CW) signals. Digital signals (RFin) transmitted out at amplitudes having an NPR equal to or greater than a predetermined minimum NPR (e.g., the current Industry Standard minimum NPR is 40) are considered to have acceptable fidelity, while signals (RFin) transmitted out at amplitudes having an NPR less than the predetermined minimum NPR (e.g., 40) are deemed unacceptably distorted and/or noisy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In a typical digital signal transmission system of the related art, such as system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the Noise Power Ratio (NPR) associated with digital signals (RFout) passing out of the system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be characterized as a function of the amplitude (i.e., signal strength measured in dBmV) of the inputted signals (RFin). Digital signals RFin that have insufficient amplitude (i.e., having amplitude smaller than the smallest amplitude that will emerge from the system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> with an NPR equal to or greater than the predetermined minimum NPR) will emerge too noisy or distorted (i.e., with a SNR that is too small and/or with a NPR less than 40). Digital signals RFin that have a large amplitude can be clipped (i.e., by the Tx, Link, or Rx) to an extent roughly proportional to their amplitude, thus introducing noise and/or distortion. Thus, digital signals RFin that have an amplitude greater than a maximum amplitude (that depends on system device characteristics), can emerge too noisy or distorted (i.e., a SNR and/or NPR that is less than 40). The range of signal amplitudes that includes amplitudes that are not too small, nor too large, and that will emerge from the system with an NPR equal to or higher than the predetermined minimum NPR, is referred to as the &ldquo;dynamic range.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference> is a sketch depicting measured NPR (measured between RFin and RFout) graphed as a function of the amplitude of input signals (RFin), through the typical digital signal transmission system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>. The dynamic range of the system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is characterized by the range of amplitudes (i.e., 10 dBmV to 40 dBmV) of input signals RFin that emerge from the system at NPRs equal to or greater than the predetermined minimum NPR (i.e., 40). As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A, it is typical in a system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the related art that some signals having amplitudes within the dynamic range of the system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, will be transmitted through the system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> associated with NPR values that substantially exceed the predetermined minimum NPR. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A digital signal transmission system having maximally wide dynamic range, and particularly a system that does not introduce significant gain nor attenuation to power level of the outputted RF signal RFout relative to the input RFin, is desirable. However, conventional techniques for increasing the dynamic range of such a system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> generally entail providing more-expensive system components (e.g., a higher fidelity transmitter Tx and/or receiver Rx) and/or higher quality (i.e, more expensive) optical LINK (<highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>) media etc. The expense of such physical upgrades is often economically prohibitive. But, the limited dynamic range of an economical installed terrestrial system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can limit the usefulness, expandability, and performance of such a system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> There is thus a need for a method for transmitting RF signals through an optical link, and an economical RF digital signal transmission system, that provide an enhanced (i.e., wider) effective dynamic range. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The present invention overcomes physical and economic limitations on the dynamic range of a RF digital signal transmission system that includes an optical link. The disclosed invention is applicable to the entire cable television (CATV) frequency range, and may be especially useful in lower frequency CATV applications such as transmission of end-user supplied information, such as programming and/or website section information, from the set-top box back to the commercial CATV provider. RF digital signals that may be transmitted through the inventive RF digital signal transmission system may include QAM (e.g., M-ary Quadrature Amplitude Modulated), Baseband, QPSK and other types. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The present invention exploits the knowledge that in a typical RF digital signal transmission system, such as system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A, it is typical that some range of amplitudes (of RFin signals) within the dynamic range of the system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, will be transmitted with NPR values that substantially exceed the predetermined minimum NPR. In other words, some amplitudes (of RFin signals) will produce output signals (RFout) that have more SNR and/or NPR than is needed for faithful transmission of encoded information. The present invention further exploits a discovery that such &ldquo;excess performance&rdquo; (i.e., higher than necessary NPR) of a typical system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can be purposefully sacrificed with the result of effectively enhancing (widening) the dynamic range of such a system (i.e., without improving the quality of the optical LINK (<highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>) nor improving the fidelity of either the transmitter (Tx) or the Receiver (Rx)). </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a block diagram depicting a RF digital signal transmission system for transmission of informational signals (i.e. informational signals carried into the system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> as RF electronic signals RFin, and out of the system as RF electronic signals RFout) through an optical link <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, and supporting an enhanced dynamic range, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. The system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> includes an external conductor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> for carrying in radio frequency (RF) digital information signals as electronic signals RFin. The system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> also includes an external conductor <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> for carrying out the radio frequency (RF) digital informational signals as electronic signals RFout. Embodiments of the system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may further include an intact RF transmitter-LINK-receiver system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the related art. Alternatively, the active components (e.g., <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>) of the related art system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be modified so as to be physically and electrically integrated with additional components (e.g., <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> respectively) that are unique to the inventive system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the system further comprises a first RF Level Transforming circuit <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, adapted to sense (i.e., measure, integrate, or compute) the average power level (i.e., amplitude) of the electronic signals (RFin) entering the system during a predetermined (or during a dynamically variable) period of time (e.g., ranging from one second to several minutes), and to accordingly transform (i.e, amplify or attenuate) the level of such inputted electronic signals (before they are transmitted by the transmitter <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> through the link <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>), in such a manner as to enhance the effective dynamic range of the included system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> so that it is wider than the physical dynamic range of the included transmitter-link-receiver system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The active components (e.g., <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>) unique to the system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, (which will be more particularly described below) are adapted to perform a method for enhancing the effective dynamic range of a system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> including a transmitter <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, an optical link <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, and a receiver <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. The method performed by the system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> comprises: measuring during a period of time the original signal power level (i.e., amplitude) of RF electronic signals (RFin), wherein the RF electronic signals are to be transmitted as light signals by a transmitter <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> through an optical link <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> to a receiver that outputs the light signals as RF electronic signals; transforming (e.g., attenuating) the amplitude of such RF electronic signals to a transformed (e.g, attenuated amplitude) level before the RF electronic signals are transmitted as light signals by the transmitter <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, whereby the noise power ratio (PR) of the transmitted RF electronic signals is greater than it would be if such attenuation had not been performed. The will generally also include a second transformation of the signals after the passing through the receiver <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, such that the RF signals RFout output from the system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> shall have approximately the original signal power level (i.e., amplitude). Thus, the second transformation at the output end (e.g., at <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>) of the system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> will perform the inverse transformation (mirror) as was performed at the input end (e.g., at <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> As an example, in the case of the exemplary NPR function (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference>) for the transmitter-link-receiver system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> included within system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, it may be observed that a signal having amplitude 50 dBmV will pass through the system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> with an associated NPR of less than 40 (i.e., inadequate), while a signal having the smaller amplitude 30 dBmV will pass through the system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> with an associated NPR of approximately 50. Thus, if the 50 dBmV signal were transformed (e.g., attenuated) down to 30 dBmV before passing through the system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the emerging attenuated signal would theoretically be associated with an NPR of nearly 50 (e.g., the peak NPR value, at 30 bBmV). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a sketch depicting exemplary NPR graphed as a function of the power level (i.e., amplitude) of input signals (RFin), through the digital signal transmission system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> further depicts how the ENHANCED DYNAMIC RANGE of system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may be compared with the &ldquo;original dynamic range&rdquo; of the included system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> (which was first depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference>). In practice, the process of attenuating the 50 dBmV of signals might to some extent introduce distortion and/or noise into the RF electronic signal, resulting in some reduction of the final NPR for the outputted signals. However, the 10 NPR-unit margin of &ldquo;excess performance&rdquo; (i.e., 50&minus;40&equals;10) (i.e., computed at the attenuated-to amplitude of 30 bBmV by subtracting the actual NMR value 50 from the predetermined minimum value 40) can be exploited to output RF signals from the system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> with an NPR of at least 40 (e.g., about 45 as shown in the sketch of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). Thus, by sacrificing the &ldquo;excess&rdquo; NPR, RF signals of amplitudes that would ordinarily not pass through the system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> with sufficient NPR (i.e., signals of amplitudes beyond the physical dynamic range of the system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) can be transformed (e.g., attenuated) and then passed though the system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> with the requisite NPR (i.e., equal to or greater than 40). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> A pre-transmission attenuation scheme could be advantageously practiced (within limits imposed by the fidelity of real attenuating circuits) with signals of any amplitude greater than the top of the dynamic range (e.g., greater than 40 dBmV) of the system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, NPR values equal to or greater than 40 could be accorded to signals of amplitudes beyond (i.e., greater than) the dynamic range (e.g., greater than 40 dBmV) of the system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, thus effectively extending the upper limits of the effective dynamic range of the system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> beyond the original dynamic range of system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> (as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Attenuation of electronic RF signals (RFin) of amplitudes beyond the dynamic range of the included system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> could be carried out by many schemes and many circuits known to persons skilled in the art. For example the first RF Level Transforming circuit <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> might be designed such that all signals having amplitudes greater than a certain predetermined number of dBmV (e.g., greater than 35 dBmV) shall be selectively attenuated. Selective attenuation can be facilitated by some type of RF power level sensor, within the system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> (e.g., within the first RF Level Transforming circuit <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>) to detect the average RF power level of the RF signals passing through the system at that point in time and to generate a control signal to continuously control or intermittently trigger the attenuation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> is a block diagram depicting the internal components of a first embodiment of the first RF Level Transforming circuit of system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The first RF Level Transforming circuit <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> includes at least an RF attenuator <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> adapted to attenuate RF power levels (amplitudes) of electronic signals (RFin) passed to the system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The first RF Level Transforming circuit <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> may further include RF level sensor <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight>. RF level sensor <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> could be an explicit component of the system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> extrinsic to the RF attenuator <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>) or the RF power level sensing function could be performed as an implicit function of embodiments of an RF attenuator <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> itself. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> A discrete RF level sensor <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> could be operated as a digital switch enabling the RF attenuator <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> when the RF power level (i.e., amplitude) of RFin exceeds (and/or falls below) a predetermined threshold amount. Accordingly, a selective attenuation scheme might be implemented as a uniform attenuation scheme, such as where a constant (e.g., 10 dBmV) attenuation is applied to all signals of amplitudes greater than the predetermined of dBmV. The effect of such a selective but uniform attenuation scheme would likely extend the dynamic range upward by an amount approximately equal to the magnitude of the uniform attenuation. Such a &ldquo;uniform attenuation scheme&rdquo; need not be perfectly uniform over a range of RF power levels of RFin, nor even predictable (i.e., the amount of transformation of amplitude of signals RFin coming into the system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> at a particular RF power level need not be predictable nor deterministic at any point in time), as long as the transformation (i.e., amplification/attenuation) scheme can be mirrored and/or the transformation counteracted in real time by equipment provided at the receiver end of the system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The attenuation of the RF power level may also be linear and/or deterministic, e.g., proportional to the RF power level at conductor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. The RF sensor could produce a control signal that is proportional or approximately proportional to the RF power level. The RF attenuator <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> may be or operate like potentiometer controlled by the control signal, so as to increase the attenuation approximately in proportion to an increase in RF power level. The RF attenuator <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> may be implemented with a PIN diode (e.g., a PIN diode forward biased by a current controlled by the RF sensor). Alternatively, various linear and nonlinear attenuation schemes could be implemented within the circuit <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, whereby the dynamic range of the system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> could be extended above the upper limits of the dynamic range of system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the RF level sensor <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> could be operated as an analogue sensor that continuously controls the magnitude of the attenuation performed by RF attenuator <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> so as to (proportionally, linearly, or otherwise deterministicly, or non-deterministicly) increase the attenuation (i.e., reduce the amplitude of the high RF level signal passing to system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) as the RF power level of RFin increases towards or above the top of the dynamic range of system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> is a block diagram depicting the internal components of a second embodiment of the first RF Level Transforming circuit <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> in system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. In alternative embodiments of the invention, the first RF Level Transforming circuit <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> may further include an RF amplifier <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> adapted to amplify RF power levels (amplitudes) of electronic signals (RFin) passed to the system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The RF amplifier <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> could be used to amplify the RFin signal at times when the RF power level (i.e., amplitude) of signals RFin is below the lower bounds of the dynamic range of the system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, so as to extend the dynamic range of the system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> lower than the lower bound of the dynamic range of system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). The RF level sensor <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> could be adapted to control the operation of the RF amplifier <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight>, in an inverse manner as it is used to control the operation of the RF attenuator <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight>. In typical embodiments, only one of the RF amplifier <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> and RF attenuator <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> will be substantially active at any given point in time (i.e. typically, the RF attenuator <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> will not significantly affect the amplitude of the signals while the RF amplifier <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> is active, and vice versa, and various schemes for avoiding contention between the RF attenuator <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> and the RF amplifier <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> are know to persons skilled in the art. In some embodiments of the invention, a single circuit component may perform the functions of both the RF attenuator <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> and the RF amplifier <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight>, alternating between such functions depending upon the output of the RF level sensor <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight>). Providing an RF amplifier within the first RF Level Transforming circuit <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> facilitates the downward enhancement of the dynamic range of system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to below the lower limit of the dynamic range of system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a sketch depicting enhanced dynamic range of embodiments of system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> that include Amplifier <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> graphed as a function of the amplitude of RF input signals, through the digital signal transmission system of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The enhanced dynamic range of the system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is extended below the dynamic range of system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> by amplifying RF signals (RFin) having amplitudes below the dynamic range of system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a block diagram depicting the internal components of the optional second RF Level Transforming circuit <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> in system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. In some embodiments of the invention, the system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may comprise an (optional) second RF Level Transforming circuit <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> adapted to reverse the transformation (i.e., to provide amplification to exactly counteract a signal attenuation performed by the first RF Level Transforming circuit <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>; or to provide attenuation to counteract an amplification performed by the first RF Level Transforming circuit <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>). The second RF Level Transforming circuit <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> can mirror the first RF Level Transforming circuit <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> and adjust its Amplification/Attenuation so as to maintain (at RFout) the same RF power level (i.e., amplitude) as was input to the system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> (at RFin). The result of this is to enhance the dynamic range of the system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> while also providing RFout at the original RF power level (i.e., amplitude) as was originally received at RFin. The second RF Level Transforming circuit <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> may be particularly useful in CATV systems wherein Automatic Gain Controllers (AGCs) are present, to avoid contention of the system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> with such AGCs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In embodiments of the invention where the second RF Level Transforming circuit <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> is supplied for maintaining the RF power level at RFout, it is desirable that a continuous communication exists between the first RF Level Transforming circuit <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> and the second RF Level Transforming circuit <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>. The RF level sensor <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> may be adapted to output a signal that indicates the power level of RFin and which can be converted to an RF signal encoding that power level information which can be injected into the system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and then transmitted through the optical link (<highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) to a RF decoder <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> in (or operatively coupled to) the second RF Level Transforming circuit <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>. The RF decoder <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> will decode the RF signal encoding that power level information, and supply that information to control the RF Amplifier <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> and/or RF Attenuator <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight> within the second RF Level Transforming circuit <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, so as to maintain the power level (i.e., amplitude) of RFout the same as the power level of RFin. The RFout signals will generally be faithful reproductions of the original digital signals (RFin) without significant changes in amplitude (i.e. no great net gain nor attenuation) except for any noise and/or distortion introduced during passage through the system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Generally, the amplitude (i.e., RF power level) of the RF digital signals (RFout) emerging from the system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> will be approximately the same as the RF power level of the same digital signals (RFin) when they entered the system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Typically, the RF power level (i.e., amplitude) of the emergent RFout signals will be within plus or minus one-half decibels (&plusmn;0.5 dB) of the RF power level of RFin. Embodiments of the system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may be also be designed so that the RF power level (i.e., amplitude) of the emergent RFout signals will be within plus or minus one-quarter decibels (&plusmn;0.25 dB) of the RF power level of RFin, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Alternative embodiments of the invention may be implemented by adapting the circuits disclosed in commonly assigned co-pending US patent application No. ______, filed ______ 2001, (titled, RF LEVEL STABILIZATION OF OPTICAL LINK OVER TEMPERATURE) and incorporated herein by reference. For example, the &ldquo;RF sensor&rdquo; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference> of the co-pending application may be adapted to perform the functions of sensor <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> herein, and be operatively connected to the RF Amplifier and RF Attenuator circuits depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> of the co-pending application, to enable those circuits to perform the methods of the present invention (i.e., to enhance the dynamic range of the transmitter-optical link-receiver system <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>) included in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference> of the co-pending application. The RF power level measured by an RF power level sensor may be encoded (e.g., by modulator <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) and transmitted through the optical link to control the RF Amplifier and RF Attenuator at the RF output end of the system. The RF Level Stabilization circuits of the co-pending are well adapted to implement the method of the present invention, wherein the RF power level (i.e., amplitude) supplied to the transmitter (e.g., &ldquo;laser&rdquo; <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>) is maintained at a constant RF level. Optimally, the constant RF level would be at or near the &ldquo;peak&rdquo; of the NPR curve of the transmitter-optical link-receiver system. The selection of the RF level at or near the &ldquo;peak&rdquo;of the NPR curve would tend to maximize the dynamic range of the constant-level RF digital signal transmission system disclosed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> of the co-pending application. </paragraph>
