<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a speed retarder which cooperates with a shaft. In particular, the invention is directed to a hydrodynamic braking system. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Service brakes provided on trucks and buses often overheat or fade when the vehicles are subject to extreme conditions, such as long descents. As a consequence, numerous braking systems have been developed to assist braking of these vehicles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> One of the more recognizable systems is referred to as &ldquo;Jake Brakes&rdquo; manufactured by the Jacobs Manufacturing Company. As is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,572,114, the Jacob&apos;s brake is a compression release engine retarder which temporarily disables the normal operation of the engine and converts the standard engine into an air compressor for developing a retarding horsepower. This type of engine retarder has several drawbacks. The compression release brake, and similar systems interfaced with the engine, produce a force which is limited by the size and rpm capability of the engine. These brakes can only provide the needed amount of retardation force over long and/or steep grades with the vehicle at a relatively slow speed and with the compression release brake operated at a high engine r.p.m. Once engaged, it is difficult and can be hazardous to shift into a lower gear. Also, if the engine is shut down, the engine retarder does not function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Another system, the hydraulic retarder, has a larger power capability and is easy to control. However, dissipation of the braking energy is commonly done through the vehicle&apos;s own cooling system. This severely limits the retarder performance, complicates the installation, and makes these systems more expensive than the compression release system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Yet another system, the electrical brake system, though providing a noticeable braking addition, has become unpopular due to cost, weight, fade, and inertia factors, especially on the larger on-highway trucks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Another vehicle braking system which is not interfaced with the engine is disclosed in Bultmann, U.S. Pat. No. 4,114,734. The Bultmann device has two oppositely rotating and opposing rotors coupled directly to the drive shaft of a vehicle. The Bultmann device requires a separate cooling system to dissipate the heat generated by the rotors. However, the system disclosed is not capable of producing a constant or operator regulated retardant force. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It would, therefore, be advantageous to provide a vehicle retardation system which does not rely on the operation of the engine and which produces a reliable retardant force in any type of conditions. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The invention is directed to a speed retarding system. The system has a housing with a chamber provided therein. A shaft receiving sleeve extends through the housing and the chamber. A wheel is provided in the chamber and extends from the shaft receiving sleeve to an outer circumferential wall of the housing. The wheel has a plurality of blades provided thereon, at least some of the blades extend from the shaft receiving sleeve toward the outer circumferential wall in a generally arcuate configuration. The arcuate configuration of the blades facilitate the pumping action of a liquid which flows through the wheel only when the system is in a free moving state and enhances the retardation of movement of the wheel when the system is in a braking state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A ring is provided about an outer circumference of the wheel. The ring is integrally attached to the blades. Whereby as movement of liquid provided in the system is restricted, the relative positioning of blades is maintained by the ring even as heat is accumulated by the system.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> A brake or retarder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> according to the invention has a rotor wheel <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> coupled to a drive shaft extension <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The rotor wheel <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and drive shaft extension <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are coupled such that rotation of either the rotor wheel or drive shaft will cause the rotation of the other. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the rotor wheel <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is provided in a distribution chamber <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> in housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The distribution chamber <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> has a generally circular cross-sectional configuration with an outside wall <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> positioned about the circumference. Passageways or openings <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> extend through the outside wall <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and connect the distribution chamber <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to one or more outlet channels <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. An inlet channel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> also extends into distribution chamber <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is made from metal or other material having the desired strength and heat dissipation characteristics required. The exterior surface of the housing may have fins or protrusions which extends therefrom to increase the service area thereof to facilitate in the dissipation of heat. In the embodiment shown, the housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has two halves which are joined and held together by screws or other conventional fastening members. An opening <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is provided in the housing and is dimensioned to receive the drive shaft extension <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> therein. The opening extends through a first side surface <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and a second side surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the rotor wheel <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> has a plurality of blades <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which extend from proximate an inner drive shaft extension retainer sleeve <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to a stay ring <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> provided at the outer circumference of the rotor wheel <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The number of blades <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may vary according to the application. As shown in the figure, alternating blades extend to and engage the sleeve <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. However various configurations all possible within the scope of the invention, e.g. all blades may extend to and engage the sleeve. In the embodiment shown, the blades <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are essentially identical in configuration and are uniformly spaced from each other. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the blades extend radially from the sleeve <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in an arcuate or curve configuration. The curved configuration of the blades <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> adds to the effectiveness of the retarder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, as will be more fully described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the height h<highlight><subscript>c </subscript></highlight>of each blade <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> proximate the center is less than the height h<highlight><subscript>o </subscript></highlight>of the blade <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> proximate the outer circumference of the rotor wheel <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The stay ring <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is attached to the outer ends <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the blades <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The configuration of the stay ring <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may vary, but the height h<highlight><subscript>s </subscript></highlight>of the stay ring should be minimized so as not to affect the flow of the liquid (as will be more fully described below). As shown in the figure, the configuration of the blades <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> generally conforms to the shape of distribution chamber <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The blades <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are dimensioned to be proximate the interior walls of the chamber <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, but are dimensioned to not engage the walls, thereby allowing the rotor wheel <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to turn freely in the chamber <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The outer wall <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of chamber <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> has cavities <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> provided therein. The cavities <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are spaced apart and separated by cavity walls <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The cavities <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> extend essentially the entire height of the outside walls <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Passageways <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are periodically positioned in respective cavities <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The number and dimensions of the cavities <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may vary according to particular application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The outlet channels <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> extend through the housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and connect to a distribution system <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> through a flow control opening <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) which enables the liquid or oil to be moved within a closed system (as will be more fully discussed). A valve <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is provided proximate the outlet channels and cooperates with the flow control opening <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> to control the flow of liquid therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is one component of the retarder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Other components include a fan <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> for cooling the liquid and a reservoir <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> for storing and cooling the liquid. A pump may be provided to facilitate the movement of the liquid; however, in most applications, a pump is not required. As the fan <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, pump, and reservoir <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> are conventional parts and as they have been used in prior art hydraulic brakes systems, detailed explanation of these components will not be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In use, the operator of a truck or other vehicle applies pressure to a gas pedal <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, causing the engine to generate the power required to move the vehicle. As the gas pedal is depressed, the valve <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is moved away from the flow control opening <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, allowing the liquid to move freely within the distribution system <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The valve <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is controlled by an actuating lever <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> which cooperates with a cam surface <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. When the gas pedal is fully engaged, the actuating lever <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> cooperates with the arcuate surface <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> of the cam surface <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, thereby causing the valve <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to be moved out of the flow control opening <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. In other words, as the drive shaft is turned, the blades <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are caused to rotate within the chamber <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. This rotation of the rotor wheel <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and blades acts as a pump, causing the liquid to be pumped through the inlet channel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, across blades <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, through cavities <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and outlet channels <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and exiting through flow control opening <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> into the system <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. As the valve <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> does not prohibit or inhibit the flow of the liquid, the liquid may move without restriction, such that no opposed force is applied to the rotor wheel. The drive shaft extension <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the drive shaft are free to rotate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In contrast, when the operator desires to slow down, he releases his foot from the gas pedal causing the actuating lever <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> to engage an angled portion <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> of the cam surface <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. The engagement of the actuating lever <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> with the angled portion <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> causes the valve <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to be moved into the flow control opening <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. The movement of the valve <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> into the opening <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is known in the art and will not be described in detail. Generally, the movement of the valve into the opening <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> only occurs when the gas pedal is almost completely disengaged. However, the movement of the valve relative to the gas pedal can be controlled to provide the desired results for the application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> With the valve <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> completely positioned in opening <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, the flow of the liquid beyond the valve <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is prevented. However, as the drive shaft continues to rotate, the blades <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the rotor wheel <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> also continue to rotate and continues to act as pump for the liquid. As the liquid is prevented from moving beyond valve <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, the liquid backs up into the outlet channels, the cavities <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and chamber <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. As this occurs, the reservoir of liquid in the cavities <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and chamber <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> inhibits the free movement of the blades <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, thereby causing the speed of the rotation of the blades to be slowed. As the blades <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the rotor wheel <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> encounter resistance, the rotor wheel is slowed, and so is the drive shaft extension <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and drive shaft coupled thereto. This results in the braking or retardation of the speed of the vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> While systems with some similarities to that described have been used before, they have proven ineffective, as the systems have not provided the immediate braking forces required or the consistent braking forces required over long distances. The invention described herein does not have the same problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The blades <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the present invention have an arcuate configuration to allow the middle portion of the blades to act as a suction cup. This allows the flow of liquid to be greatly increased over the conventional straight bladed wheels. This is a significant advantage, as the increased flow of material allows the braking or speed retardation of the drive shaft and vehicle to occur much more quickly. Therefore, the effectiveness of the retarder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the present invention is greatly enhanced. This pumping action is further facilitated by the dimensioning of the blades <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Each blade is manufactured to have a close tolerance with the inner walls of the chamber <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The tight dimensions ensure that the flow of liquid will be through the blades, rather than around the blades. No pockets of stagnant liquid will be provided in the chamber when the valve is in the open position, thereby providing optimum pumping capability. Additionally, as all of the blades do not engage the sleeve <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, more liquid will be introduced into the wheel more quickly. Consequently, the pumping action is enhanced and the activation time is reduced adding to the effectiveness and reliability of the retarder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The shape of the blades <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, with the height h<highlight><subscript>c </subscript></highlight>less than the height h<highlight><subscript>o</subscript></highlight>, also contributes to the pumping action. As the liquid enters the chamber <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> through the inlet channel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the liquid is moved quickly to the outer circumference of the wheel <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. This movement is facilitated by the configuration of the blades <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In addition, the shape of the blades <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> contributes to the braking ability of the system. The blades have greater surface area provided at the outer circumference of the wheel <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> proximate the cavities <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Therefore, as the fluid backs into the chamber <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the large surface area at the outer circumference of the wheel <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> will cooperate with the liquid to quickly and effectively slow the wheel <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the drive shaft. This effect is increased due to the positioning of the cavities <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The increased surface area at the outer circumference of the blades <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> causes maximum turbulence with the liquid provided in the cavities <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, thereby enhancing the braking capability of the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The stability of the wheel <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and blades <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are important to the reliability of the system as the speed retardation occurs. As the liquid backs up into the chamber and as the movement of the wheel and shaft are retarded, significant heat builds up in the fluid and wheel. In the prior art, heat causes the positional stability of the blades to degrade. Consequently, as the heat builds, the blades move relative to each other causing the effectiveness and reliability of the retarder to diminish. In contrast, the present invention maintains the positional stability of the blades during all conditions. The use of the stay ring <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> insures that the blades <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> will be maintained in position. As the stay ring is integrally attached to the blades at the outer circumference, each individual blade cannot move relative to the other blades in extreme conditions. Therefore, as the liquid and components are heated, the reliability and effectiveness of the retarder is not degraded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, the stay ring <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is positioned to maintain the integrity of the wheel <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. However, as the liquid must freely flow through the blades <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> when the valve <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is in the open position, the dimensions of the stay ring <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> must be minimized so that the ring does not act as a restriction which slows the flow of the liquid. In particular, the height of the stay ring must be minimized. Therefore, while various configurations of the stay ring are possible, the height of the stay ring must be properly controlled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The use of the retarder or brake has been described with reference to a truck having significant weight. However, the system described herein can be used for any vehicle having a drive shaft. In addition, this retarder can also be used as a safety device for elevators and the like. The retarder can be attached to the shaft of the elevator so that in the case of a failure, the retarder will slow and control the fall of the elevator, reducing the chance of significant injury. As the retarder of the present invention does not require the use of a functioning motor to perform, the use of the retarder can be used in many additional applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The foregoing illustrates some of the possibilities for practicing the invention. Many other embodiments are possible within the scope and spirit of the invention. It is, therefore, intended that the foregoing description be regarded as illustrative rather than limiting, and that the scope of the invention is given by the appended claims together with their full range of equivalents. </paragraph>
