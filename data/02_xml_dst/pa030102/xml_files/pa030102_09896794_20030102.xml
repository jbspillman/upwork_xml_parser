<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention generally pertains to providing user-requested content over a network, and more specifically, to providing user-requested content through an alternate network service when a preferred network service is unavailable to provide it. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Networks, including the Internet, are widely used by many users for a variety of purposes. For example, network services on the Internet may be accessed throughout the world for information retrieval, e-commerce, etc. In addition, the Internet has a virtually unlimited number of users accessing various network services thereon at any given time. Indeed, these network services are typically available year-round, twenty-four hours each day for seven days each week. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The resources (i.e., hardware and software) used to provide these services over the network, however, have a finite capacity that is determined by the resources allocated to the network service. That is, a particular network service (e.g., an Internet site) can only handle a finite number of requests for access thereto. However, network services frequently experience a surge in demand that approaches or exceeds the finite capacity of the resources allocated to the network service. When the demand approaches or exceeds the capacity of the resources allocated to the network service, the users may experience severely degraded performance of the network service. For example, a network service may be equipped to accommodate at most fifty users at any given time. Thus, when more than fifty users are accessing the network service, the performance of the network service declines for each user accessing the network service. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> One solution is to turn away, or refuse to serve, additional users that exceed the capacity of the network service. For example, a network service equipped to accommodate fifty users may refuse to serve any additional users (e.g., the fifty-first user). As such, the performance of the network service is maintained for the initial fifty users. However, the users that are turned away from the network service often never return, and instead find and return to other network services. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Another solution is to increase the capacity of the resources (e.g., by adding more servers, etc., than is estimated to be necessary for normal operating conditions). However, over-allocating resources can be costly and unnecessary. Many small or start-up companies may not be able to afford additional resources until, for example, sales volume increases. In addition, network services are subject to wide fluctuations in demand. User demand depends on a variety of factors, such as, the number of users, the time of day, etc. In addition, traffic to a particular network service can start out slow and due to advertising, linking, etc., grow exponentially in a short period of time. The timing of such increases in demand is often difficult to predict, making it difficult to anticipate or plan the resource capacity that is necessary to meet future demand. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The inventors have devised an apparatus and method for providing user-requested content over a network (e.g., the Internet) through an alternate network service when a preferred network service is unavailable. For example, a user may access a preferred network service that is experiencing demand that exceeds the capacity of the resources allocated thereto, and is therefore unavailable. Instead of allowing the user to access the preferred network service, and thus degrade the performance of the preferred network service, or instead of refusing service to the user altogether, according to embodiments of the invention, the user is provided with the same content, or substantially similar content, through an alternate network service. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The apparatus is preferably embodied in computer readable program code stored on the computer readable storage media. For example, the computer readable program code may reside at least in part at the preferred network service. Or for example, the computer readable program code may reside at least in part at a user workstation, as a software application, as an Internet browser &ldquo;plug-in&rdquo; module, etc. Or in yet another example, the computer readable program code may be separately stored and accessed from the user workstation and/or from the preferred network service at least in part over the network (e.g., at a separate network service itself). The computer readable program code may comprise: program code for assessing the availability of the user-requested content from the preferred network service; program code for selecting an alternate network service providing the same content, or substantially similar content, as the user-requested content; and program code for linking to the alternate network service when the user-requested content is unavailable from the preferred network service. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Preferably, providing the user-requested content from the alternate network service is transparent to the user. That is, the user may be linked to the preferred network service (e.g., to the front-end service thereof), but the user-requested content may be provided via the alternate network service (e.g., via a back-end service at the alternate network service). According to this embodiment, a suitable protocol translation layer may be provided for communicating with the back-end service at the alternate network service and providing the user-requested content transparently to the user. As an example, an e-commerce site may be equipped to process payment information and provide the user with a confirmation of payment. However, when the e-commerce site is busy processing the payment information for other users, or is otherwise unavailable for processing the user&apos;s payment (e.g., the back-end service at the preferred network service is down), according to an embodiment of the invention, the user&apos;s payment information is transferred to an alternate network service (e.g., the back-end service thereof) for processing. As such, the user&apos;s payment information is processed, however, the user is unaware that the payment was processed at the alternate network service, as the user was not redirected or otherwise directly linked thereto. As another example, the user may link to a preferred search service, and where the preferred back-end service is unavailable to perform the search, the search is performed using the back-end service of another search service. The results are preferably presented to the user via the front-end service of the preferred network service (e.g., via the same interface and in the same format had the search been performed at the preferred network service). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the user may be linked through an intermediary network service. That is, the user first links to the intermediary network service, and then links to other network services via the intermediary network service. The user-requested content may be provided from the alternate network service, transparently to the user, or the user may be linked to the alternate network service. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The apparatus also preferably comprises program code for monitoring the network and for identifying one or more alternate network services to provide content that is the same as, or substantially similar to, the user-requested requested content. Program code is also preferably provided for assessing the availability of the alternate network service. In addition, program code is preferably provided for profiling the availability of the user-requested content on the preferred network service and/or the alternate network service. The profile may comprise, for example, the frequency of transfers, the identity of the alternate network service(s), etc. The profile may be used for strategic alliances with other network services, for payment arrangements for the use of the alternate network service(s) that have handled the overflow, for allocating additional resources at the preferred network service, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A method is also disclosed for providing the user-requested content over a network when the user-requested content is unavailable from a preferred network service. The method may comprise: assessing the availability of the preferred network service for providing the user-requested content; selecting an alternate network service also providing the user-requested requested content, or substantially similar content when the preferred network service is unavailable; and linking to the selected alternate network service to provide the user-requested content when the preferred network service is unavailable. Assessing the availability of the preferred network service may comprise comparing a load thereon to a threshold value, wherein the preferred network service is unavailable when the load exceeds the threshold. Preferably, the method also comprises assessing the availability of the alternate network service and linking thereto only when the alternate network service is available. The method may also comprise monitoring the network and identifying at least one alternate network service that provides the same, or substantially the same, content as the preferred network service. Preferably, the method also comprises profiling the preferred network service based on the availability thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> As such, embodiments of the invention provide the user-requested content, or content substantially similar thereto, when the demand approaches or exceeds the capacity of the resources allocated to the preferred network service. The user-requested content is provided without degrading the performance of the preferred network service for users already having access thereto. In addition, the user is not refused service, and the user-requested content, or substantially similar content, is still provided to the user. In addition, resources can be efficiently allocated to the network service, without over-allocating the resources. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> These and other important advantages of the present invention will be further explained in, or will become apparent from, the accompanying description, drawings and claims. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a high-level diagram showing a network <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> over which a user at a workstation <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may link to a preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. That is, the user at the workstation <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> (e.g., using an Internet browser) identifies the preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> (e.g., using a uniform resource locator (URL), an IP address, etc.). A front-end service <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may provide access to the preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> (e.g., via an Internet home page), generally referred to as Function A (<highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>). The user may also request additional content, generally referred to as Function B (<highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>), such as search results, payment processing, etc., that is provided by a back-end service <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>. Also shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is an overflow management tool <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> for providing the user-requested content through one or more alternate network services <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> when the preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is unavailable. For example, the user-requested content, or substantially similar content (e.g., Function C (<highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>) and/or Function D (<highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>)) may be provided to the user from one or more of the alternate network services <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The overflow management tool <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> preferably comprises an overflow database <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>, and may also comprise a translation layer <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight>, where necessary. The overflow management tool <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> may be accessed via the network <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> (e.g., link <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>); directly from the user workstation <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> (e.g., via link <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>); directly from the preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> (e.g., from the services <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> via link <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> and/or link <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>); or any suitable combination thereof, as explained in more detail below with respect to the preferred embodiments of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> As an illustration, the requested content may be an Internet search engine. The user identifies the preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> (e.g., http://www.PreferredSearchSvc.com) for the requested content (i.e., the search engine in this example) on the network <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> using an Internet browser (e.g., NETSCAPE NAVIGATOR&reg;, MICROSOFT INTERNET EXPLORER&reg;, etc.). However, any number of other users may also be accessing the same preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> simultaneously. According to prior approaches, where the load (e.g., number of users, response time, etc.) exceeds the resources allocated to the preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, the user is given access to the search engine, however, performance thereof declines as the number of users accessing the search engine increase above the capacity of the resources allocated thereto (e.g., back-end service <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>). Alternately, and according to prior approaches, the user may be turned away or refused service (i.e., denied access to the search engine). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In the above illustration, and according to the teachings of the invention, the user identifies the preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> for the requested content (e.g., Function A (<highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>) and/or Function B (<highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>)) on the network <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> using the Internet browser. Again, any number of other users may also be accessing the same preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> simultaneously. Therefore, the availability of the preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is assessed. For example, the one or more of the services <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> may be assessed for the availability thereof to provide the requested content or function <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. The preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> may be assessed based on the number of users, the response time, etc. Where the preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is unavailable, instead of providing the user with poor service or denying service to the user altogether, the user-requested content (or substantially similar content) is provided from one or more alternate network services <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> (e.g., Function C <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> or Function D <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>). The user-requested content is preferably provided transparently to the user (e.g., from the back-end service <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> at the alternate network service <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>) via the front-end service <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> of the preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> It is understood that the term &ldquo;workstation&rdquo; as used herein may be any suitable device, now known or later developed, such as but not limited to, a personal computer (PC), a laptop computer, a handheld computer, a wireless device (e.g., an analog or digital phone, Internet appliance), etc. Furthermore, the network <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be any suitable network, including the components thereof (e.g., routers, hubs, etc.). For example, the network <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), an Intranet, the Internet, a wireless phone network, etc., or a combination thereof. Likewise, any suitable link may be established, either directly or indirectly, with the network <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Suitable links may include, but are not limited to, a dial-up modem connection, a digital subscriber line (DSL), T-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> connection, cellular link, infrared link, BLUETOOTH(TM) link, satellite link, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> It is also understood that the preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the alternate network services <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> are preferably Internet sites. However, the network services may be program code operating &ldquo;behind the scenes&rdquo; and are not necessarily directly accessed or linked thereto via a URL as an Internet site itself may be accessed. Indeed, it is understood that the user may be linked to one or more preferred network services <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and/or one or more alternate network services <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> in any suitable manner, including, but not limited to, direct transfer, indirect transfer, via a permanent or semi-permanent connection, via dynamic transfer (e.g., based on the load thereon), etc. For example, a network service may be an encryption routine that operates in the background of a conventional Internet site. As such, the user may be linked to the Internet site, but not directly linked to the encryption routine. Other illustrations are given below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> It is further understood that the preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the alternate network services <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> may be any suitable network services on the corresponding network <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Likewise, it is understood that the front-end services <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> and the back-end services <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> are merely shown as examples. In other embodiments, the services need not be distinct services, may include additional services than those shown, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> A suitable translation layer <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> is preferably provided to translate protocols for access to the functions <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> provided by the various alternate network services <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight>). The translation layer <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> may comprise suitable program code, translation databases, etc. As an example of its use, the translation layer <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> may facilitate communication between the front-end service <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> of the preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the back-end service <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> of the alternate network service(s) <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight>, where necessary. The translation layer <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> may comprise readily available program code and databases, such as those provided by third-party vendors for access to their services (e.g., for payment processing, etc.), or may be specifically coded for use with preferred embodiments of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the overflow management tool <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is embodied in computer readable program code. However, the overflow management tool <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> may also be hardware, firmware, etc., or a combination thereof. In addition, the overflow management tool <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> may be a separate software and/or hardware module, integrated as part of another component (e.g., workstation <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, front-end service <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>), etc. The overflow management tool <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> may be a &ldquo;plug-in&rdquo; module for an Internet browser, a separate application, or an Internet service through which the user operates. In addition, the overflow management tool <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> may reside at the workstation <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, at the preferred site <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> (e.g., at one of the services <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>), at a separate network service, etc. Likewise, the overflow management tool <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> may reside on or be accessed by a separate computer or processor at any one or more physical locations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the user-requested content, or substantially similar content, is provided from one or more of the alternate network services <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> transparently to the user. That is, the user may be linked to the preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, but the user-requested content is provided via one of the alternate network services <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> (e.g., via a back-end service <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> at the alternate network service <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>). This embodiment may be described as follows, with respect to the exemplary interface <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Preferably, the interface <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is a graphical user interface (GUI), such as may be displayed through an Internet browser. For example, when the user connects to the preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, a banner advertisement <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, a navigation menu <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, and other content <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> may be displayed. According to preferred embodiments of the invention, when the preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is unavailable, the user-requested content is provided from one or more alternate network services <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, although the user-requested content is provided from the alternate network services <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight>, it is displayed using the interface <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> as though the preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> provided it. For example, the banner advertisement <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and the navigation menu <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> from the preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> may be displayed, while the content (e.g., search results) from the alternate network service <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> may be formatted and displayed as if the content were provided from the preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As an illustration, the user may access an e-commerce Internet site (i.e., the preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>), select a good and/or service to purchase therefrom, and provide payment information (e.g., credit card information). The banner advertisement <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, navigation menu <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, and content <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> for the e-commerce site are displayed for the user at the workstation <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> via the front-end service <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> at the preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Also in this example, the back-end service <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> at the preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> typically handles payment processing (e.g., <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>). However, the preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> may be unavailable for processing the payment of one or more additional users. For example, where there are other users providing payment information to the network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, the back-end service <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> may be unable to process the payments for each of the users. Or the back-end service <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> may be down or otherwise unavailable for processing the user&apos;s payment. According to preferred embodiments of the invention, the user&apos;s payment information is transferred to one of the alternate network services <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> (e.g., the back-end service <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> thereof) for processing (e.g., <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>). As such, the user&apos;s payment is processed, the user receives confirmation of payment, and the user is unaware that the payment was processed at one of the alternate network services <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> (i.e., it is transparent to the user). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> As another illustration, the user may access an Internet search engine (i.e., the preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>) and enter search terms. The banner advertisement <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, navigation menu <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, and content <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> for the search service are displayed for the user at the workstation <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> via the front-end service <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> at the preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Also in this example, the back-end service <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> at the preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> typically handles search requests (e.g., <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>). However, the preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> may be unavailable for fulfilling the search requests for one or more additional users. For example, where there are other users requesting searches from the preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, the back-end service <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> may be unable to fulfill the search requests for each of the users; or the back-end service <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> may be down or otherwise unavailable. Again, and according to preferred embodiments of the invention, the user&apos;s search terms are transferred to one of the alternate network services <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> (e.g., the back-end service <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> thereof) to fulfill the search request (e.g., <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>). As such, the user receives the requested search results, and the user is unaware that the search was conducted through one of the alternate network services <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> As yet another illustration, the user may access an Internet site (not shown) having a banner advertisement <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> for display thereon. The banner advertisement <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may be stored at the preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of an advertising agency responsible for distributing the banner advertisement <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to various Internet sites. When the Internet site is accessed by a user, the Internet site (e.g., a server at the Internet site) accesses the banner advertisement <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> from the advertising agency&apos;s preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> (e.g., <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>). However, where the advertising agency&apos;s preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is unavailable, according to preferred embodiments of the invention, the Internet site instead accesses the banner advertisement <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> from one of the advertising agency&apos;s alternate network services <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> (e.g., <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>). As such, the user is provided with the requested content from the Internet site without having to wait while the Internet site attempts unsuccessfully to access the banner advertisement <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> from the advertising agency&apos;s preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, before providing the user with the requested content. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Yet another embodiment is illustrated using the exemplary interface <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. According to this embodiment, the user receives the requested content through an intermediary network service (e.g., link <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> to the overflow management tool <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>) or via an application at the user workstation <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. That is, the user accesses the intermediary network service, and then accesses other network services through the intermediary network service. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> As an illustration, the interface <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> may include an address box <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> for specifying the preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> (e.g., by URL, IP address, etc.). The user may enter the URL for a preferred search engine (e.g., http://www.PreferredSearchEngine.com) in the address box <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, and the overflow management tool <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> assesses the availability of the preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Where the preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is available, the requested content (i.e., the results <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> from the requested search engine) is provided for the user. However, where the preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is unavailable, the overflow management tool <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> instead provides the user-requested content (i.e., search results <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>) from one of the alternate network services <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> (i.e., an alternate search engine such as <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> As another illustration, the interface <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> may include categories <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight> from which the user may request content. The user selects the preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> using one of the categories <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight>, for example, by pointing the cursor <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> to the corresponding icon (e.g., <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>). In any event, the overflow management tool <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> assesses the availability of the preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Where the preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is available, the requested content is provided for the user. However, where the preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is unavailable, the overflow management tool <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> instead provides the user-requested content from one of the alternate network services <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Yet another embodiment is illustrated using the exemplary interface <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. According to this embodiment, the user again receives the requested content through an intermediary network service (e.g., link <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> to the overflow management tool <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>) or an application at the user workstation <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. However, in this embodiment, the user refines the request for content by selecting the content using subcategories, network names, or the like, from the menu <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> (e.g., selection <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> It is to be understood that the interfaces <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> are merely illustrative of interfaces, and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention thereto. For example, any suitable content may be displayed therein. It is also understood that the interfaces <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> may include any suitable icons, menus, and any other interactive display. For example, the categories <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight> may include, for example, &ldquo;search&rdquo;, &ldquo;travel&rdquo;, &ldquo;directions&rdquo;, &ldquo;stock quotes&rdquo;, or any other predefined and/or user-defined category. Likewise, subcategories may also be provided (e.g., &ldquo;Travel&mdash;Vacation&rdquo;, &ldquo;Travel&mdash;Business&rdquo;, &ldquo;Directions&mdash;Texas&rdquo;, &ldquo;Directions&mdash;Colorado&mdash;Denver&rdquo;, etc.). Or for example, the user may select a network name (e.g., &ldquo;Search Svc <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&rdquo; (<highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight>), &ldquo;http://www.SearchSvc.com&rdquo;, etc.) from the menu <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, the preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> for the category <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight>, subcategory, or network name, etc., may be predefined by the user, by an administrator, based on a subscription or strategic alliance, dynamically based on monitoring the various network services, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> According to the embodiments described with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the user-requested content is preferably provided transparently to the user. Alternately, the user-requested content may be provided through the interface <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>, for example, by &ldquo;framing&rdquo; the user-requested content as content <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> or results <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>. As such, the user may select another preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, for example, using the address box <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, or the categories <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight>, without having to &ldquo;backtrack&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates an exemplary overflow database <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>. The overflow database <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> may include various fields, such as, a preferred service(s) field <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, a threshold field <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, and an alternate service(s) field <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>. The preferred service field <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> identifies the preferred network service(s) <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The threshold field <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> identifies one or more thresholds for the preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> identified by the preferred service field <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. For example, the preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> &ldquo;http://www.svc<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>.com&rdquo; has a threshold value of &ldquo;fifty users&rdquo;. Thus, when the preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is serving fifty users and another user requests access thereto, the preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is considered unavailable according to preferred embodiments of the invention. As such, an alternate network service <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> that provides the same or substantially the same content as that requested by the user from the preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is identified and selected from the alternate service field <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> It is understood that the overflow database <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is given merely as an example and is not intended to limit the scope of the invention thereto. Preferably, the overflow database <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> is a relational database, however, it may take any suitable form and stored on any suitable storage media for use by the overflow management tool <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. The preferred network service(s) <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> may be identified in field <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> in any suitable manner, and need not be an Internet URL as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. In addition, any suitable threshold may be defined in the threshold field <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. For example, the threshold may be based on the number of users, average response time, etc. In addition, the threshold may be defined at the preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> (e.g., by an administrator), may be set by the user, may be based on independent monitoring of the preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, etc. Likewise, the alternate network service(s) <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> defined in the alternate service field <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> may be user-defined, determined automatically (e.g., using Internet &ldquo;bots&rdquo;), ranked, included based on strategic alliances or ownership of the various services, etc. In addition, the alternate network service(s) <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> may be identified in field <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> in any suitable manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In addition, the overflow database <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> may include additional fields. For example, the overflow database <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> may also include a content or category field <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>. The category field may be used to identify preferred network services <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the associated alternate network services <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> based on the category selections made by the user (e.g., categories <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight>). Or for example, the overflow database <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> may also include a profile field <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> for information, statistical or otherwise, related to the availability of the preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and/or the alternate network services <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> (e.g., the frequency of transfers, patterns of unavailability, etc.). Other information may also be gathered for profiling the preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, such as user information gathered from Internet &ldquo;cookies&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Information collected in the profile field <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> may be used to generate a service profile (not shown). For example, the service profile may be used to identify periods of peak demand so that additional capacity can be added during those periods. Or for example, the service profile may be used to determine which alternate network services <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> satisfy the user&apos;s requests for use in strategic alliances. Or for example, the service profile may be used to determine the frequency with which an alternate network service <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> was accessed so that suitable payment arrangements may be made. Or for example, the service profile may be used to identify bottlenecks on the network <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> itself that affect the availability of the preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. That is, the bottleneck may be elsewhere on the network <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> (e.g., a router, hub, etc.), and not necessarily at the preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. This may be determined, for example, where the user is transferred to an alternate network service <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> at a time when the preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is locally available (e.g., the back-end service <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> is not busy). Therefore, increasing resource capacity at the preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> may not increase the availability thereof. Instead, additional services may need to be deployed at other physical locations on the network <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, or the bottlenecks on the network <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> itself may need to be addressed, to better provide the user-requested content from the preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> An embodiment of the method for providing user-requested content through at least one of the alternate network services <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> according to the teachings of the invention is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. The method may comprise receiving a request for content in step <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. For example, the user may request content through the interface <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> by specifying a URL for a preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, by selecting a category (e.g., <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>), etc. In step <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, the availability of the preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is assessed. The availability may be that of the entire network service. Alternately, the availability may be that of a portion thereof, such as the availability of the back-end service <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>, a function of the network service (e.g., payment processing), etc. Assessing the availability of the preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> (and the alternate network services <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight>, where applicable) preferably comprises comparing a load thereon to a threshold value (e.g., according to the threshold field <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>). The load is preferably determined using a synthetic transaction. A synthetic transaction is a short data packet transmitted to the network service to generate a response, from which the response time is measured. However, other methods for determining the load on the network service may also be used according to the teachings of the invention, such as, but not limited to, a network bandwidth service, pinging the network service, etc. Where the load at the network service exceeds the threshold, the network service is considered unavailable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Where the user-requested content is available from the preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, the user is linked thereto in step <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>. However, where the user-requested content is not available from the preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, an alternate network service <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> also providing the user-requested content (or substantially similar content) is selected in step <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>. The alternate network service <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> is selected based preferably at least in part on the availability thereof. However, the selection may be based on other factors as well, such as, but not limited to, a ranking of the alternate network services, strategic alliances, user preferences, etc. In step <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight>, the user is linked to the alternate network service <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> selected in step <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>, wherein the user-requested content is provided to the user even when the preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is unavailable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> It is understood that the method shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is merely illustrative of one embodiment of the method of the invention, and that other embodiments are also contemplated as being within the scope of the invention. For example, in another embodiment, the method may also include the steps of profiling the preferred network service <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> based on the availability thereof, and allocating additional resources (e.g., servers, processors, etc.) based on the generated profile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> While illustrative and presently preferred embodiments of the invention have been described in detail herein, it is to be understood that the inventive concepts may be otherwise variously embodied and employed, and that the appended claims are intended to be construed to include such variations, except as limited by the prior art. </paragraph>
