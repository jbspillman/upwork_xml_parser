<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention applies generally to the Internet and World Wide Web, and more particularly to enabling a viewer to move conveniently from page to page among linked web pages by operating a scrolling computer mouse. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In many important Internet applications, pages of the World Wide Web may be linked together, with the intention that a viewer may browse the pages as a set, progressing naturally through from one page to the next. For example, an on-line merchant may offer a catalog that displays a large selection of related products. A viewer may then flip through the product pages, so to speak, until a page comes up that catches his or her interest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> With today&apos;s technology, the viewer must go from page to page in a catalog by using a computer mouse to click on &ldquo;previous&rdquo; and &ldquo;next&rdquo; buttons that are displayed on the screen of a terminal. To do this, the mouse pointer must be located precisely upon these buttons, time after time, and the viewer must repeatedly click on the buttons. Often, this way of interacting with the catalog becomes tedious and annoying, as the mouse pointer may drift away from the buttons, and the viewer may tire from clicking the mouse or moving the mouse pointer to and fro. Further, the importance of having visual feedback while positioning the mouse pointer may divert the viewer&apos;s attention from the informative content of the page. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Consequently, there is a need for a convenient way of moving from page to page within a set of linked web pages, such as the pages of an on-line catalog, so that the viewer is not distracted by the burden of repeatedly clicking the mouse and repositioning its pointer, all the while keeping the pointer true upon the browser buttons while looking somewhere else on the web page. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a convenient way for a viewer to move from page to page within a set of web pages that are linked, and is suitable for browsing an on-line merchant&apos;s catalog or skipping through a list of search results returned by an Internet search engine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, a scrolling mode for a web browser operates under the control of a scrolling computer mouse (a scroll mouse). A may viewer enter the scrolling mode while viewing one of the set of web pages, called here the &ldquo;source page&rdquo; for convenience. Scrolling mode may be entered, for example, by selecting an option from a menu, or by momentarily closing the right-side switch of a two-button computer mouse (making a &ldquo;right click&rdquo;), or the third switch of a three-switch mouse, or the third or forth switches of a four-switch mouse, and so forth. The browser then awaits detection of the viewer&apos;s scrolling input. In general, the viewer may enter scrolling input by operating the scrolling input mechanism of a scroll mouse, for example by rotating a scroll wheel. The sense of direction of the scrolling input is determined. For example, the direction may be forward when the viewer rotates the scroll wheel clockwise with respect to a reference, and backward when the viewer rotates the wheel counterclockwise. Responsive to the direction of the scrolling input, the browser then determines the URL of another page in the set of linked web pages, called here the &ldquo;destination page,&rdquo; and accesses that page. In one embodiment of the invention, the URL of the destination page may be the URL that is called by the source page&apos;s next button or previous button. In another embodiment of the invention, the URL of the destination page may be the URL that is available to the browser&apos;s forward button or back button. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Thus, with the present invention, the viewer may go conveniently from page to page in a set of linked web pages by operating the scrolling input mechanism of a scroll mouse, and need not be limited to clicking on previous and next or forward and back buttons. These and other aspects of the invention will be more fully appreciated when considered in the light of the following detailed description and drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a scrolling mode for a web browser that enables a viewer to move conveniently from page to page within a set of web pages that are linked. The new scrolling mode is suitable for browsing an on-line merchant&apos;s catalog, skipping through a list of search results provided by an Internet search engine, examining a sequence of related or panoramic digital photographic images, and so forth. According to the present invention, the new scrolling mode operates under the control of a scrolling computer mouse (a scroll mouse). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows an exemplary environment suitable for the present invention. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an exemplary terminal <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> includes a visual display <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, a keyboard <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> or other input device such as a keypad, a stylus-selection apparatus, speech recognition apparatus, and so forth, a web browser <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> (as a descriptive convenience, the interchangeable terms &ldquo;browser&rdquo; and &ldquo;web browser&rdquo; are used here in an encompassing sense that includes many of the elements needed to operate a personal computer rather than just application-layer software), web browser memory <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> such as a cache, and a scroll mouse <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. The scroll mouse <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> may include a left-click switch <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, a right-click switch <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight>, and a scrolling input mechanism <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> such as a rotatable scroll wheel. A typical scroll mouse <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,530,455, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference. The terminal <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, which may be a personal computer, a personal digital assistant, a cellular telephone equipped with a web browser, and so forth, is connected by the Internet <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> or other communication network to a web site <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In a typical application, the viewer might use the terminal <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to access an on-line merchant&apos;s home page on the World Wide Web. To access the home page, the viewer might use the keyboard <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> to enter a uniform resource locator (URL) into the web browser <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. The web browser <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> would then connect to the appropriate web site <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> via the Internet <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, and display the requested home page to the viewer on the display <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Typically, the home page would show a number of links to other pages. For example, the home page of an on-line merchant who sells wristwatches might offer links to catalogs that show watches made by several different manufacturers. One of these catalogs might comprise photographs and brief descriptions of M watches, spread over N web pages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The N web pages of the catalog are a typical set of linked web pages. On the first page of such a set of linked web pages, a viewer may be presented with a button labeled &ldquo;next,&rdquo; as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Clicking on the next button <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> calls up the second web page in the linked set. At the bottom of the second web page appear a next button <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and a &ldquo;previous&rdquo; button <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>. Clicking on the next button <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> of the second page calls up the third page of the set of linked pages; clicking on the previous button <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> of the second page recalls the first page. Generally, clicking on the next button <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> that appears on page K calls up page K&plus;1, whereas clicking on the previous button <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> of page K calls up page K&minus;1, where the page order, or sequence, is determined by the catalog provider. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In addition to product catalogs, a list of search results provided by an Internet search engine also may be a set of linked web pages when the list itself is too long to be displayed as a single page. Each page of a multi-page search list may include a next button <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and a previous button <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>, which the viewer clicks on to move through the pages of the list. The same general arrangement, the use of a next button <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and a previous button <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>, is also applicable to a wide range of other situations, for example the presentation of a sequence of digital photographic images, and is not limited to on-line shopping catalogs or Internet search lists. In these situations, the content provider, for example the merchant that provides the on-line catalog, explicitly determines the sequence provided by the links of the set of linked web pages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> A set of linked web pages and a sequence for that set may also be constructed implicitly by the viewer and the browser <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. For example, when the organization of the web site <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> does not lend itself to a catalog structure, the viewer often looks at various pages in a sequence determined by the viewer. The browser <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> may sequentially record the URLs of these pages (or hold the pages themselves) in the web browser memory <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>, which may be a cache or other memory, and thereby create a set of linked web pages. The viewer may move through the set of linked web pages by clicking on a &ldquo;forward&rdquo; button <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> or a &ldquo;back&rdquo; button <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> provided by the browser <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Thus the browser <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> may associate its forward button <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and its back button <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> with the URLs of particular members of a set of linked web pages, where the association is determined implicitly by the past actions of the viewer as recorded in the browser memory <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>, or may associate its next button <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and its previous button <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> with the URLs of particular members of a set of linked web pages, where the association is determined explicitly by the web site. Based upon either of these associations, the viewer may move through the set of linked web pages, whether the sequence of the set is created explicitly by a web site or implicitly by the viewer, by clicking on the next button <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and the previous button <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>, or clicking on the forward button <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and the back button <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Unfortunately, the method just described of moving through the set of linked web pages is sometimes awkward and therefore undesirable, as discussed earlier. In contrast, the present invention enables a viewer to move through a set of linked web pages more conveniently by using a scrolling mode for the browser <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. The new scrolling mode is controlled by the scrolling output of a scroll mouse <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> operated by the viewer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The viewer may enter and exit the scrolling mode of the present invention by selecting from a menu of options, or by clicking with the right-click switch <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> of the scroll mouse <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, or by clicking with a third-click or fourth-click switch of a multi-switch scroll mouse, or by spoken command when speech-recognition apparatus is available, and so forth. When scrolling mode is active, the scroll mouse <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> provides scrolling output in response to the viewer&apos;s manipulation of the scrolling mechanism <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>. The scrolling mechanism <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> may be a rotatable scroll wheel, a scroll lever, a jog wheel that is mounted, for example, on the side of a hand-held device such as a web-enabled cellular telephone, and so forth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the browser <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> displays the source page (step <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>). The source page may be any member of the set of linked web pages&mdash;the word &ldquo;source&rdquo; is used here only to indicate that the page is presently displayed and that the viewer may move away from the presently displayed page to any other page that is a member of the set of linked web pages. Said other page is called here the &ldquo;destination page.&rdquo; Thus, the source page is the page moved from, and the destination page is the page moved to, where both the source page and the destination page are members of the set of linked web pages; the terms source page and destination page as used here have no other special meaning. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> While displaying the source page, the browser <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> awaits detection of scrolling output from the scroll mouse <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>). If scrolling output is not detected, the browser <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> continues to await scrolling output or other instructions (step <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>). Otherwise (i.e., scrolling output is detected), a sense of direction of the scrolling output is determined (step <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>). Here, directional convention is unimportant, and may be assigned according to the nature of the scrolling input mechanism <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> and the preference of the viewer. For example, when the scrolling input mechanism <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> is a rotatable scroll wheel, rotation of the wheel by extension of the index finger of a right-handed viewer who is grasping the mouse conventionally may be defined as &ldquo;forward,&rdquo; and opposite rotation of the wheel may be defined as &ldquo;backward.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Responsive to the sense of direction of the scrolling output, the URL of the destination page is determined (step <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>). When the sense of direction is forward, the URL of the destination page may be the URL associated with the next button <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> or the forward button <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>; when the sense of direction is backward, the URL of the destination page may be the URL associated with the previous button <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> or the back button <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight>. The browser <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> accesses the destination page (step <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight>) through the Internet <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. At this point, the web page that was the destination page now takes the role of the source page (step <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>), which the browser then displays (step <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> From the foregoing description, those skilled in the art will recognize that the viewer may use the scrolling mode of the present invention to move conveniently thought a set of linked web pages without unproductive distraction. The foregoing description is illustrative rather than limiting, however, and the scope of the invention is limited only by the following claims. </paragraph>
