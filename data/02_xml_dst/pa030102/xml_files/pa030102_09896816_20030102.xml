<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to apparatus and methods for controlling the flow of lubricants in a gear assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In another respect, the invention relates to apparatus and methods for filtering lubricants in a gear assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In a further respect, the invention relates to apparatus and methods for lubricating designated portions of a gear assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The transmission and differential gear assembly of a vehicle typically include a plurality of lubricated gears. The differential gear assembly is an arrangement of gears forming an epicyclic train for connecting two shafts or axles in the same line, dividing the driving force equally between them, and permitting one shaft to revolve faster than the other when desired (as by the driving wheels of an automobile that is moving along a curved path of travel), the speed of the main driving member always being equal to the algebraic mean of the speeds of the two shafts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> One problem associated with conventional gear assemblies is the tendency of a particular bearing assembly or other portion of the gear assembly to be inadequately lubricated, resulting in the premature failure of that portion of the gear assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it would be highly desirable to provide an improved method and apparatus for lubricating a gear assembly to reduce the risk of premature failure of a particular portion of the gear assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Therefore, it is a principal object of the invention to provide an improved gear assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Another object of the invention is to provide an improved gear assembly which improves the lubrication of a particular portion of the gear assembly.</paragraph>

<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Briefly, in accordance with the invention, I provide improvements for a differential gear assembly. The gear assembly includes a housing including at least one inwardly extending flange on the inside of the housing; a reservoir of lubricating fluid in the housing; and, a plurality of gears mounted in the housing. A portion of at least one of the gears extends into the reservoir of fluid when the differential gear assembly is at rest. The housing and gears are shaped and dimensioned such that during operation of the differential gear assembly, the gear extending into the reservoir turns and throws fluid from the reservoir against the flange. The improvements comprise a fluid control member for at least partially preventing fluid thrown by the gear extending into the reservoir from contacting flange. The fluid control member comprises a control member mounted inside the housing adjacent the flange. The control member covers at least a portion of the flange such that a greater portion of the lubricating fluid thrown toward the flange by the gear contacts the control member and flows past the flange. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the invention, I provide improvements for a gear assembly. The gear assembly includes a housing; a reservoir of lubricating fluid in the housing; and, a plurality of gears mounted in the housing. A portion of at least one of the gears extends into the reservoir of fluid when the differential gear assembly is at rest. The gear assembly also includes an operational surface which requires lubrication. The housing and gears are shaped and dimensioned such that during operation of the gear assembly, the gear extending into the reservoir turns and displaces fluid out of the reservoir. The improvements comprise a fluid control member mounted on the housing for collecting lubricating fluid displaced out of the reservoir by the gear extending into the reservoir; and, for directing lubricating fluid against the operational surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In a further embodiment of the invention, I provide improvements for a gear assembly. The gear assembly includes a housing, a reservoir of lubricating fluid in the housing, and, a plurality of gears mounted in the housing. A portion of at least one of the gears extends into the reservoir of fluid when the differential gear assembly is at rest. The gear assembly also includes an operational surface which requires lubrication. The housing and gears are shaped and dimensioned such that during operation of the gear assembly, the gear extending into the reservoir turns and displaces fluid out of the reservoir. The improvements comprise a fluid control member mounted inside the housing for collecting lubricating fluid displaced out of the reservoir by the gear extending into the reservoir; and, for filtering the lubricating fluid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the invention, I provide an improved method for controlling the flow of lubricant in a gear assembly. The gear assembly includes a housing including at least one inwardly extending flange on the inside of the housing, includes a reservoir of lubricating fluid in the housing, and includes a plurality of gears mounted in the housing. A portion of at least one of the gears extends into the reservoir of fluid when the differential gear assembly is at rest. The housing and gears are shaped and dimensioned such that during operation of the differential gear assembly, the gear extending into the reservoir turns and displaces fluid from the reservoir against the flange. The improved method includes the steps of providing a control member shaped and dimensioned such that when the control member is mounted inside the housing, fluid displaced against the control member is deflected to a selected direction of travel. The improved method also includes the steps of installing the control member inside the housing adjacent the flange; and, operating the differential gear assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Turning now to the drawings, which illustrate the presently preferred embodiments of the invention for the purpose of illustrating the practice thereof, and not by way of limitation of the scope of the invention, and in which like reference characters refer to like element throughout the several views, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates a portion of a conventional stamped differential housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for rear wheel drive vehicles. The housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes arcuate rear cover <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, side <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and side <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Side <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> opposes and is spaced apart from side <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. When housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is installed on a vehicle, cover <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> faces the back or rear of the vehicle, side <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is on top, and side <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is on the bottom facing the ground. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the front cover (not shown) of housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is attached using the externally threaded ends of bolts <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and other bolts (not visible) which extend outwardly from housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, rear cover <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is removed to reveal additional internal construction details of housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. An arcuate aperture is formed through upper wall <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and is circumscribed by peripheral edge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Another arcuate aperture is formed through lower wall <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and is circumscribed by arcuate peripheral edge <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The portions of wall <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> adjacent edges <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> are substantially parallel to the portions of wall <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> adjacent edges <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> portion of upper wall <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> forms a first flange <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> which is connected to and extends outwardly from side <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Flange <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> includes a portion of edge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Similarly, a portion of lower wall <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> forms a second flange <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> which is connected to and extends outwardly from side <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Flange <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> includes a portion of edge <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Flange <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is substantially parallel to flange <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>. As will be discussed with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, flanges <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> interfere with the circular flow or path of travel of lubricant that is caused by and associated with the rotation of ring gear <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. As will be further discussed with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, in the practice of one embodiment of the invention, a flow control member, indicated by dashed lines <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, is inserted between and adjacent flanges <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> and adjacent the inner arcuate surface <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of side <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The flow control member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> reduces the interference of flanges <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> with the circular flow of lubricant produced by the rotation of ring gear <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. When gear turns it displaces liquid lubricant out of reservoir <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> along a generally circular path of travel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> To install member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, bolts <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> are removed from flange <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>, member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is installed in the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, and the ends of bolts <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are inserted through the apertures <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) formed in the side of member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and through the pre-existing apertures in flange <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> which are each aligned with one of apertures <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. When member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is installed in the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, apertures <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> align and are in registration with existing apertures in flange <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> so that each bolt <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> can be inserted through one of apertures <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and through one of the apertures in flange <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> which is in registration with apertures <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. As would be appreciated by those of skill in the art, member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can, instead of being secured with bolts, be welded, glued, or otherwise secured in the position illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>. Member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is arcuate and is shaped and dimensioned to conform to and fit against surface <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and between flanges <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> in the manner illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Interconnected walls <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> outwardly depend from base <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Rectangular aperture <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is formed through base <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, as are apertures <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. A tube <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> can be affixed to aperture <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> such that lubricant flowing through aperture <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> flows into the tube <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and flows out the end <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>A of tube <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. Tube <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is shaped and dimensioned such that lubricant flows out of end <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>A at a desired location in a gear assembly; for instance, flows out of tube <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and onto a bearing or other operational surface which requires lubrication. Aperture <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can also be provided with a tube which receive lubricant flowing out of aperture <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and carries the lubricant to a desired location in a gear assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, when ring gear <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is rotating during operation of the differential assembly (and during the simultaneous operation of the vehicle engine or other prime mover which turns the gear <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and other parts of the differential assembly), gear <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> displaces oil or other lubricant from reservoir <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> into member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the directions indicated by arrows M and N. The lubricant flows intermediate base <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and inner surface <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> to apertures <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in the manner indicated by arrows P and O, respectively. The lubricant then exits through aperture <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in the direction indicated by arrow C (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) and through aperture <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in the direction indicated by arrow B (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Apertures <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are sized such that during operation of the differential assembly, the space <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> between base <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and surface <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> fills up with lubricant and the continued delivery by ring gear <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of lubricant to aperture <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> creates pressure in the inner space <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> bounded by member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and surface <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> because lubricant can not exit through apertures <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> as quickly as the lubricant is being delivered through aperture <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. This pressurization of the lubricant in member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and the resultant slow down of lubricant flowing into aperture <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> in the direction of arrows M and N, facilitates the travel of lubricant against and past the outer surface <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>A of base <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> in the direction indicated by arrow H in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. Surface <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>A deflects some lubricant in the direction indicated by arrow H. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, magnets <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> can be mounted on inner surface <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>B of base <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> to remove iron particles from lubricant flowing through member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The shape and dimension of magnets <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> can vary as desired, as can the placement and number of magnets in member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Other kinds of filter units can be utilized in conjunction with or in place of magnets <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> conventional differential gear assembly includes ring gear <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Gear <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is turned by pinion gear <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The pinion assembly <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> includes a pair of pinion bearings each mounted in its own pinion cup. One end of shaft <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is attached to pinion gear <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The other end of shaft <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> (not shown) is attached to a yolk (not shown). A U-joint interconnects the yolk and the drive shaft. The ring gear is bolted to a carrier (not shown). The carrier is a housing which includes pinion gears and other gears. There are carrier bearings on either side of the carrier. One end of left rear axle (not shown) is connected to the left wheel hub. The other end of the left rear axle extends into housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and into the carrier and engages gears in the carrier which turn the left rear axle. One end of the right rear axle (not shown) is connected to the right wheel hub. The other end of the right rear axle extends into housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and into the carrier and engages gears in the carrier which turn the right rear axle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, flanges <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> in a conventional stamped differential gear assembly interfere with the circular flow or displacement of lubricant produced when ring gear <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is turned in the direction indicated by arrow D. The desired circular flow of lubricant is interrupted when lubricant travels in the direction indicated by arrow E and contacts flange <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, and, travels in the direction indicated by arrow F and contacts and rebounds from flange <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> in the direction indicated by arrow G. The interruption in the flow of lubricant caused by flanges <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> can prevent bearings in the pinion assembly <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> from being properly lubricated. The flow control member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the invention solves this problem by filling the space between flanges <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> which exists above ring gear <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Once this space is filled, a proportion of lubricant travels into member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> via aperture <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> in the manner earlier described and indicated by arrow J in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. However, the remaining outer surface area <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>A of base <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, along with the resistance to lubricant flow through aperture <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> which results when fluid in member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is pressurized, causes the larger proportion of lubricant to travel over the outer surface of base <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and past flanges <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> in the manner indicated by arrow H to reach and lubricate the bearing in the pinion assembly <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> While the ring gear <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is rotating in the direction of arrow D, lubricant which travels up through aperture <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> in the manner indicated by arrow J then travels transverse to the vertically oriented plane in which gear <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> rotates and exits through apertures <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. If desired, apertures <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are positioned over carrier bearings, or tubes <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> attached to apertures <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> direct lubricant to carrier bearings or to any other operational surface in the differential bearing assembly which requires lubrication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>, line <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> indicates level of oil or other lubricant in the reservoir <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> in the differential gear assembly when ring gear <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is at rest and is not moving. Once the motor of the vehicle is started and the vehicle begins to move forward (or backward), the differential gear <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> begins to operate (rotate) and displaces and carries lubricant upwardly out of the lubricant along a generally circular path of travel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As would be appreciated by those of skill in the art, the transmission of a vehicle along includes a plurality of gears and a lubricating fluid. The flow control member of the invention can be utilized in a transmission to filter transmission fluid, to direct transmission fluid to desired lubrication points, and to improve the fluid flow in a transmission. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be shaped and dimensioned to improve lubricant flow in a gear assembly by directing lubricant flow in any desired direction or manner, regardless of whether flanges <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> are present. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be produced in a variety of shapes and dimensions as long as the desired function or functions of the invention are served. For example, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7 a</cross-reference> fluid control member is formed by bending a strip of metal into the arcuate U-shape shown. The size, position of and spacing between apertures <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A, and <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>A in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> corresponds to that of apertures <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, respectively, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The size and position of each aperture <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> can vary as desired. Only one of apertures <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be utilized, or lubricant return apertures can be utilized in addition to or in place of apertures <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, when member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is installed inside housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the outer surface <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>A of base <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is substantially flush, or even, with edges <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. While this is desired in the practice of the invention, it is not required. If member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is shaped and dimensioned such surface <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>A of that base <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is inset from edges <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> toward surface <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, this permits some of the lubricant to contact flange <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>. Even if this occurs, member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> still facilitates the flow of lubricant toward the bearings in pinion assembly <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> because member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> will cover at least a portion of the surfaces of flange <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> which were exposed prior to the insertion of member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>.</paragraph>
