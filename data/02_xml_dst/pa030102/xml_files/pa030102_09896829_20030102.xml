<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a wireless communication system, and more particularly to an antenna for a wireless communication system. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> One example of a wireless communication system is a Multi-channel Multi-point Distribution System (&ldquo;MMDS&rdquo;), which offers broadband data and voice transmission over a terrestrial microwave platform. MMDS can deliver, for example, multi-channel television programming, Internet access and content, voice communications, data transfer services, and other interactive services. MMDS typically operates in the 2.5 GHz band in North America and in the 3.5 GHz band in international markets. Also, the United States Federal Communications Commission (&ldquo;FCC&rdquo;) has allocated the 27.5 to 29.5 GHz band to Local Multi-point Distribution Services (&ldquo;LMDS&rdquo;). Signals typically are transmitted within a line of sight (&ldquo;LOS&rdquo;) from a base station transmit antenna to a subscriber&apos;s receive antenna (&ldquo;downstream&rdquo; transmission), and from a subscriber&apos;s transmit antenna to a base station&apos;s receive antenna (&ldquo;upstream&rdquo; transmission). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Wireless communication systems, such as, for example, MMDS, are well suited to serve the small office/home office (&ldquo;SOHO&rdquo;), telecommuter, and small business market, although they may be used in other markets, such as residential, medium business and large business. Wireless communication systems also are well suited to provide communication services to remote and difficult to reach locations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> At present, broadband wireless communication systems, including those in the MMDS band, depend upon antenna height to allow reasonable coverage of large areas with a small number of base stations. Base station antennas may be placed, for example, on mountain tops, tall buildings, or towers such as, for example, existing cellular towers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Presently, base station antennas typically use omni-directional, cardioid antenna patterns for downstream transmission and azimuthally-sectored antenna patterns for upstream transmission reception. The increased gain of the sectorized upstream antenna pattern helps to balance the signal-to-noise ratio (&ldquo;SNR&rdquo;) margins between the upstream and downstream cases due, at least in part, to differences between the transmit power of the base station and the transmit power of the subscriber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The capacity of each base station is limited by a number of factors. For example, the downstream capacity may be limited by the absence of frequency re-use. The upstream capacity may be limited, for example, by available RF bandwidth, spectrally inefficient modulation, and low transmit power at the subscriber transmitter. At present, each base station is limited to approximately 10,000 subscribers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Current wireless communication systems, including MMDS systems, require complex installation procedures due to the need for a clear LOS from the subscriber location to the base station antenna. Service providers must perform time consuming pre-installation site surveys to assure that the LOS condition is met. However, it is frequently not possible to provide a clear LOS to every subscriber. For example, in the San Francisco Bay area, only approximately 40% of the requested installations can be performed. The installations which proceed are very costly because they require carefully positioned and pointed antennas at both the base station and the subscriber location. Typically, the antenna at the subscriber location must be positioned outdoors, typically high up on a roof or tower, and associated grounding and wiring must be run inside.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Wireless communication systems may employ a cellular concept in which a given service area is subdivided into multiple cells. Service to each cell is typically covered by a base station. Each base station normally uses only a fraction of the total number of frequency channels available to the entire wireless communication system. The base stations in nearby cells typically are assigned different groups of frequency channels, and all of the available frequency channels typically are assigned to a relatively small number of base stations. For example, a cluster of N cells may be used to complete the set of available frequencies. N is the frequency reuse factor of the system, where each cell within a cluster typically is assigned 1/N of the total available frequency channels in the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Assigning different groups of frequency channels to neighboring base stations helps to minimize interference. The available frequencies may be reused when covering larger areas by designing the system such that cells using the same group of frequency channels do not interfere with each other beyond tolerable limits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> A typical setup of a wireless communication system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, such as a MMDS system, is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The wireless communication system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> typically has at least one base station <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. Each base station <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> typically serves one or more subscribers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. In a fixed wireless communication system, the subscribers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are stationary, whereas the subscribers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are capable of changing location in a mobile wireless communication system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Information to be sent downstream to a subscriber may be routed to the base station <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> through a network <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. The information may include data such as, for example, analog data, digital data, voice, or television signals. The network <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> may include any of the various mechanisms known for delivering data. For example, the network <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> may include analog or digital wired and wireless telephone networks, such as, for example, public switched telephone networks (&ldquo;PSTN&rdquo;), integrated services digital networks (&ldquo;ISDN&rdquo;), all types of digital subscriber lines (&ldquo;xDSL&rdquo;), advanced mobile telephone service (&ldquo;AMPS&rdquo;), global system for mobile communications (&ldquo;GSM&rdquo;), Synchronous Optical Network (&ldquo;SONET&rdquo;) ring network or long distance fiber backbones. The network <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> also may include the Internet, the World Wide Web, one or more local area networks (&ldquo;LANs&rdquo;) and/or one or more wide area networks (&ldquo;WANs&rdquo;), radio, cable, satellite, and/or any other delivery mechanism for carrying data. The base station <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> will transmit the information downstream to the subscriber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Likewise, information sent upstream from the subscriber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to the base station <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> may be routed though the network <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> to the final destination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The base station <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> may include signal processing equipment <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, a transmitter <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>, a receiver <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, and an antenna <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>. The signal processing equipment <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> receives from the network <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> the data that are to be sent downstream to a subscriber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The signal processing equipment <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> may perform, for example, demodulation, modulation, frequency conversion, encryption, decryption, or other actions to prepare a signal for transmission by a transmitter. The signal processing equipment <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is connected to a transmitter <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>, which may, for example, amplify the signal or perform modulation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The transmitter <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> may be a dedicated transmitter or a transceiver. The transmitter <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> is connected to the antenna <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The antenna <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> transmits a signal containing the information downstream to a subscriber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The antenna <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> may be one antenna or multiple antennas. The antenna <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> has a downstream transmit antenna pattern. The antenna pattern may be formed, for example, by a Butler Matrix or a phased array design. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Signals containing information to be sent upstream from a subscriber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to the base station <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> are received by the antenna <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>, which also has an upstream receive antenna pattern that may be formed, for example, by a Butler Matrix or a phased array design. The antenna <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> is connected to a receiver <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, which receives the signal and may, for example, perform amplification or demodulation of the signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The receiver <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may be a dedicated receiver or a transceiver, and is connected to the signal processing equipment <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The signal processing equipment <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> may perform, for example, demodulation, modulation, frequency conversion, encryption, decryption, or other actions necessary to prepare a signal for transmission over the network <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The transmitter <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> and the receiver <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, or a transceiver, may be connected to one antenna or multiple antennas. The transmitter <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> and the receiver <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may share the same antenna or group of antennas, or, alternatively, may use separate antennas or groups of antennas. For example, the transmitter <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> may be connected to a single antenna or multiple antennas, and the receiver <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may be connected to a different single antenna or multiple antennas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The subscriber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may include an antenna <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, a receiver <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, signal processing equipment <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, information processing device <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>, and a transmitter <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. A transceiver may replace the separate transmitter <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> and receiver <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Signals containing information sent downstream from a base station <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> to the subscriber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are received by the antenna <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, which may be one antenna or multiple antennas. The antenna <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is connected to the receiver <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, which receives the signal, and may perform, for example, amplification or demodulation of the signal before sending the signal to the signal processing equipment <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. The signal processing equipment <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> may perform, for example, demodulation, modulation, frequency conversion, encryption, decryption, or other actions necessary to prepare a signal for transmission to the information processing device <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The information processing device <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> is connected to the signal processing equipment <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and may, for example, display, store, edit, or otherwise manipulate the information sent from the network <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. The information processing device <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> may be, for example, a personal computer, a microprocessor, a digital computer, a television set, a set top box, a telephone, a speaker, a cathode ray tube, or another display, computing, or storage device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> For upstream transmission of information from the subscriber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to the network <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>, the signal processing equipment <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> receives the data from the information processing device <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>. The signal processing equipment <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> may perform, for example, demodulation, modulation, frequency conversion, encryption, decryption, or other actions to prepare a signal for transmission by the transmitter <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> to which the signal processing equipment <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is connected. The transmitter <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> may, for example, amplify the signal or perform modulation, and is connected to the antenna <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, which transmits a signal containing the information upstream to a base station <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, an antenna pattern <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> for downstream transmission by a base station is partitioned into azimuthal sectors <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. The antenna pattern <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may be formed by a single antenna, such as, for example, a Butler Matrix, or by multiple antennas, such as, for example, a phased array. In the example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the azimuthal sectors <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> are 15 degrees and there are 24 sectors in 360 degrees of coverage. The azimuthal sectors <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> of the example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> have a frequency reuse factor (&ldquo;K&rdquo;) of 2, such that adjacent beams alternate in frequency. This additional beamforming with 24 sectors over 360 degrees and a frequency re-use factor of 2 allows for approximately a six-fold increase in capacity for the downstream transmissions over an omni-directional antenna pattern without frequency reuse. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Even greater capacity increases may be achieved by allocating more bandwidth to areas of greater subscriber density. Assuming that traffic requirements are not uniform, but instead may vary by a factor of two or more over different areas, the flexibility in allocating frequencies may achieve another two-fold capacity improvement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The sidelobe levels <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> of the sector beams <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> are an important design consideration in the antenna pattern <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, and depend upon, among other factors, the type of signal being transmitted downstream. For example, the sidelobe levels <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> should be approximately 33 dB to support transmission of 64-Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (&ldquo;QAM&rdquo;) signals. A 33 dB sidelobe level represents near state of the art in array sidelobe design. Another example is a sidelobe level of approximately 27 dB for a 16-QAM signal. Antennas with 27 dB sidelobe levels are readily found in the marketplace today. The sector beams <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> of the implementation shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> have 30 dB sidelobes <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The sectorized beams <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> for downstream transmission also has a widened elevation beamwidth as compared to current downstream transmit antenna elevation beamwidths. The elevation beamwidth is widened due to a roll-off in the gain of the main beam as a subscriber comes closer to the base station transmitter. If the beam has a wider elevation beamwidth, the SNR does not roll-off as quickly with decreasing subscriber distance to the base station transmitter. Widening of the elevation beamwidth also helps to simplify installation procedures, and may even allow the subscriber to install an antenna indoors by providing more signal margin for wall penetration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> For example, present antennas may typically have an elevation beamwidth of approximately 8 degrees, and the sectorized beams <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> are widened in elevation beyond 8 degrees. For example, the sectorized beams <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> may be widened to approximately 15-20 degrees in elevation in order to provide full gain to subscribers located anywhere from very near the base station transmitter out to the maximum radius of the service area. Also, to achieve greater gain and SNR margin, the downstream antenna pattern may be partitioned into elevation sectors as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and described below with respect to the upstream antenna pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The downstream antenna pattern control in azimuth and elevation may be accompanied by an increase in transmitter Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) to the FCC MMDS authorized limit, which is currently 69 dBW per 6 MHz. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, an upstream receive antenna beam pattern <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> for a base station is formed of multiple beams <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>, each having an azimuth beamwidth <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> and an elevation beamwidth <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. The beams <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> are arranged in more than one elevation sector <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, and use a pattern of non-overlapping frequency bands between adjacent elevation sectors <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. The beam pattern <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> may be formed by a single antenna, such as, for example, a Butler Matrix, or by multiple antennas, such as, for example, a phased array. In the example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, there are three elevation sectors <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>B, and <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>C. The azimuthal beamwidth <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> is 15 degrees and there are four non-overlapping frequency bands (i.e., K&equals;4), F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, F<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and F<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, that may be allocated to any given beam. Thus, there are a total of 36 beams over 180 degrees of azimuthal coverage, or 72 beams over 360 degrees of azimuthal coverage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The bottom-most elevation sector <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>A has adjacent beams using an alternating pattern of frequencies F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in azimuth. The middle elevation sector <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>B has adjacent beams using an alternating pattern of frequencies F<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and F<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in azimuth. The top-most elevation sector <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>C has adjacent beams using an alternating pattern of frequencies F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in azimuth. This antenna pattern offers a 12-fold increase in capacity compared to a sectorized azimuthal antenna pattern with 15 degree sectors, K&equals;2 frequency reuse, and only one elevation sector. The additional gain and SNR margin afforded by the beam pattern <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> allows a lower cost, non-LOS installation at a significantly greater number of subscriber locations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows the concepts described above with respect to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> extended to a larger cellular deployment. In particular, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows a cellular pattern <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> made from a collection of individual cells <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> having K&equals;3 frequency reuse. Each cell <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> contains a base station <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> near the center of the cell <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>. The base station <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> in each cell <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> may use the downstream beam pattern <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and/or the upstream beam pattern <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The three frequency bands <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> are further split up into sectors (not shown) formed by the different beam patterns for upstream and downstream transmission, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> If the cell radius is equal to D, then the design range of the cell is approximately 1.5D. The design range is the range at which the signal margin is approximately zero. The approximate design range of the signal from three base station locations is shown by dotted lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The subscriber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> has the option of using any one of the 3 base stations that overlap in coverage at the subscriber&apos;s location. Thus, overlap of coverage patterns from the base stations can provide increased coverage and increased capacity. Overlapped coverage patterns can be mitigated by having directional beams on the receive antenna <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> at the subscriber location <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, which may include adaptive beams that combine signals and reject unwanted signals. These directional beams, including those formed using adaptive beamforming techniques, can be used at the subscriber location <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to take advantage of overlapping beams in the cellular structure for diversity improvement and rejection of unwanted signals. Further, using elevation and azimuth sectoring in the upstream transmission and azimuth sectoring in the downstream with frequency reuse helps to increase capacity, increase gain, and increase SNR margin for the signals. This, in turn, may provide for non-LOS operation and indoor or window sill area installation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Since the design range of the cell is greater than the cell radius, there is a chance that there may be co-channel interference from neighboring cells using the same set of frequencies. Co-channel interference may be minimized by, among other things, choosing the cell radius to provide sufficient distance between base stations using the same set of frequencies. For example, if the design range of a cell is 20 miles, then D&equals;20 miles/1.5&equals;13.3 miles. The additional cellular capacity from re-use of frequency over the 20 mile cell is 1.5<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, or an approximately 2.25 time increase. There is a cost associated with building additional base stations. However, coverage would be improved because there would be more base stations available, and the likelihood of having a base station available from a given window sill or window of a computer room is much greater with multiple base stations available than if there is only one base station that is able to service a subscriber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Because there is a loss of 3&times; in capacity due to cellularization, the cell radius should be chosen to be slightly smaller than discussed above. For example, in the implementation described above, where the design range, D, is 20 miles, the radius to offset the 3&times; loss (and increase the capacity back 3&times; vs. 2.25&times; discussed above) is equal to D/{square root}{square root over (3)}&equals;11.6 miles. The cell radius should not be made too small, as there is an increased potential for co-channel interference as the cell radius shrinks. The likelihood of co-channel interference may be reduced through proper subscriber antenna directionality or modified sidelobe rejection design. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> A number of implementations have been described. Nevertheless, it will be understood that various modifications may be made. For example, in order to form the upstream beam pattern and/or the downstream beam pattern, a single antenna may be used with, for example, a Butler Matrix, or, alternatively, multiple separate antennas may be used. Adaptive beam forming techniques, which are well known in the art, may be used in forming the upstream beam pattern or the downstream beam pattern. A transceiver may be substituted for a transmitter, a receiver, or both. Any combination of azimuthal sector or elevation sector, or both, may be used for the downstream antenna pattern or the upstream antenna pattern. Also, for example, the sector sizes, the elevation beam widths, the number of upstream elevation sectors, the side lobe levels, and the frequency reuse factor may all be varied. Accordingly, other implementations are within the scope of the following claims. </paragraph>
