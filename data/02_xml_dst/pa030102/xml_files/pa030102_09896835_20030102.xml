<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a method and system for providing telecommunications services, and even more particularly relates to providing an audio annunciation of a calling party&apos;s name and/or telephone number to a called party. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Many telecommunications service providers provide caller ID service. Caller ID service displays caller ID information (such as a calling party&apos;s name and/or telephone number) to a called party. Presently, some wireline phones and wireless phones include liquid crystal displays (LCDs) or other types of displays that are used to display the caller ID information. However, some wireless and wireline phones do not include a display capable of displaying caller ID information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> One solution to provide caller ID service to wireline phones without displays is to connect a caller ID box to the wireline phone. The caller ID box includes a display for displaying the caller ID information when a telephone call is received. One drawback to the caller ID box is that it is typically located near a phone jack and may be far away from the wireline phone of the called party (particularly if the wireline phone is a cordless telephone). For example, a called party with a cordless wireline telephone may be sitting on a sofa watching television when a call is received. Even if the called party has the cordless wireline phone with them, the called party must move to wherever the caller ID box is to view the caller ID information. Another drawback of the caller ID box is that it does not work with wireless phones, such as cellular telephones. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Another drawback of current caller ID services is that the displayed caller ID information may be difficult to see for people with vision problems. Another problem with wireless phones is that the called party may be busy with another activity, such as driving, and may be unable to divert their eyes to view the caller ID display. If the caller ID information may not be viewed by the called party, then the called party must either answer the phone to find out who the calling party is or allow the call to go unanswered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Thus, there is a need for a method and system for providing a caller ID service that does not require a display device. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the invention comprises an audio calling name and calling number delivery method. When a call is made from a calling party telephone to a called party telephone, a message is sent from an originating service switching point (SSP) associated with the calling party telephone to a terminating mobile switching center (MSC) associated with the wireless called party telephone. Typically, the message comprises the directory number of the calling party telephone. A wireless trigger is tripped at the terminating MSC and, in response, a query is sent to a service control point (SCP). A home location register (HLR) associated with the wireless telephone is queried to determine whether the wireless telephone is available. If the wireless telephone is available, then a name and a number associated with the calling party telephone is forwarded to a service node. The service node places a call to the wireless telephone and an audio annunciation of the name and the number is played to the called party. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the invention is a method for providing an audio calling name and number feature to a wireless telephone in association with a telephone call from a calling party telephone to the wireless telephone. A message (including the directory number of the calling party telephone) is sent from an originating service switching point (SSP) associated with the calling party telephone to a terminating mobile switching center (MSC) associated with the wireless telephone. A wireless trigger is tripped at the terminating MSC and, in response, a query is sent to a service control point (SCP). The SCP queries a home location register (HLR) associated with the wireless telephone to determine whether the wireless telephone is available and, if so, the SCP forwards a name and a number associated with the calling party telephone to a service node. The service node places a call from the service node to the wireless telephone and plays an audio annunciation of the name and the number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the SCP retrieves the name and the number are from a database. In another embodiment, whether the called party has rejected the call is determined and, if so, then the outgoing call is dropped and an announcement is played to the calling party. The rejection may be an audible rejection from the called party, a keypad input rejection, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> These and other features, advantages, and aspects of the present invention may be more clearly understood and appreciated from a review of the following detailed description of the disclosed embodiments and by reference to the appended drawings and claims.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed toward a method and system for providing an audio annunciation of a calling party&apos;s name and/or telephone number to a called party. In one embodiment, the invention is implemented as part of a telecommunications system including an advanced intelligent network (AIN). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the drawings, in which like numerals represent like elements throughout the several figures, aspects of the present invention and the advanced intelligent network (AIN) will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The modem public switched telephone network (PSTN) has separate signaling paths for voice signals (or other customer-utilized communication circuits) and for control signals, which include information transmitted throughout the network to control the connection and disconnection of the voice circuits. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T) developed an early species of common channel interoffice signaling (CCIS). CCIS is essentially a network architecture for a switched telephone network in which information about a telephone call is transmitted over high-speed data links that are separate from the voice circuits that are used to transmit the signals of the call itself. Early in the development of common channel interoffice signaling, it was recognized that the interoffice data signaling links could be designed to provide high-speed digital data that could first determine whether a call could be completed prior to assigning trunk capacity to set up the voice link. Thus, with common channel interoffice signaling, the identity of the dialed number can be transmitted over the interoffice signaling data links from the originating central office to the terminating central office, which is the central office that services the dialed or called number. CCIS offers benefits such as speeding up the setting up and tearing down of phone calls. CCIS also allows much more information (such as the calling number, a message, etc.) to be carried about the phone call than that carried on in-band signaling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> If the dialed number is busy, data representing this information is transmitted back over the interoffice signaling link to the originating central office that locally provides an audible busy signal to the caller. Therefore, no long distance trunk capacity is occupied during this process, and the voice circuits remain free for other uses. If the dialed number is not busy, various devices in the network respond to the information about this call to assign interoffice trunks to set up a connection for the call. While the call is being set up, the originating central office, based on a signal from the terminating central office, returns an audible ring back tone (RBT) to the caller. Once the dialed number is answered, an answer signal is passed from the terminating central office to the originating central office, the ring back tone is terminated, and the call is completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The public switched telephone network (PSTN) that evolved in the 1980s incorporated the advanced intelligent network (AIN). Some of the components of the advanced intelligent network are illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a block diagram representing at least a part of the advanced intelligent network (AIN) <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of a typical local exchange carrier. The advanced intelligent network (AIN) uses the signaling system <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (SS<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) network for signal or system control message transport. The components thereof are well known to those skilled in the art. The operation of many of the components of the advanced intelligent network is also described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,245,719 to Weisser entitled &ldquo;Mediation of Open Advanced Intelligent Network Interface by Shared Execution Environment&rdquo; which is incorporated herein by reference. The SS<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> communications protocol is provided in the document entitled &ldquo;Bell Communications Research Specification of Signaling System 7,&rdquo; Document TR-NWT-000246, Issue 2 (June 1991), plus Revision 1 (December 1991), which is also incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Referring still to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> plurality of central offices is provided in a typical public switched telephone network. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, each central office may include an electronic switch known to those skilled in the art as a service switching point (SSP). These are indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> as SSP switches <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The number of SSP switches depends on the number of subscribers to be served by the public switched telephone network. An SSP is the AIN component of a typical electronic central office switch used by a local exchange carrier. The terms &ldquo;SSP&rdquo; and &ldquo;switch&rdquo; are used interchangeably hereinafter and are understood to refer to a telecommunications switch having AIN capability and which may be utilized for connecting voice channel circuits, including voice channel lines, such as trunk circuits <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, central offices switches (SSP) <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> have a plurality of subscriber lines <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> connected thereto. Each of the subscriber lines <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is connected to a terminating piece or pieces of customer premises equipment that are represented by pay telephone <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and standard telephone sets <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. SSP switches <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are connected by a plurality of trunk circuits indicated as <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. These are the voice path trunks that interconnect the central offices <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and over which calls are connected when completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Each piece of terminating equipment in the PSTN is preferably assigned a directory number. The term &ldquo;directory number&rdquo; is used herein in a manner consistent with its generally understood meaning of a number that is dialed or input by an originating party at an originating station to reach a terminating station associated with the directory number. A directory number, typically a ten digit number, is commonly referred to as a &ldquo;telephone number&rdquo; and may be assigned to a specific telephone line, such as the telephone line <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Much of the intelligence, and the basis for many of the enhanced features of the network, resides in the local AIN service control point (SCP) <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> that is connected to signal transfer point <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> via SS<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> data link <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. As is known to those skilled in the art, AIN service control points, such as AIN SCP <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, are physically implemented by relatively powerful fault tolerant computers. Among the functions performed by the service control points is maintenance of network databases used in providing enhanced services. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Additional devices for implementing advanced network functions within the AIN <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are provided by regional STPs (not shown), regional AIN SCPs (not shown), and a service management system (SMS) <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The STP <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is connected to the SSPs via connections <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Both the regional AIN SCPs and the local AIN SCP <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, which represent a plurality of local AIN SCPs distributed throughout the AIN <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, are connected via respective data links to the SMS <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The SMS <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> provides a centralized platform for remotely programming the various AIN SCPs of the AIN <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> so that a coordinated information processing scheme may be implemented for the AIN <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The SMS <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is implemented by a large general purpose computer and interfaces to business offices of the local exchange carrier and interexchange carriers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In operation, the intelligent network elements of the AIN <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, as described above, communicate with each other via digital data messages transmitted over the network of digital data links. An SSP may be configured to interface with these network elements through the use of a trigger. A trigger in the network is an event associated with a particular subscriber line or call that causes the SSP to generate a data packet message to be sent to a service control point. In order to keep the processing of data and calls as simple and generic as possible at central office switches, such as SSP central office switches <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, a relatively small set of triggers are defined at the SSP central office switches for each call. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The message created by an SSP in response to a trigger is known as a &ldquo;query&rdquo; message. A query message opens a &ldquo;transaction&rdquo; and the SSP generally holds the communication until it receives a reply from an appropriate network element via the network of digital data links instructing the SSP <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to take a certain action. If the SSP <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> receives no instructions within a certain amount of time, the SSP &ldquo;times-out&rdquo; and executes a default task for the communication. The reply to the query message may be a &ldquo;conversation&rdquo; message or a &ldquo;response&rdquo; message. Conversation messages allow for bidirectional exchanges between network elements while the transaction remains open. A &ldquo;response&rdquo; message closes the transaction opened by the query message, and usually instructs the SSP to route the held communication for connection with a terminating station. Query messages, conversation messages, and response messages are standard types of messages defined by the AIN protocol. The details of the AIN protocol are wellknown to those skilled in the art and will not be further described herein. For more information regarding the AIN protocol, see Bellcore Specification GR-1298-CORE Switching Systems Generic Requirements for AIN <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which is incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Having described an exemplary AIN environment in reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an exemplary operating environment for the present invention will be described in reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a block diagram illustrating an exemplary operating environment <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> for an embodiment of the present invention. The environment comprises a plurality of central offices switches (SSP) <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> with a plurality of subscriber lines <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> connected thereto. Each of the subscriber lines <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is connected to a terminating piece or pieces of customer premises equipment that are represented by standard telephone sets <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>. SSP switches <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> are connected by a plurality of trunk circuits indicated as <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. A signal transfer point (STP) <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> is connected to the SSPs via connections <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The environment <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> also comprises an AIN service control point (SCP) <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> that is connected to the STP <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> via SS<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> data link <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight>. The AIN SCP <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> is also connected to a caller ID with name (CNAM) database <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight>. The CNAM database comprises a plurality of directory numbers along with an associated name for the directory number. The CNAM database may be used to provide a look-up database to provide caller ID service. The CNAM database may comprise directory numbers from wireline customers as well as wireless customers of wireless network <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The STP <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> may also be connected via a primary rate interface (PRI) <highlight><bold>259</bold></highlight> to a service node <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>. The service node is used to implement functions such as voice-to-text and text-to-voice conversions, among other functions. Those skilled in the art are familiar with service circuit nodes, which are physically implemented by the same types of computers that embody the SCP <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>. In addition to the computing capability and data base maintenance features, service nodes use ISDN lines and may include DTMF signal recognition devices, tone generation devices, voice synthesis devices and other voice or data resources. While service nodes are physically quite similar to the SCP <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>, there are some important differences in the uses to which they are put. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Service control points, such as SCP <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>, normally implement high volume routing services, such as call forwarding and 800 number translation and routing. They are also used for maintenance of and providing access to high volume databases for authorization of billing, such as credit card number validations. In most local exchange carrier networks, service control points are only used for data base look up and routing services that take place prior to the logical completion of the call, i.e., the provision of a ringing signal to the called subscriber line and ring back to the calling subscriber. By contrast, service nodes are used principally when some custom feature or service is needed that requires an audio connection to the call or transfer of a significant amount of data to a subscriber over a switched connection during or following a call. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The wireless network <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, such as a cellular network, comprises a plurality of mobile switching centers (MSC), such as MSCs <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>257</bold></highlight>. The MSCs are switches providing services and coordination between wireless users in network <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> and external networks. The MSCs may be connected to STP <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> to provide information to the wireline network and receive information from the wireline network. The MSCs also communicate with wireless subscribers, such as via wireless telephones <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The MSCs are connected to a home location register (HLR) <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight>. The HLR is an SS<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> database used to identify/verify a wireless subscriber. The HLR also comprises data related to feature and services subscribed to by wireless subscribers. The HLR is also used during roaming to verify the legitimacy of the subscriber and to provide them with their subscribed features. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Having described an exemplary operating environment above in reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> flow diagram illustrating a method <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> will be described in reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The method <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is for providing an audio calling name and number service to a wireless called telephone in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The method <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> begins at start step <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> when the calling party uses a telephone, such as telephone <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>, to place a call to a called party&apos;s telephone, such as wireless telephone <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight>, by dialing a wireless called party number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, the originating SSP <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> (or the originating MSC if the calling party is calling with a wireless phone) includes a calling party number in an SS<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> message, such as an Integrated Services Digital Network User Part (ISUP) message, that is delivered to a terminating MSC <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> (associated with the called party&apos;s wireless phone). The calling party number is the directory number associated with the telephone <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> of the calling party. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, a wireless call termination trigger is hit at the terminating MSC <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> and a query is sent to the SCP <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>. The wireless trigger may be a wireless intelligent network (WIN) trigger or another type of wireless trigger that initiates the query. When the SCP receives the query, it recognizes that the called party has an audio calling name/number service and that it needs to find an audio annunciation of the calling party&apos;s name as will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, the SCP <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> determines whether the calling party number is valid and whether name and number information regarding the calling party may be presented. For example, the calling party number may have a presentation indicator of &ldquo;Presentation allowed&rdquo;, &ldquo;Presentation restricted&rdquo; or &ldquo;Number Unavailable&rdquo;. An indicator of &ldquo;Presentation restricted&rdquo; means that the calling party has marked his number as private or has an unlisted phone number. An indication of &ldquo;Number Unavailable&rdquo; typically means that the calling party&apos;s number is not present, e.g., the terminating MSC did not receive the calling number through the SS<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> ISUP message. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, the SCP queries the HLR <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> to identify whether the called party&apos;s wireless phone is available. In one embodiment, the query may be via an IS-41 location request. At step <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>, if the called party&apos;s wireless phone is not available, then the SCP instructs the MSC to complete the call and ends processing. If the called party&apos;s wireless phone is available, then the method proceeds to step <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, the SCP <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> checks the calling number and presentation indicator corresponding to the calling party number and, if presentation is allowed, the SCP sends a query to the CNAM database to determine the calling name. The SCP may present the calling party number to the CNAM database, and in return it will get a text string with the name of the calling party, or it will get an &ldquo;unavailable&rdquo; or &ldquo;unknown&rdquo; result. If the calling party is calling from a cell phone served by the same wireless service provider of the called phone, a network element within the cell network may detect that the call comes from another cell phone within the network and then send a request to the appropriate database to get the calling name of the calling party. The method then proceeds to step <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight>, the SCP orders the MSC to forward the call to the service node and the SCP sends to the service node the calling name and number (if available) as well as the presentation indicator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, the service node <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> places an outgoing call to the called party&apos;s directory number. The method then proceeds to step <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>, when the called party answers the call, the service node <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> plays the called party&apos;s name and/or number to the called party. Alternatively, if the calling party&apos;s name/number is unavailable or private, a message indicating this may be played to the called party. It should be understood that if the name of the calling party is not available in the database, then the calling party&apos;s number may be audibly transmitted to the called party. For example, the caller may be calling from another country. The number may be available, but the national CNAM databases may not have the calling number (unless they can search foreign databases). Sometimes the database search may only return the city where the call originated in which case the origination city or locale may be audibly transmitted to the called party. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> It should further be understood that, at step <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>, if the calling party has marked his number as private or has an unlisted phone number then a message indicating that the call is a private call is audibly transmitted to the called party. The service node <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> may use well-known text-to-speech technology to convert the text of the calling party name/number into an audible communication. The method then proceeds to decision step <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> At decision step <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>, it is determined whether the called party has answered the call, rejected the call, or sent the call to voice mail. Typically, the called party may use their telephone keypad to direct the call. Alternatively, the called party may use some other indication such as giving an audible instruction to direct the call. If the called party has answered the call, then the method proceeds to step <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. At step <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, the service node <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> connects the call between the calling party&apos;s line and the called party&apos;s line. The method <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> then ends at step <highlight><bold>399</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> If it is determined at decision step <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> that the called party has rejected the call, then the method proceeds to step <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>. At step <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>, the service node <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> drops the outgoing call and plays an announcement to the calling party. The method then ends at step <highlight><bold>399</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> If, at decision step <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>, it is determined that the called party has selected to send the call to voice mail, then the method proceeds to step <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>. At step <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>, the service node <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> forwards the call to the voice mail service access line for voice mail service. The method then ends at step <highlight><bold>399</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a flow diagram illustrating a method <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> for providing audio calling party name and number service to a wire line telephone in accordance with embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The method <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> begins at start step <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> when the calling party uses a telephone, such as telephone <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>, to place a call to a called party telephone, such as telephone <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>, by dialing a wireline called party number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>, the originating SSP <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> (or the originating MSC if the calling party is calling with a wireless phone) includes a calling party number in an SS<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> message that is delivered to a terminating SSP <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> (associated with the called party&apos;s wireline phone). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>, a trigger is hit at the terminating SSP and a query is sent to the SCP <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>, the SCP <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> determines whether the calling party number is valid and whether name and number information regarding the calling party may be presented. For example, a presentation indicator for the calling party number may indicate &ldquo;Presentation allowed&rdquo;, &ldquo;Presentation restricted&rdquo; or &ldquo;Number Unavailable&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, the SCP requests the status of the called party&apos;s line to determine whether it is available or busy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight>, if the called party&apos;s line is busy, then the SCP instructs the SSP to complete the call and ends processing.
