<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A strain relief attachment for attaching a telephone communication cord to a telephone test set has a line cord strain relief element, a grooved neck portion of which has at least one moisture barrier rib and is insertable through a tunnel at an end region of the test set, so as to be adjacent to a strain relief engagement surface. The strain relief element includes a flange that conforms with the test set adjacent to the tunnel. As a line cord retention plug is inserted into the grooved neck portion of the line cord strain relief element and engages a wall surface of the strain relief engagement cavity, it draws the line cord strain relief element into the test set, and biases the flange against the external surface of the test set. The retention plug has a nib for manually seizing the line cord retention plug, without need for a tool for the purpose. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates in general to portable telecommunication devices, such as telephone test sets, and is particularly directed to a line cord strain relief attachment with one or more integral sealing ribs, to facilitate replacement of the line cord and provide a secure strain-relieving, enhanced weatherproof seal at the interface of the line cord with the body of the test set. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Telecommunication devices, including portable devices, such as, but not limited to telephone craftsperson&apos;s test sets, are customarily equipped with a wireline link, through which the device may be physically and electrically connected with a telecommunication port of another piece of equipment. As a non-limiting example, in the case of a standard telephone device, such a wireline communication link may be configured as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> to include a section of multi-wire cable <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, opposite ends of which are equipped with respective RJ45-style modular plugs <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, for releasably mating with an RJ45 telephone jack of the device and that of a network installation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> As further shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, in the case of a telephone test set, the line cord may also include a second multi-wire cable <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, one end of which is terminated at the RJ45 style modular plug <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that is adapted to be coupled with an associated jack of internal circuitry of the test set, and the other end of which is provided with a separate a set of (alligator) clips <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> for enabling the test set to be coupled to a variety of connection points of a telephone network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> To provide strain relief for the connection of the line cord with the telecommunication device, it has been practice to employ a physical interface having a serpentine or tortuous path for the line cord. While such a strain relief interface may provide some degree of protection for the line cord attachment of a consumer telephone device, it is wholly inadequate for a device such as a telephone test set, which will be exposed to a variety of physical hazards, including severe physical handling and the environment. This not only mandates the use of a strain relief configuration that is more robust and provides a barrier against the entry of moisture and foreign matter, but one which facilitates replacement of the line cord. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, the line cord strain relief attachment disclosed in the U.S. Pat. No. 5,755,590 (hereinafter referred to as the &apos;590 patent) successfully addresses this problem by providing a line cord and line cord attachment, diagrammatically shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. As shown therein, this improved line cord attachment, shown generally at <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, incorporates a strain relief element <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, which is configured to be sealed against the outer surface of the body of the device and coupled with an interior cavity thereof, such as the battery compartment of a test set. This improved line cord attachment and strain relief configuration not only facilitates access to and replacement of the line cord, per se, but does so without having to otherwise interfere with the main cavity of the device (test set). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> For this purpose, the telecommunication device itself includes a line cord strain relief engagement cavity <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, formed between generally flat sidewalls <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of a pair of spaced apart land portions <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> of an interior (battery) compartment <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The geometry of the strain relief engagement cavity <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is further defined by a rear wall <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and a pair of spaced apart front walls <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of respective projections <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> of the land portions <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. The front walls <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the cavity <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> have a slot <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> through which the line cord extends into the compartment <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. A fixed battery contact wall <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> has a gap <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> associated with the slot <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, so as to allow the line cord <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to pass through the fixed battery contact wall <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> to a portion of the battery compartment containing a printed wiring board. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The strain relief engagement cavity <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> communicates with an exterior surface <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> of the test set body by means of a passageway or tunnel <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. The line cord passageway <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> has non-round cross-section, for example a generally rectangular cross-section. This shape serves to prevent rotation of and is sized to snugly receive the line cord strain relief element <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the shape of which corresponds to that of the passageway <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The line cord stain relief element <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is preferably comprised of a suitable flexible and waterproof material, such as neoprene rubber, as a non-limiting example. A first end <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> of the strain relief element <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has a notched or grooved neck <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> that is insertable into the cavity <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The surface of the grooved neck portion <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> of the strain relief element <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is non-parallel with the planar surface of the rear wall of the cavity <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, so that the application of a force along the grooved neck by way of a wedge-shaped line cord retention plug <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> of hard plastic material, causes the line cord strain relief element <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to be drawn into the body of the test set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The distance between a surrounding flange <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> of the strain relief element and the grooved neck <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> of the strain relief element <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is such that insertion of the retention plug <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> into the test set cavity <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> will cause the line cord strain relief element <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to be drawn or urged into the tunnel <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, and bring the flange <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> into snug abutment against the exterior surface <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> of the test set body. Projecting from the flange <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> is a line cord shroud <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> having a longitudinal bore <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> that is sized to snugly receive the line cord <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, causing the shroud to provide a weatherproof seal around the line cord, as it extends through the strain relief element and into the test set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> To releasably secure the strain relief element <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> with the test set, the line cord retention plug <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> contains a generally rectangular T-shaped slot <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> which conforms with the grooved neck <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> of the line cord strain relief element <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. These mutually conforming shapes of the T-shaped slot <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> within retention plug <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> and the grooved neck <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> of the strain relief element <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> enable the retention plug <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> to capture the strain relief element <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, as the retention plug <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> is inserted into the cavity <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The grooved neck <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> of the strain relief element <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is inserted from outside of the test set body through the tunnel <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and into the line cord strain relief engagement cavity <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, as shown by the arrow <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>. The first end of the line cord <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is fed through the slot <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> to allow the RJ45 style modular plug <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to be plugged into an RJ45 style modular jack of the test set circuitry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The cord retention plug <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> is then inserted into the cavity <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, as shown by arrow <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight>, so that the grooved neck <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> of the strain relief element <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be is captured within the T-shaped neck of the cord retention plug <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>. The wedge shapes of the cavity <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the cord retention plug <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> push the retention plug deeper into the cavity <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, so as to cause the line cord strain relief element <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to be urged into the body of the test set, tightening the surface <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> of the flange <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> of the line cord strain relief element <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> against the exterior surface <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> of the test set, and providing a seal around the passageway <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> To replace the line cord, the cord retention plug <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> may be removed by means of a suitable tool, such as a screwdriver or the like, so that the retention plug becomes detached from the grooved neck <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> of the strain relief element <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. This frees the neck end of the strain relief element, so that the element <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be pulled out of the tunnel <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, allowing the line cord to be fully removed from the test set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Now although engagement of the flange of the line cord strain relief element of the type disclosed in the &apos;590 patent against the outer surface of the test set is intended to provide a barrier against the entry of moisture and foreign matter through the line cord passageway, it has been found that repeated subjection of the line cord strain relief attachment to a variety of deflection forces encountered in typical everyday use prevents a moisture barrier or seal from being continuously applied between the entirety of the surface of the attachment flange and the exterior surface of the test set. In addition, removal of the cord retention plug requires a suitable tool for the purpose. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, the less than perfect continuous seal functionality of the line cord strain relief attachment of the &apos;590 Patent is remedied by incorporating one or more sealing ribs or rings around the outer surface of the strain relief element. The sealing ribs are sized to provide a tight moisture and foreign matter entry barrier between the interior wall surface of the line cord-insertion tunnel and the outer surface of the strain relief element. In addition, to obviate having to use a tool to insert and/or remove the cord retention plug, the plug has a modified inverted U-shape that incorporates a nib or gripping projection, which can be readily seized between a user&apos;s thumb and forefinger, thereby allowing manual insertion and removal of the plug.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> diagrammatically illustrates a telephone craftsperson&apos;s test set that is configured to receive and sealingly engage the improved line cord strain relief attachment of the present invention. It should be observed that the invention is not limited to use with only a craftsperson&apos;s test set or one having the configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, but may be installed in other types of communication devices. Like the line cord attachment configuration of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, the telecommunication device (e.g., test set) includes a line cord strain relief engagement cavity <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, formed between generally flat sidewalls <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> of a pair of spaced apart mesas <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> at one end of an interior compartment <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> of the utility device (test set). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The strain relief engagement cavity <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is terminated by a rear wall <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> that surrounds a passageway <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> extending to an exterior surface <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> of the test set body. As in the structure of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the line cord passageway <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> has non-round cross-section, such as the generally rectangular cross-section shown, which serves to prevent rotation of and is sized to receive a line cord strain relief element <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, the cross-sectional shape of which generally corresponds to that of passageway <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The line cord stain relief element <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is preferably comprised of a suitable flexible and waterproof material, such as neoprene rubber, as a non-limiting example. A first, test set-engaging end <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight> of the strain relief element <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> has a neck portion <highlight><bold>173</bold></highlight>, having notches or grooves as shown at <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>, and is sized and shaped to be inserted through the passageway <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> and into cavity <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> As described briefly above, in accordance with the invention, the outer surface <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> of the neck portion <highlight><bold>173</bold></highlight> of the strain relief element is provided with one or more sealing ribs or rings <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight>, the functionality of which is akin to that of an O-ring as in fluid-sealing devices and applications. While the illustrated embodiment shows a pair of sealing ribs <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight>, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited thereto. A single sealing rib or three or more such rings or ribs may be employed, depending upon the application and the environment in which the utility device is to be employed. The sealing rib or ribs <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> may be formed as an integral part of the strain relief element, such as in the molding of the element, or they may be formed as separate elements, and thereafter placed upon and firmly (e.g., adhesively) affixed to the outer surface <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> of the neck portion <highlight><bold>173</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The sealing ribs <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> are sized to abut against the interior wall surface <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> of the line cord-insertion passageway <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> and thereby maintain a tight moisture and foreign matter entry seal between the interior wall surface <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> of the line cord-insertion passageway <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> and the outer surface of the neck portion strain relief element <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. As noted previously, and as will be appreciated from the architecture shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, this enhanced sealing functionality provided by the sealing ribs ensures that the intended tight moisture and foreign matter entry seal will be provided, even when the line cord strain relief attachment is subjected to the repeated deflections, that might otherwise disrupt a moisture barrier between the surface <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> of a flange <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> and the exterior surface <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> of the test set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Like the structure of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the surface of the grooved neck portion <highlight><bold>173</bold></highlight> of the strain relief element <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is non-parallel with the planar surface of the rear wall <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> of the cavity <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. As a result, the application of a plug insertion force along the grooved neck portion <highlight><bold>173</bold></highlight> by way of a generally inverted U-shaped, line cord retention plug <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> will cause the line cord strain relief element <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> to be drawn into the interior of the test set and retained against the surface of the rear wall <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The flange <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> of the line cord attachment element of the invention is configured to snugly engage the exterior surface <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> of the test set body, when the line cord strain relief element is inserted into passageway <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight>. Projecting from the flange <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> is a robustly flexible, protective line cord shroud <highlight><bold>183</bold></highlight>, shown as having an undulating surface, and including a longitudinal bore therethrough that is sized to snugly receive the line cord. The distance between the flange <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> and the grooved neck portion <highlight><bold>173</bold></highlight> of the strain relief element <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is such that insertion of the retention plug <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> into the test set cavity <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> will cause the line cord strain relief element <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> to be drawn or urged into the passageway <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight>, and thereby bring the flange <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> into snug abutment against the exterior surface <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> of the test set body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In order to releasably secure the strain relief element <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> with the test set, the line cord retention plug <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> is configured as a generally inverted U-shaped element having a pair of leg portions <highlight><bold>191</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight>, that are configured to fit into the grooves <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> in the neck portion <highlight><bold>173</bold></highlight> of the line cord strain relief element <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, and thereby enable the retention plug <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> to capture the strain relief element <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, once the retention plug <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> has been inserted into the cavity <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The U-shaped retention plug <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> is also provided with a nib or gripping projection <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight>, shown as having a ribbed &lsquo;gripping&rsquo; surface. This nib enables the line cord retention plug to be readily manually seized, as between a user&apos;s thumb and forefinger, so as to facilitate insertion and removal of the plug with respect to the grooved neck portion of the strain relief element, without the need for a separate tool. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> As will be appreciated from the foregoing description, like the line cord strain relief attachment configuration of the &apos;590 Patent, the enhanced line cord strain relief attachment configuration of the invention not only provides robust strain relief, and a barrier against moisture and foreign matter, but facilitates replacement of the line cord. The addition of one or more sealing ribs or rings around the outer surface of the strain relief element ensures that a tight moisture and foreign matter entry seal will be maintained, even when the line cord strain relief attachment is subjected to deflection forces that might otherwise disrupt the moisture barrier intended to be provided between the strain relief element flange and the exterior surface of the test set. In addition, the gripping projection allows the plug to be readily seized between a user&apos;s thumb and forefinger, thereby allowing manual insertion and removal of the plug without the need for a special tool. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> While I have shown and described an embodiment in accordance with the present invention, it is to be understood that the same is not limited thereto but is susceptible to numerous changes and modifications as are known to a person skilled in the art, and I therefore do not wish to be limited to the details shown and described herein, but intend to cover all such changes and modifications as are obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art. </paragraph>
