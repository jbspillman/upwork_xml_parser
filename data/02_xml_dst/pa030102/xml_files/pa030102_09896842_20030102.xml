<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an apparatus for precisely locating and adhering an orthodontic bracket, and more particularly to an apparatus for precisely locating an orthodontic bracket at a predetermined position on a surface of a tooth, in which orthodontic brackets for holding orthodontic wires can be easily and precisely located at and adhered to a predetermined position on a surface of a tooth, not only at an initial time but also even when the used orthodontic brackets are separated from the surface of the tooth in the course of the orthodontic treatment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In general, one&apos;s teeth are an important factor in presenting his or her external features, since their color and shape have a large effect on the image formed by the external appearance. Also, it has been known that one&apos;s teeth are an important factor in forming one&apos;s external image, since the set of teeth according to the arrangement of teeth has an effect on not only the teeth themselves but also the skeletal structure of the face. Especially, in the case of a person who has malformed set of teeth, his or her teeth not only may have an effect on his or her external appearance but also may cause inconvenience to his or her dietary life. Therefore, the correction of irregular set of teeth, or the orthodontic correction of teeth, has been considered as an important subject of medical treatment in dentistry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Under such circumstances as above, the orthodontics of the dental treatments has a long history, and the method or the technique of the orthodontics has been remarkably developed. In a conventional orthodontics, which has been widely performed until recent times, orthodontic brackets are adhered to the set or teeth, which are to be corrected, one bracket by one tooth, and then holding members respectively formed at the brackets are tied together by an orthodontic wire made from a material having a large strength, so that the irregular set of teeth is gradually corrected for a long time by the tension force of the orthodontic wire. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> However, in the conventional method as described above, since the orthodontic brackets of a predetermined size are adhered to the external side surfaces, or the labial-side surfaces, of teeth, the brackets and the orthodontic wire ligating the brackets are exposed to others&apos; eyes during the daily life of the patient who has to be placed under the orthodontic treatment, which causes a trouble in the patient&apos;s appearance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In order to overcome this problem in the external appearance, proposed has been another orthodontic treatment, which has recently been going popular, and in which the orthodontic brackets are adhered to the inner side surfaces, or the lingual side surfaces, of the teeth, and then the brackets are tied together by an orthodontic wire, so that the orthodontics is performed by the tension force of the orthodontic wire. Although the patients to be placed under the orthodontic treatment greatly prefer this orthodontic treatment since the structures for the orthodontic treatment are hidden by the patient&apos;s teeth, the doctors performing the orthodontics have much difficulty in the labors of handling the orthodontic brackets and of ligating the holding members of the brackets by the orthodontic wire. Therefore, there has been anticipated an improvement capable of settling such difficulty as above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In detailed description, the orthodontic brackets for correcting the irregular set of teeth can be adhered to at least six teeth including the front tooth and the canine tooth at each of the upper and the lower jaws. After the orthodontic brackets are firstly adhered one by one to each of the teeth, and then the holding members of the orthodontic brackets have to be tied together by a much thinner iron wire in order to ligate the holding members of the orthodontic brackets by means of the orthodontic wire made from the material having a large strength. In this case, since this labor of tying the holding members together by the thin iron wire has to be delicately carried out, careful attention and endeavor are required for each tooth and it takes relatively long time in performing the above labor and the orthodontic treatment, which inevitably causes inconvenience and difficulty to both the dentist and the patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A Korean Patent Application entitled &ldquo;Automatic lingual side ligated orthodontic bracket for correcting an irregular set of teeth&rdquo; was filed by the present applicants on the same date as the priority date of the present application. The Korean Patent Application discloses a one-touch type lingual side ligated orthodontic bracket for correcting an irregular set of teeth, which includes a base having an adhesion surface to be adhered to the lingual side surface of each tooth and a holding member for holding an orthodontic wire. In the bracket, when a handle disposed at a body of the holding member is pushed, a cover is automatically opened, so that the orthodontic wire restrained by the cover can be separated therefrom. When the apparatus of the present invention is used in combination with this one-touch type lingual side ligated orthodontic bracket for correcting an irregular set of teeth, the efficiency of the labor of correcting an irregular set of teeth can be maximized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In fact, according to the orthodontic technique in the dentistry, an original model for a patient&apos;s set of teeth is firstly made by means of a mold, and an ideal model after treating and correcting the patient&apos;s set of teeth is made on the base of the original model. Thereafter, various elements for the correction into the ideal state of the set of teeth, including adhered locations of the orthodontic brackets on the surfaces of the teeth, an arrangement of the orthodontic wire, etc., are determined, and then the real orthodontics is performed. In other words, the orthodontic brackets are made on the basis of the teeth model, and then they are applied to the patient&apos;s corresponding teeth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Further, in order to adhere the orthodontic brackets to the labial side surfaces or the lingual side surfaces of the teeth for correcting irregularities of teeth, most desired positions for seating the orthodontic brackets have to be determined and then the orthodontic brackets have to be exactly adhered onto the positions. However, these labors are by no means easy, require a careful endeavor, and are relatively time-exhaustive. Moreover, when one orthodontic bracket or several orthodontic brackets are separated from the surfaces of the teeth while the orthodontic treatment is in progress, much further endeavor and attention are required in adhering them to the original positions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In the orthodontic treatment, to locate the orthodontic brackets at exact positions on the surfaces of teeth is an important factor in order to obtain a successful result of treatment. Especially, in the case of the lingual side orthodontic treatment, in which the exact location of the orthodontic brackets has a large influence on the treatment, usually used is an indirect bonding method, in which the orthodontic brackets are adhered to ideal positions on well-arranged teeth model and then the positions of the orthodontic brackets are exactly transferred to the patient&apos;s teeth, rather than a direct bonding method, in which the orthodontic brackets are directly adhered to the surfaces of the teeth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Among the existing apparatuses used in the indirect bonding method, when a material of silicon or rubber is used, it is difficult to exactly locate the orthodontic brackets due to the elasticity of the material. When a solid resin is used, the positions of the orthodontic brackets can be exactly transferred, but it is impossible to adhere the orthodontic brackets again when the orthodontic brackets have been separated from the surfaces of the teeth once used. Further, although it is possible to manufacture an apparatus capable of re-adhering the orthodontic brackets simultaneously while using the resin, there are several problems in this apparatus, in that the orthodontic brackets may be separated from the apparatus for adhesion while the bonding is carried out and it is difficult to adhere the orthodontic brackets again to the exact positions once separated, since the apparatus for adhesion and the orthodontic brackets are assembled together only by means of a frictional force. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Therefore, there has been a request for a method or an apparatus of guiding the orthodontic brackets to be rapidly and easily located at precise positions, when the orthodontic brackets are initially adhered to the surfaces of teeth requiring the orthodontic correction, and when the separated orthodontic brackets are adhered again. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The above and other objects, characteristics, and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following description along with the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, provided is an apparatus for precisely locating an orthodontic bracket at a predetermined position on a surface of a tooth. The apparatus of the invention includes a suspension body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a ring <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and a molding spacer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. In this case, the orthodontic bracket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is a ligated bracket for an orthodontic correction of teeth, which includes a base member <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> having an adhesion surface <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> to be adhered to a surface of the tooth, and a holding member <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and a hook <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, which are integrated with the base member <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and respectively protrude upward and inward of an oral cavity as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A and IB. The holding member <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> is a member to hold and to be ligated by an orthodontic wire (not shown) for correcting irregular set of teeth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In the meantime, the suspension body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the apparatus according to the invention is disposed extending in parallel with a tooth <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> from an apex <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> toward a dental root <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> of the tooth <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> with a predetermined gap. Further, the suspension body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has an inner surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, at a lower end of which is formed an fitting recess <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and an outer surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, on a lower portion of which is formed a groove <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In this case, the fitting recess <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has a concave contour complementary to the contour of the holding member <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, so that the holding member <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> can be fittedly inserted in the fitting recess <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The ring <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is made from an elastic material and functions to tighten the suspension body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the orthodontic bracket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> together. That is, when the holding member <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> has been fittedly inserted in the fitting recess <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the ring <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is inserted in the groove <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and hooked around the hook <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, so as to tightly assemble the suspension body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the orthodontic bracket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The molding spacer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is disposed between the suspension body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the tooth <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The molding spacer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> has first and second surfaces <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. The first surface <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> has a concave contour complementary to the contour of the region R, which includes an apex <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and upper portions of a labial surface <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and a lingual surface <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> of the tooth <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, so that the molding spacer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can be fittedly placed on the top of the tooth <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Also, the second surface <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> has a contour complementary to a concave contour of the inner surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the suspension body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, so that the suspension body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be fittedly placed on the molding spacer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Therefore, when the molding spacer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> has been fittedly placed on the top of the tooth <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the suspension body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has been fittedly placed on the molding spacer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the molding spacer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can provide a stable support for the suspension body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> without a detail movement of the suspension body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, to thereby enable the suspension body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to precisely locate the orthodontic bracket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> at a predetermined position on the lingual surface <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> of the tooth <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that the molding spacer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is made from synthetic resin, that the elastic ring <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is made from rubber, and that the orthodontic bracket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is a lingual side orthodontic bracket for the teeth of upper and lower jaws. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In the apparatus of the present invention, since there is provided the molding spacer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> having a concave contour complementary to the contour of the corresponding tooth, even when the orthodontic bracket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is separated from the surface of the tooth due to such a cause as a poor adhesion during the orthodontic treatment, it can be placed again at the original position without any difficulty. Therefore, it is preferred that the apparatus of the invention is separately stored, since it is necessary not only for adhering the orthodontic bracket when the orthodontic treatment is initiated but also for re-adhering the orthodontic bracket when it is separated in the course of the treatment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The apparatus of the invention is an apparatus for an indirect boning, made from resin or plastic, so as to precisely transfer the relation between the tooth and the orthodontic bracket. In this indirect bonding apparatus, since the orthodontic bracket is tightly assembled with the apparatus by mean of a rubber ring or an assembling pin, the orthodontic bracket can be easily detached and assembled again. It is apparent that this assembling method may be applied to not only the lingual side orthodontic bracket as described above but also a general labial side orthodontic bracket or tube. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, the function and working effect by the apparatus of the invention will be described, with reference to the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Firstly, a molding spacer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> having a concave contour complementary to that of a tooth in question and a suspension body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> having a size capable of locating the orthodontic bracket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> at a desired position on the tooth are arranged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Then, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference>, the holding member <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> is fittedly inserted in the fitting recess <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and then the ring <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is inserted in the groove <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and hooked around the hook <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, so that the orthodontic bracket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is tightly assembled with the suspension body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In this case, since the fitting recess <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has a concave contour complementary to the contour of the holding member <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, the suspension body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the orthodontic bracket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are fittedly assembled without a minute relative movement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The lingual surface <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> of the tooth <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, to which the orthodontic bracket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is to be adhered, is prepared for bonding as usual. If desired for additional bond strength, the adhesion surface <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of the base member <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> can be sandblasted. Then, an adhesive is applied to the adhesion surface <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of the orthodontic bracket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, the molding spacer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is fittedly placed on the area R of the molding spacer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and the suspension body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is fittedly placed on the molding spacer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, so that the orthodontic bracket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is precisely located at the predetermined position on the orthodontic bracket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Then, the orthodontic bracket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is pressed onto the lingual surface <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, and excessive bonding material is removed before the adhesive sets. After the adhesive has set, the suspension body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the molding spacer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are removed. The removed the suspension body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the molding spacer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are stored for the case where they are necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</cross-reference>, the inner surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the suspension body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is spaced apart from the lingual surface <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> of the tooth <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> with a predetermined gap, into which the auto-polymerizing resin is filled to transfer the contour of the tooth. In this case, there is arranged a small interval between the tooth side portion and the bracket side portion, through which excessive adhesive leaking when the adhesion surface <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is adhered to the lingual surface <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> can be drained instead of being introduced toward the lingual surface <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> of the tooth <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. FIG <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. shows an assembled state of the apparatus of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</cross-reference> show an apparatus according to another embodiment of the present invention, which is used for an orthodontic bracket for a premolar tooth of an upper jaw or a lower jaw, manufactured by Ormco/&ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, located at 1717 W. Collins, Orange, Calif. 82867, U.S.A. Although the basic construction of this apparatus is similar to that of an apparatus for the front teeth, the concave contour of the fitting recess and the position of the groove change according to the shape of the used orthodontic bracket. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>B show an apparatus according to another embodiment of the present invention, which is used for a labial orthodontic bracket, and in which the labial orthodontic bracket is assembled with the suspension body by means of an assembling pin instead of the rubber ring. The thickness of the pin changes according to the size of the slot of the used orthodontic bracket. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In this apparatus, the orthodontic bracket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> does not have the hook <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> but has the holding member <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> extending in a shape of letter Y, and the fitting recess <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the suspension body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has a concave contour complementary to the shape of the holding member <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and slots formed both sides thereof, through which a pin can be inserted. After the holding member <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> is inserted in the fitting recess <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the pin is inserted through the slots to stably and firmly assemble the suspension body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the orthodontic bracket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> together. When the pin is drawn out, the suspension body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the orthodontic bracket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be easily and simply separated from each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> This construction can be employed also in an orthodontic tube, which can be assembled with a suspension body by a pin inserted through slots. Likewise, when the pin is drawn out, the orthodontic tube and the suspension body can be easily separated from each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</cross-reference> show an apparatus for indirect bonding according to another embodiment of the present invention, which is used for Huzida&apos;s lingual orthodontic bracket, which is similar to the Ormco&apos;s apparatus for indirect bonding for front teeth orthodontic bracket but a concave contour complementary to Huzida&apos;s orthodontic bracket and a groove for an O-ring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The apparatus of the invention may be used together with the automatic lingual side ligated orthodontic bracket, which was filed in the Korean Patent Property Office (KIPO) on the same date as the priority date of the present application. In this case, the orthodontic treatment can have a multiplied effect. </paragraph>
