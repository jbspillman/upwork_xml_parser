<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">An improved rack-mounted server comprises, in one embodiment, a slidable electronics tray having a top cover secured to the rack, to facilitate access to the tray when it is withdrawn from the rack. The tray also includes a camming mechanism to facilitate insertion of the tray into and its extraction from cable connectors or plugs affixed to the rack. The tray includes, in one embodiment, a movement detection mechanism to power it up or down when tray insertion or removal, respectively, is initiated. In addition, the rack includes an improved cable management system that can acconmmodate different cables and cable plugs. As a tray is inserted into or removed from the rack, corresponding connectors on the tray are electrically coupled to or uncoupled from cable plugs affixed to the rack, eliminating any need to remove cables from the tray or reinstall them. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to electronics packaging. More particularly, the present invention relates to an improved rack-mounted server that facilitates access to and/or replacement of electronics trays, and to methods of use thereof. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Computer networks, such as the Internet, utilize high performance computer systems called &ldquo;servers&rdquo;. Servers typically have high performance processors and contain hardware and software capable of handling large amounts of data. Servers provide a large number of computer users with access to large stores of information. For example, servers are used to host web sites that can be accessed by many computers via the Internet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> One or more server components are often housed within a server housing or &ldquo;server rack&rdquo;. Server racks are typically box-like structures or cabinets that contain a number of removable electronic modules or electronic trays (&ldquo;e-trays&rdquo;). Each e-tray can be a different server, or each e-tray can hold one or more components of a server. Server components can include modules, for example, for processors, disk drives (such as floppy disk drives, hard drives, compact disk or CD drives, and digital video disk or DVD drives), random access memory (RAM), network interfaces and controllers, SCSI (small computer systems interface) bus controllers, video controllers, parallel and serial ports, power supplies, and so forth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a perspective view of a portion of a prior art server rack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and electronics tray <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. E-tray <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be a box-like housing having metal side panels <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a top panel or cover <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, a bottom panel or base (not shown), and a front panel <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. These panels help to reduce the effect of potentially harmful electromagnetic interference (EMI), and to minimize the impact of various environmental factors such as dust. When a prior art e-tray <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is removed from a server rack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for servicing, it is necessary to remove the cover <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> prior to servicing and to replace the cover <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> after servicing. This is a time-consuming operation with respect to relatively expensive equipment that is normally expected to operate with a minimum of down-time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The various server components are electrically and functionally interconnected via wires or cables. Generally, in the prior art there are many cables coming out of at least one side, and sometimes several sides, of the server rack. Cables typically have an end connector or &ldquo;cable plug&rdquo; that fastens to a corresponding electrical &ldquo;receptacle&rdquo; on the e-tray. The cable plug and receptacle can be male, female, or another type of connector. Each e-tray can have multiple receptacles that require connection to corresponding multiple cable plugs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Cable management&rdquo; is the implementation of a system whose object is to control the arrangement of the plethora of power and signal cables that run into and out of an electronic housing, such as a server rack. Many known server racks include dozens of cables in unsightly, disorganized, and potentially dangerous states of disarray. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> As mentioned earlier, servers and their components, which are contained in e-trays, are expected to be highly reliable. When a server component requires servicing, the amount of time and effort expended in removing the e-tray should be kept to a minimum, and the same is true when the e-tray is ready to be reinserted into the server rack. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> When a prior art e-tray is removed from a server rack, the service person may neglect to first power-down the e-tray. This can result in harmful arcing across the terminals of power supply connectors, to the extent that the terminals are often fused and will need to be replaced, thus incurring even more time and effort before the e-tray can be reinserted into the server rack. In addition, the service person can be exposed to potentially hazardous conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> For the reasons stated above, and for other reasons stated below which will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon reading and understanding the present specification, there is a significant need in the art for improved rack-mounted servers and methods of making such equipment.</paragraph>

Switch arm <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is coupled to switch <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> via a switch shaft <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> that passes through aperture <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> in the front panel <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and connects with switch <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. Switch <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> can be any of suitable type, such as a micro-switch. In other embodiments, switch <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> can be actuated by any other appropriate kind of movement sensor, such as a magnetic element, pneumatic element, pressure transducer, light-beam interrupter, radio-frequency (RF) device, or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> While switch <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is shown close to handle <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in the embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, in other embodiments, the movement sensor or switch could be located on the handle <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> itself, elsewhere on the e-tray, or elsewhere in the server rack. For example, it could be located at the rear of the e-tray. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Switch <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is coupled via a link <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> to a power-up/power-down circuit <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. Link <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> can be of any suitable type, such as an electrically conductive bus or cable, fiber optic cable, RF or infrared link, or the like, depending in part upon the type of switch <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> employed. Switch <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> transmits an &ldquo;E-Tray In&rdquo; signal via link <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> when handle <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is in the filly upright position, and switch <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> transmits an &ldquo;E-Tray Out&rdquo; signal when handle <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has been moved from the filly upright position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Power-up/power-down circuit <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is coupled to power supply <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. Power-up/power-down circuit <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is responsive to the E-Tray In signal to initiate a power-up sequence, coupling electrical power having the proper parameters to the electrical component(s) on the e-tray. Likewise, power-up/power-down circuit <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is responsive to the E-Tray Out signal to initiate a power-down sequence, uncoupling electrical power from the electrical component(s) on the e-tray. It is well within the skill of those of ordinary skill in the art to design an appropriate power-up/power-down circuit <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The response characteristics of power-up/power-down circuit <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> can be tuned so that a power-down sequence is initiated within a very short time after handle <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is pulled, e.g. within 300 milliseconds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> By ensuring that power is not turned on while the e-tray is inserted or removed, the potential for damage to electronic components on the e-tray and/or to the connector terminals of receptacles and cable plugs (such as those illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>) is substantially reduced. In addition, because it is impossible to remove the e-tray without shutting down the power, the margin of safety for operational personnel is enhanced, which is particularly important for e-trays whose top covers remain in the server rack when the e-trays are removed. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Conclusion </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides for a server rack having a plurality of e-trays that can be easily, quickly, and safely removed and reinserted. Embodiments have been disclosed in which the e-tray top is affixed to the server rack, so that it does not have to be removed and replaced when the e-tray is withdrawn for inspection, repair, replacement, and/or upgrade. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Also, by providing an automatic power-down facility, an e-tray that is withdrawn by a repair person without first powering it down does not sustain potential damage to its connector terminals or to its electronic components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Further, by providing a cable management solution that enables e-trays to be removed and replaced without associated time-consuming removal and replacement of wires and cables, the performance of the server equipment is substantially enhanced, and it is therefore more commercially attractive. The cable management solution described herein provides a persistent interface that virtually constitutes an input/output socket at the system level, substantially facilitating the insertion and removal of electronic modules into an electronic assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> As shown herein, the present invention can be implemented in a number of different embodiments. Other embodiments will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. The elements, materials, geometries, dimensions, and sequence of operations can all be varied to suit particular server rack and e-tray requirements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The invention should not be construed as restricted to server racks, and it may find application in any type of electronic assembly structure. For example, it can be used for telecommunications equipment, power industry equipment, industrial equipment, radio and television broadcasting equipment, aerospace and military equipment, maritime equipment, automotive equipment, and personal entertainment equipment (e.g., televisions, radios, stereos, tape and compact disc players, video cassette recorders, MP3 (Motion Picture Experts Group, Audio Layer 3) players, etc.), and the like. Thus, as used herein, the terms &ldquo;server rack&rdquo; or &ldquo;electronics rack assembly&rdquo; are intended to mean any type of electronic assembly structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Further, the terms &ldquo;electronics tray&rdquo; and &ldquo;e-tray&rdquo; are intended to mean any type of electronic modules, such as removable electronics boards, panels, cards, or other types of electronic modules. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> While cable plugs are described herein as located on the server rack, and receptacles are described as located on the e-trays, the inverse could also be implemented in other embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> While a top panel has been described as being fixed in the rack, in another embodiment, the bottom panel could be fixed, and the e-tray could be inverted for example. Also, while a separate power-down mechanism for each e-tray has been disclosed, in another embodiment a single power-down mechanism could be provided for the entire server rack or a portion thereof using, for example, a light beam arrangement to detect any withdrawal and accordingly to shut down the entire server rack or portion thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The terms &ldquo;top&rdquo;, &ldquo;bottom&rdquo;, &ldquo;front&rdquo;, and &ldquo;back&rdquo; are to be understood as relative terms, and it should be understood that the scope of the invention includes corresponding elements in structures that may be inverted or turned end-for-end relative to those shown in the figures and described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The above-described choice of materials, geometry, structure, and assembly operations can all be varied by one of ordinary skill in the art to optimize the accessibility of server racks and e-trays and to minimize the time required to inspect, repair, and/or replace e-trays. The particular implementation of the invention is very flexible in terms of the orientation, size, number, and composition of its constituent elements. Various embodiments of the invention can be implemented using any one or more of various geometrical and functional arrangements of e-tray covers, power-up/power-down mechanisms, insertion/removal mechanisms, and cable management systems to achieve the advantages of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> The figures are merely representational and are not drawn to scale. Certain proportions thereof may be exaggerated, while others may be minimized. FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are intended to illustrate various implementations of the invention that can be understood and appropriately carried out by those of ordinary skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Although specific embodiments have been illustrated and described herein, it will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that any arrangement that is calculated to achieve the same purpose may be substituted for the specific embodiment shown. This application is intended to cover any adaptations or variations of the present invention. Therefore, it is manifestly intended that this invention be limited only by the claims and the equivalents thereof. </paragraph>
