<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">Test structure circuitry and apparatus, circuit boards, and testing systems are described, as well as methods to form such apparatus and circuit boards. The test structure apparatus is used for launching high frequency signals from a test instrument, such as a Time Domain Reflectometer (TDR), into circuitry under test, and includes a pair of launching conductors and a ground pad formed on the first surface of a substrate, or dielectric layer. A ground plane layer, formed on the second surface of the dielectric layer, is connected to the ground pad, which is typically formed so as to substantially surround some portion of the launching conductors. The test structure provides a matching impedance between the TDR probe tip, for example, and the circuit board or components under test. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to testing and characterizing circuit boards, as well as the components mounted thereon. More particularly, the present invention relates to apparatus and methods which are used to characterize and test the performance of printed circuit boards and various components using a differential signal interface at frequencies above about one Gigahertz. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND INFORMATION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> As circuit design clock speeds increase, and data rates approach one billion transfers per second, the radio frequency properties of each signal as it crosses a circuit board become all-important. Because high-speed signals traveling along a transmission line tend to reflect energy backward (toward their source) as they encounter a change in impedance, and the amount of reflected energy depends on the magnitude of the impedance change, it is often the reflected energy due to impedance changes that makes the difference between a circuit that works and one that does not. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Within conventional dynamic RAM circuits, a single data bit or pulse typically travels down a bus transmission line alone, and reaches its destination, such that any reflections caused by an impedance mismatch dissipate before the next bit is launched. In higher data rate environments, this is not necessarily the case. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> For example, in some recent data bus circuitry designs, data is transported so rapidly that up to three bits of information may be in transit between a source and the destination along a particular circuit trace (such as between a memory controller and the memory it operates) at a given instant in time. At such speeds, the second and third bits must pass through any reflections generated by the first bit due to an impedance mismatch, such as that which may occur at the junction where the bit enters a connector. Such reflections degrade signal margins and cause timing errors, leading to data transmission failures. Therefore, in these high-speed signal propagation situations, it is absolutely essential to minimize impedance variations encountered within the circuit board and data processing circuitry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> One way of verifying the impedance characteristics of a particular component is to observe signal reflections from the component when high speed test signals are launched onto the associated circuit board. Test &ldquo;coupons&rdquo; (sample test areas) are therefore incorporated into circuit board designs to facilitate connection to impedance measurement tools. Such coupons are used to verify behavior of the printed circuit board (PCB) itself, as well as various attached circuit packages, sockets, and connectors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The industry-standard tool used for circuit board impedance measurements is the Time Domain Reflectometer (TDR). TDR instruments make use of fast system risetimes and a high bandwidth to resolve features of circuit boards and their attached circuitry. A TDR typically takes measurements by using a probe to send a known pulse down the transmission medium (in this case a circuit board trace or differential pair of traces) and capturing the reflections that result. The heart of the TDR is an extremely high-bandwidth (20 GHz) sampling oscilloscope and fast-risetime sampling head with an integral step generator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Therefore, in setting up for actual circuit board impedance measurements, the TDR probing approach is of great concern. Impedance matching is critical. In dense high-speed circuit areas, the space available to firmly attach a TDR probe is very limited. Yet probe connection integrity is essential. Any compromise in these areas will inevitably appear as an inaccurate TDR reading. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> SMA connectors are sometimes used to couple TDR equipment to the circuit board for testing. However, this type of connector installation is usually less than satisfactory, since it contributes to an impedance mismatch between the probe and the PCB, and usually requires about one square inch of board surface area for attachment. Thus, the use of SMA connectors is often not an option for the designer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Specially-designed microprobes are also available for TDR measurement applications. However, the conventional microprobe contact connection also contributes to impedance mismatch at high frequencies, such that microprobes are also less than ideal as a signal coupling device for test signals above about one Gigahertz. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Another difficulty involves launching differential test signals into a particular circuit or board design. With differential signals, two conductors are required: the first carries a true signal value, while the second carries the inverted signal value. Ideally, the differential system leads to complete cancellation of emitted noise. The receiver then rejects common-mode noise, and the result is a substantial improvement in both signaling speed and reduced emissions due to electromagnetic interference. High-speed designs tend to incorporate differential signaling, rather than single-ended methods, because higher data rates are possible, susceptibility to EMI is less, and power consumption is also typically less. However the problems encountered when testing high-speed differential interfaces are in effect doubled with regard to impedance mismatch problems and connector surface area requirements. While some approaches have been tested for launching single-ended, high-speed signals into circuit boards for testing purposes, no uniformly satisfactory apparatus or method is known for the convenient application of high-speed differential signals necessary to properly characterize high-speed differential interface circuitry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Thus, there is a need in the art for test structure apparatus and methods which can be easily applied to launch differential test signals into circuit boards and components for high-speed signal performance characterization purposes. Such apparatus and methods should provide an optimal impedance match to minimize reflections, while using a minimum of circuit board real estate for connection to the circuitry under test.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which are shown by way of illustration, and not of limitation, specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. In the drawings, like numerals describe substantially similar components throughout the several views. The embodiments illustrated are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized and derived therefrom, such that structural, logical, and electrical circuit substitutions and changes may be made without departing from the scope of the invention. The following detailed description, therefore, is not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the invention is defined only by the appended claims, along with the full range of equivalents to which such claims are entitled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> According to the teachings of the present invention, a test structure apparatus is described. The test structure generally includes a mirrored pair of launching conductors and a ground pad formed on the first surface of a substrate, or dielectric layer. A ground plane layer, formed on the second surface of the dielectric layer, is connected to the ground pad, which is typically formed so as to substantially surround some portion of the launching conductors. The test structure provides a matching impedance between a differential signal TDR probe tip, for example, and the circuit board or components under test. Advantages provided by this invention include minimal impedance discontinuity at high frequencies, and a total connection board surface area requirement that is about one-sixteenth that required by a single SMA connector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> top, plan view of a test structure constructed according to the teachings of the present invention can be seen. The test structure <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a substrate or dielectric layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> with a first surface <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The dielectric layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is typically of the type used for FR-4 circuit board material, and can be made from a fluororesin, a polynorbornene resin, a benzocyclobutene resin, a polyimide resin, an epoxy resin, or some combination of these. However, the dielectric layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> may also be made of many other types of relatively non-conductive materials, including various natural materials, such as rubber, or synthetic materials, including plastics and polymers. A ground pad <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> is formed within a region on the first surface <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and electrically connected to a ground plane layer adjacent the second surface (see elements <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, respectively, described hereinbelow) of the dielectric layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, typically using a plurality of through-hole vias <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight>. The ground pad preferably includes a groove <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> which, as will be discussed below, may be formed in a number of ways. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> A first and second launching conductor <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> are also formed adjacent the first surface <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Each one of the launching conductors <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> is typically disposed on the first surface <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> outside of the region bearing the ground pad <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>, in the form of an &ldquo;open funnel&rdquo;, as a mirror image of the other. For example, as can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the second launching conductor <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> is formed as a mirror image of the first launching conductor <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> as reflected about the axis of a center line <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Several dimensional features relative to constructing an operational version of the test structure <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> will now be discussed. It should be noted that the absolute value of the dimensions given, while useful in a particular impedance matching situation, are only a guide to many possible implementations of the invention. That is, the dimensions and relative size of various elements of the invention may be scaled up or down to adjust the impedance of the differential interface as desired in a particular testing configuration, as is well known to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> For example, to provide a differential impedance of approximately 100 ohms for the test structure <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the ground pad <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> may have a length <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> of about 5.1 millimeters (mm), or about 0.2 inches (in.), which includes the depth <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> of the groove <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and length <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> of the receding portions <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> (about 2.5 mm/0.1 in. and about 1.3 mm/0.05 in., respectively), plus the length <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> of the ground pad <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> base (about 1.3 mm/0.05 in.). The ground pad <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> may have a total height of about 4.3 mm/0.17 in., which includes the width <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> of the arms <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> (about 1.3 mm/0.05 in. each), and the width <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> of the groove <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, which is about 1.8 mm/0.07 in. The ends <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> of the arms <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> have a width <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> of about 1.5 mm/0.059 in., which includes the receding portions <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> of the arms <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the dimensions of the ground pad <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> described above, the first and second launching conductors <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> are typically formed to have a substantially uniform width and are separated from each other by a greater or first separation distance <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> of less than about 1.3 mm/0.05 in., and more preferably, by about 1.1 mm/0.042 in. The conductors <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> are separated from each other by a lesser or second separation distance <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> of greater than about 0.05 mm/0.002 in., and preferably, by about 0.15 mm/0.006 in. The inlet portion <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> formed by the mirrored pair of transmitting ends <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> of each one of the first and second launching conductors <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> is disposed within the groove <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> so as to be substantially evenly surrounded by the groove <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. In other words, the spacing <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> between the transmitting ends <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> and the throat <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> should be about 0.15 mm/0.006 in. in this example, and the spacing <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> between the transmitting ends <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> and the arms <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> should also be about 0.15 mm/0.006 in. However, proximate to the transition portion <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight>, which includes the substantially non-parallel, mirrored pair of tapered segments <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> of the launching conductors <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>, the groove <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> preferably includes receding portions <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> attached to the arms <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>, which are spaced apart from the launching conductors <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> by a separation distance <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> of about 0.15 mm/0.006 in. where the transmitting ends <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> join the tapered segments <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, and recede away to a separation distance <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> of about 0.38 mm/0.015 in. at the ends <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> of the arms <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>. Finally, the first and second launching conductors <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> typically include an outlet portion <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> formed by the mirrored pair of receiving ends <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> which have a length <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> of about 12.7 mm/0.5 in. As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the pair of transmitting ends <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> is joined to the pair of receiving ends <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> by the pair of tapered segments <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> side, plan view of the test structure illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> can be seen. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the test structure <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> includes the dielectric layer <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>, with a first surface <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and a second surface <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>. Adjacent the second surface is a ground plane layer <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, having a typical thickness of at least about 0.02 mm/0.001 in., or more. However, the absolute thickness of the ground plane layer <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> is not critical for performance of the test structure <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The dielectric layer <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> has a substantially uniform thickness <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> of about 0.13 mm/0.005 in., which is typically scaled to thicknesses <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> of about 0.05 mm/0.002 in. to about 0.2 mm/0.008 in. Those skilled in the art will realize that changing the thickness <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> of the dielectric layer also affects the differential impedance presented by the test structure <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The launching conductors, of which only the second launching conductor <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> (see also elements <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), are typically formed so as to have a substantially uniform thickness <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight> of about 0.3 mm/0.012 in., which is typically scaled to thicknesses <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight> of about 0.025 mm/0.001 in. to about 0.05 mm/0.002 in. Similarly, the ground pad <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> is formed so as to have a substantially uniform thickness <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> of about 0.3 mm/0.012 in., which is scaled to thicknesses <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> of about 0.025 mm/0.001 in. to about 0.05 mm/0.002 in., and which may be selected to be substantially equal to the thickness <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight> of the launching conductor <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> (and elements <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> can also be seen a side view of one of the vias <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight> by which the ground pad <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> may be connected to the ground plane layer <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>. The test structure <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may include one or more other layers <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> as an integral part of its construction, which layers <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> may be conducting or non-conducting, as desired and appropriate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> top, plan view of a single launching conductor element constructed according to the teachings of the present invention can be seen. The launching conductor <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> may be similar to or identical to the first launching conductor <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, and similar to or identical to the mirror image of the second launching conductor <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> (also shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). Typically, each launching conductor <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> is formed so as to have a substantially uniform width, such that the width <highlight><bold>346</bold></highlight> of the transmitting end or first conductive segment <highlight><bold>351</bold></highlight> is substantially equal to the width <highlight><bold>347</bold></highlight> of the tapered segment <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight>, which in turn is substantially equal to the width <highlight><bold>348</bold></highlight> of the receiving end or second conductive segment <highlight><bold>353</bold></highlight>. For testing using the 100 ohm differential impedance discussed previously, the widths <highlight><bold>346</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>347</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>348</bold></highlight> are preferably selected to be about 0.2 mm/0.008 in., which is typically scaled from about 0.1 mm/0.004 in. to about 0.3 mm/0.012 in. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The launching conductors <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> are usually formed with the first conductive segment <highlight><bold>351</bold></highlight> terminated by a first substantially obtuse angular connection <highlight><bold>375</bold></highlight> to one end <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> of the tapered segment <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight>. In turn, the second conductive segment <highlight><bold>353</bold></highlight> is usually formed so as to be substantially parallel to the first conductive segment <highlight><bold>351</bold></highlight>, such that the second conductive segment <highlight><bold>353</bold></highlight> is terminated by a second substantially obtuse angular connection <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> to the other end <highlight><bold>355</bold></highlight> of the tapered segment <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight>. It should be noted that tapering the spacing of the launching conductor <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> toward the axis of the centerline <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>, using the tapered segment <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight>, is necessary to preserve the continuity of the impedance throughout the length of the segments <highlight><bold>351</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>353</bold></highlight>. It should also be noted that, since the launching conductors <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> are typically formed as paired mirror images about the axis of the center line <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> (refer to elements <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), the transmitting end <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>351</bold></highlight> of the first launching conductor <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> will typically lie in the plane of the first surface <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> so as to be substantially parallel to the transmitting end <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>351</bold></highlight> of the second launching conductor <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>, at the same time as the receiving end <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>353</bold></highlight> of the first launching conductor <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> lies in the plane of the first surface <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> so as to be substantially parallel to the receiving end <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>353</bold></highlight> of the second launching conductor <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> While the first and second substantially obtuse angles <highlight><bold>375</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> are usually selected to be substantially equal, ranging from about 95 degrees to about 175 degrees, this is not necessarily the case. Each of the substantially obtuse angles <highlight><bold>375</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> may differ from the other, if desired. However, the first substantially obtuse angle <highlight><bold>375</bold></highlight> in one of the launching conductors <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> (e.g. element <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) will almost always be equal to the first substantially obtuse angle <highlight><bold>375</bold></highlight> in the other (mirror image) launching conductor <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> (e.g. element <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). Similarly, the second substantially obtuse angle <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> in one of the launching conductors <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> will also almost always be equal to the second substantially obtuse angle <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> in the other (mirror image) launching conductor <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>. In any case, the linear length <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight> along the &ldquo;X&rdquo; direction of the launching conductor will of course change as the angles <highlight><bold>375</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> are changed, while the linear lengths <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>341</bold></highlight> of the segments <highlight><bold>351</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>353</bold></highlight>, respectively, will remain relatively unchanged. With reference to the exemplary dimensions discussed previously, the linear length <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight> of the launching conductor <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> will be about 17.8 mm/0.7 in., with scaling linear length <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight> values from about 2.5 mm/0.1 in. to about 23 mm/0.9 in. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, it should be noted that a circuit board <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> may also be constructed according to the teachings of the present invention. The circuit board <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> includes a substantially planar dielectric layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> having a first surface <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and a second surface <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). The circuit board <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> also includes a ground plane layer <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) fixedly attached to the second surface <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>, and a ground pad <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> fixedly attached to the first surface. The ground pad <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> is typically connected to the ground plane layer <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> using one or more vias <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight>. The circuit board <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> also includes first and second launching conductors <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight>) adjacent the first surface <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and formed with an inlet portion <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> joined to an outlet portion <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> by a tapered portion <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight>. As described previously, the second launching conductor <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> is typically formed as a mirror image of the first launching conductor <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> about the axis of the center line <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. Further, the ground pad <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> of the circuit board <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> usually includes a groove <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> which is formed such that the inlet portion <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> formed by the transmitting ends <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> of the first and second launching conductors <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight>) is disposed substantially within the groove <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> top plan view of a circuit board and testing system constructed according to the teachings of the present invention can be seen. Here the circuit board <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, which includes a ground pad <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> and launching conductors <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>455</bold></highlight> formed adjacent the first surface <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, also has a plurality of conductive elements <highlight><bold>485</bold></highlight>, similar to or identical to integrated circuit through-hole pads or surface mounting pads, or circuit wiring traces, adjacent the first surface <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. The circuit board <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> also includes a circuit <highlight><bold>495</bold></highlight> electrically connected to the conductive elements <highlight><bold>485</bold></highlight>, typically using one or more leads <highlight><bold>490</bold></highlight>. The circuit <highlight><bold>495</bold></highlight> may be a receiver circuit, a driver circuit, a connector, a socket, a microprocessor, or a memory circuit, all of which are well known to those skilled in the art. For trace characterization purposes, the circuit <highlight><bold>495</bold></highlight> may even include a receiving test structure <highlight><bold>497</bold></highlight> constructed according to the teachings of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Thus, a testing system <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> may also be constructed and operated according to the teachings of the present invention, and includes a test structure <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, which is similar to or identical to the test structure <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The testing system <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> also includes a microprobe <highlight><bold>461</bold></highlight> that has a differential signal output <highlight><bold>466</bold></highlight>, which includes a positive signal lead <highlight><bold>462</bold></highlight> and a negative signal lead <highlight><bold>463</bold></highlight>. The microprobe also has a signal ground <highlight><bold>464</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In use, the microprobe differential signal output <highlight><bold>466</bold></highlight> is operationally connected or coupled to the inlet portion formed by the transmitting ends <highlight><bold>451</bold></highlight> of the first and second launching conductors <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>455</bold></highlight>, while the signal ground <highlight><bold>464</bold></highlight> is operationally connected or coupled to the ground pad <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> (as well as to the ground plane, typically by way of one or more vias <highlight><bold>465</bold></highlight>). As a matter of clarification, it is particularly easy to see in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> that the inlet portion formed by the transmitting ends <highlight><bold>451</bold></highlight> of the first and second launching conductors <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>455</bold></highlight> (formed as an &ldquo;open funnel&rdquo; shape) are substantially disposed within the groove <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> of the ground pad <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> A TDR instrument <highlight><bold>484</bold></highlight>, similar to or identical to a Tektronix 11801C with an SD-24 TDR sampling head, is used to launch a differential signal <highlight><bold>488</bold></highlight>, typically having a frequency within a range of about 1 Gigahertz to about 20 Gigahertz, or higher, into the microprobe <highlight><bold>461</bold></highlight>. If the test structure <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, has been scaled appropriately (such that the structure <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is constructed and adapted to receive the differential signal <highlight><bold>488</bold></highlight>), the differential signal <highlight><bold>488</bold></highlight> will propagate into the test structure <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> with a minimum of impedance discontinuity, such that the reflected signal from the circuit <highlight><bold>495</bold></highlight>, which might be a connector for example, will truly reveal the ability of the circuit <highlight><bold>495</bold></highlight> differential interface to properly handle high frequency signals, such as the differential signal <highlight><bold>488</bold></highlight>, as observed on the display <highlight><bold>486</bold></highlight>. It should be noted that during laboratory testing, the impedance discontinuity contributed by a test structure fabricated according to the teachings of the invention was measured to be on the order of five ohms or less. This is clearly better than results typically obtained using a through-hole mounted SMA connector, which often introduces an impedance discontinuity of about 10-15 ohms (and requires on the order of 16-32 times the amount of circuit board surface area for connecting the probe). While edge-mounted SMA connectors may be used to launch high frequency test signals with impedance discontinuities on the order of a few ohms, they still require a great deal of precious circuit board real estate for probe attachment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> It should also be noted that the testing system <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> can be used to characterize the performance of traces on the circuit board <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> itself. As mentioned previously, the circuit <highlight><bold>495</bold></highlight> may include a receiving test structure <highlight><bold>497</bold></highlight>, connected to the transmitting test structure <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> by way of a conductive element <highlight><bold>485</bold></highlight>, which may be a signal trace to be characterized. Thus, the TDR can launch a signal <highlight><bold>488</bold></highlight> into the test structure <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, such that the signal <highlight><bold>488</bold></highlight> can then propagate down the trace <highlight><bold>485</bold></highlight>, and on into the receiving test structure <highlight><bold>497</bold></highlight>. A second microprobe (not shown) can then be placed onto the receiving test structure <highlight><bold>497</bold></highlight> so as to capture the signal <highlight><bold>488</bold></highlight> after propagation down the trace, and the resulting received signal <highlight><bold>488</bold></highlight> can be analyzed on the display <highlight><bold>486</bold></highlight>. The circuit board <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> may also be fabricated for use as a stand-alone test coupon, well known to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> It will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that the embodiments shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> illustrate a circuit board and testing system in which the novel signal launching circuitry of the present invention, having a mirrored pair of conductors formed in an open-funnel shape, having an inlet surrounded by a ground pad, and supported by a dielectric layer with a ground plane connected to the ground pad, is included. Thus, one of ordinary skill in the art will understand upon reading this description that the test structure circuitry of the present invention can be used in applications other than for circuit boards and testing systems, and thus, the invention is not to be so limited. The illustrations of a circuit board <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 2</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, as well as the testing system <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, are intended to provide a general understanding of some applications which may be served by the structure and circuitry of the present invention, and are not intended to serve as a complete description of all the elements and features of circuit boards or systems which make use of the novel test structure circuitry and structures described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Applications which may include the novel test structure circuitry of the present invention as described in this document include electronic circuitry used in high-speed computers, arrays of memory modules and other circuit cards, device drivers, power modules, communication circuitry, modems, processor modules, memory integrated circuits, embedded processors, and application-specific modules, including multilayer, multi-chip modules. Such circuitry may further be included as sub-components within a variety of electronic systems, such as televisions, cellular telephones, personal computers, aircraft, and others. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are similarly useful in presenting the application of various methods which may be carried out according to the teachings of the present invention. Those of ordinary skill in the art will realize that various elements of the circuit boards and systems of the present invention may be assembled and used in accordance with the structures described in the various figures. However, for clarity, at least one embodiment of a method conducted according to the teachings of the present invention will be specifically illustrated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> flow chart diagram of a method of forming a test structure according to the teachings of the present invention can be seen. The method of forming a test structure includes selecting a dielectric layer having a first surface and a conductive second surface in step <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>, and forming a conductive ground pad on the first surface in step <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>. As noted in step <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>, forming the conductive ground pad in step <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> may include forming the conductive ground pad so as to include a groove. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The method then continues with forming the first and second launching conductors in step <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>, such that each one of the launching conductors is formed on the first surface outside the region bearing the ground pad, such that the first and second launching conductors are formed generally parallel to and separated from each other by a first distance in the inlet portion, tapering toward each other in a transition portion, and parallel to and separated from each other by a second distance (which is less than the first distance) in the outlet portion. Step <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> may in turn include forming the first and second launching conductors such that the inlet portion (formed by the transmitting ends of the first and second launching conductors) is substantially disposed within the groove (formed in step <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>), as is shown in step <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight>. It should be noted that the groove is usually formed so as to substantially evenly surround the inlet portion of the open funnel formed by the first and second launching conductors, as discussed above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The method may then conclude with connecting the ground pad to the conductive second surface of the dielectric layer in step <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the method may conclude by connecting the ground pad to the conductive second surface using a plurality of vias extending through the dielectric layer, as shown in step <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Thus, the present invention provides novel test structure circuitry, apparatus, circuit boards, and testing systems. According to the teachings of the invention, methods are also disclosed to form such circuitry and circuit boards. The invention obviates the need for large edge-mounted SMA connectors to launch differential test signals on to circuit boards for characterizing board performance, as well as various components that may be mounted thereon, greatly simplifying the testing, measurement, and characterization process. The invention also greatly improves the accuracy of, and contributes uniformity to, TDR measurements, and other high frequency test and characterization measurements, since the ability to minimize impedance discontinuities while maintaining a desired differential impedance up to the measurement point with respect to differential testing signals is provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Although specific embodiments have been illustrated and described herein, it will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that any arrangement which is calculated to achieve the same purpose may be substituted for the specific embodiment shown. This application is intended to cover any and all adaptations or variations of the present invention. It is to be understood that the above description has been made in an illustrative fashion, and not a restrictive one. Combinations of the above embodiments, and other embodiments not specifically described herein will be apparent to those of skill in the art upon reviewing the above description. The scope of the invention includes any other applications in which the above structures, circuitry, and fabrication and assembly methods are used.
