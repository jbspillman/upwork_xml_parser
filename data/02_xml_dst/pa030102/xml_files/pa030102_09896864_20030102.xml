<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to endoluminal devices, such as stents, grafts, and/or prostheses and, more specifically, to the detection of endoleaks or changes in morphology after implantation of a prosthesis. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A stent is an elongated device used to support an intraluminal wall. In the case of a stenosis, a stent provides an unobstructed conduit for blood in the area of the stenosis. Such a stent may also have a prosthetic graft layer of fabric or covering lining the inside or outside thereof, such a covered stent being commonly referred to in the art as an intraluminal prosthesis, an endoluminal or endovascular graft (EVG), or a stent-graft. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A prosthesis may be used, for example, to treat a vascular aneurysm by removing the pressure on a weakened part of an artery so as to reduce the risk of rupture. Typically, a prosthesis is implanted in a blood vessel at the site of a stenosis or aneurysm endoluminally, i.e. by so-called &ldquo;minimally invasive techniques&rdquo; in which the prosthesis, restrained in a radially compressed configuration by a sheath or catheter, is delivered by a deployment system or &ldquo;introducer&rdquo; to the site where it is required. The introducer may enter the body through the patient&apos;s skin, or by a &ldquo;cut down&rdquo; technique in which the entry blood vessel is exposed by minor surgical means. When the introducer has been threaded into the body lumen to the prosthesis deployment location, the introducer is manipulated to cause the prosthesis to be ejected from the surrounding sheath or catheter in which it is restrained (or alternatively the surrounding sheath or catheter is retracted from the prosthesis), whereupon the prosthesis expands to a predetermined diameter at the deployment location, and the introducer is withdrawn. Stent expansion may be effected by spring elasticity, balloon expansion, or by the self-expansion of a thermally or stress-induced return of a memory material to a pre-conditioned expanded configuration. Various types of stent architectures are known in the art, including many designs comprising a filament or number of filaments, such as a wire or wires, wound or braided into a particular configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> One common application for the implantation of prostheses is for treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). AAA stents are typically placed into the aorta and iliac bifurcation with a covering to isolate the aneurysm from the blood. After the aneurysm has been isolated for some time, endoleaks may occur due to worn fabric or other reasons. Because the isolated aneurysm has become weak as a result of being isolated, once the leak starts, blood flow and pressure is slowly restored to the aneurysm, and the aneurysm may rupture. Currently, leaks are detected during follow-up angiograms and MRIs, but if the follow up visit does not coincide with the duration of time within which the leak must be treated, the undetected endoleak may result in a ruptured aneurysm that is fatal to the patient. Another method of detecting an endoleak is checking the aortic pressure with respect to the aneurysm sac pressure. This can be accomplished by introducing a pressure-sensing needle into the aneurysm sac through the skin while checking the aortic pressure using an invasive procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In addition to endoleaks, other problems may also ensue after implantation of a prosthesis that can cause problems if undetected. For example, after the aneurysm is isolated, the morphology of the prosthesis may change as the aneurysm shrinks. The changing morphology may lead to iliac occlusions that occur with little to no forewarning. Current non-invasive monitoring techniques are not always successful in detecting such changing morphology. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Thus, there is a need in the art to provide non-invasive means of detecting endoleaks and/or the changing morphology of implanted prostheses. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The invention comprises an endoluminal device comprising a prosthesis having at least one indicator member affixed to the prosthesis, such as woven into or attached to the stent or graft or sandwiched therebetween, that is adapted to be remotely monitored to indicate a change in pressure or morphology of the prosthesis. The indicator member may comprise an optical fiber, a strain gauge, or a first material having a first magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) susceptibility value that contrasts with a second MRI susceptibility value of a second material that comprises one or more remaining members of the prosthesis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The invention also comprises a prosthesis monitoring system, and a subassembly therefor, comprising a prosthesis for implantation in a lumen, the prosthesis comprising at least a first optical fiber member having a first end affixed to the prosthesis and a second end. The system further comprises means for sending an input optical signal through the optical fiber and receiving an output optical signal, such means attached to the first optical fiber second end. A transmitter may be used to transfer the information related to the return signal to a remote receiver. Where the prosthesis is deployed to isolate an aneurysm having an aneurysm sac, the system may further comprise a second optical fiber having a first end deployed in the aneurysm sac and a second end connected to the means sending signals. The means for sending/receiving signals and the transmitter may be subcutaneously implanted, thus forming an implantable subassembly. The subassembly may further comprise a subcutaneously implantable battery for supplying power to the system and a remotely-activatable, subcutaneously implantable switch for turning power on and off to the system from the battery. The subassembly may cooperate with external electronics for displaying the data externally. The first optical fiber may be configured to measure bending of the optical fiber, or the first, and optionally the second, optical fiber may be configured to measure pressure at the first end of the optical fiber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The invention further comprises a prosthesis monitoring system at least partially implantable within a body for detecting a change in morphology of an implanted prosthesis. The morphology change detection system comprises an indicator affixed to the prosthesis and adapted to indicate the change in morphology in a remotely measurable manner, and remote monitoring means for detecting the indication of the change in morphology indicated by the indicator. In one embodiment, the indicator may comprise at least one member integral to the prosthesis that has a first magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) susceptibility value that contrasts with a second MRI susceptibility value of a second material that comprises one or more remaining members of the prosthesis, the member having a configuration adapted to change in response to the change in morphology. In this embodiment, the remote monitoring means comprises a MRI device adapted to detect the configuration of the member. In other embodiments, the system comprises an implantable optical fiber for conveying information from the indicator to the remote monitoring means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The invention also comprises a prosthesis monitoring system at least partially implantable within a body for detecting an endoleak in an implanted prosthesis. The endoleak detection system comprises an implantable indicator adapted to indicate a change in pressure attributable to an endoleak and remote monitoring means for detecting the indication of the change in pressure provided by the indicator. The indicator may be affixed to the prosthesis, such as a strain gauge or the indicator may be adapted to be deployed in or on the aneurysm sac. In one embodiment, the indicator comprises a first optical fiber member adapted to be mounted in the aneurysm sac to detect pressure and the system further comprises means for sending at least a first input optical signal and receiving at least a first output optical signal through at least the first optical fiber. In one embodiment, the indicator consists only of the pressure-detecting optical fiber member in the aneurysm sac, but in another embodiment, the indicator comprises at least a second pressure-detecting optical fiber member affixed to the prosthesis. In this embodiment, the signal means is further adapted to send a second input optical signal and receive a second output optical signal through the second optical fiber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The invention also comprises methods for using the systems described herein. A method for detecting a change in morphology of a prosthesis implanted within a body comprises implanting the prosthesis in a lumen of the body, the prosthesis comprising an indicator affixed thereto and adapted to indicate the change in morphology of the prosthesis. The change in morphology indicated by the indicator is detected by remote monitoring means outside the body. Where the indicator comprises a first MRI-susceptible material that contrasts with a second MRI-susceptible material that comprises one or more remaining members of the prosthesis, the monitoring step comprises first using an MRI device to perform a first MRI procedure and record a result thereof as a baseline morphology. Then, the MRI device is used to perform a subsequent MRI procedure, and a result of the subsequent MRI procedure is compared to the baseline morphology to determine if there has been any change in morphology. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> A method for detecting an endoleak in an implanted prosthesis comprises the steps of implanting the prosthesis in a body lumen and implanting a monitoring system comprising an indicator for detecting a change in aneurysm sac pressure, the indicator in communication with means for conveying information from the indicator to a remote monitor outside the body. The method further comprises activating the monitoring system to cause the indicator to communicate with the means for conveying and to cause the means for conveying to transmit information to the remote monitoring means. The method may comprise implanting the prosthesis to isolate an aneurysm that comprises an aneurysm sac, and deploying a first optical fiber in the aneurysm sac. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Where the indicator consists only of the first optical fiber, the method may further comprise periodically monitoring pressure measured using the first optical fiber over a period of time sufficient to establish a baseline profile and then monitoring changes from the baseline profile, interpreting a change from the baseline profile greater than a threshold value as an indication of an endoleak. Where the prosthesis further comprises a second optical fiber integral to the stent and coupled to the monitoring system, the method may further comprise periodically monitoring a differential pressure between the first optical fiber and the second optical fiber and interpreting a change in the differential pressure greater than a threshold pressure as an indication of an endoleak.</paragraph>

Device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is part of an internal monitoring system, which is implanted to monitor prosthesis <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and aneurysm <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Proximal end <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of fiber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is disposed outside of lumen <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and is attached to subcutaneous electronics package <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, which is attached below skin <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of the patient. The mounting location for subcutaneous electronics may be the abdomen, chest, or any location where the electronics may be comfortably and safely mounted on or within a patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> schematically illustrates exemplary electronic components of an exemplary prosthesis monitoring system <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, including an exemplary subcutaneous electronics package <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. Subcutaneous electronics package <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> comprises a light source <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for sending a signal down optical fiber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a spectrometer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to receive the return signal from optic sensor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Coupler <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> allows the same fiber to be used for both sending and receiving optical signals. Light source <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may comprise any light source suitable for use with an optical fiber as is known in the art, such as a light emitting diode (LED) or a laser source. Although the optical signal generated by such light sources is typically a signal visible to the human eye, a light signal of any wavelength may be used. Although light source <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, coupler <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, and spectrometer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are shown in the embodiment in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, any suitable means or components for sending and receiving a signal through an optical fiber may be used. Optical fiber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is connected to subcutaneous electronics package <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> by two-part connector <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, one part <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the connector mounted to the electronics package and the mating part <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>mounted to fiber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The internal monitoring system further comprises a telemetric transmitter <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in communication with spectrometer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> for transferring information to a remote receiver <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Transmitter <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> may transmit any type of signal capable of traveling through human skin, such as an electromagnetic signal or an optical signal. Light source <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, spectrometer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and output transmitter <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are powered by a battery <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. To conserve energy, implanted battery <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can be turned on and off via remotely-activatable switch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, such as a magnetic switch, also known as a Hall-effect sensor. A switch operated by electromagnetic waves transmissible through the skin, or any other type of remotely-activatable switch may also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Prosthesis monitoring system <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> further comprises external electronics <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, including remote receiver unit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and data processor <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, which may be separate units connected by cable <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and connectors <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, or a single unit (not shown). Remote receiver unit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> comprises a bar magnet <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> which is used in conjunction with round magnets <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in subcutaneous electronics <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> to align remote receiver <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> over transmitter <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and to activate magnetic switch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Data processor <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> comprises an analog-to-digital (a/d) converter <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> for converting analog information received by receiver <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> into digital information that may be stored in central processing unit (CPU)/memory unit <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. Data processor <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> further comprises a display driver <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> and a corresponding display <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, as well as a battery <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> for powering the data processor. The internal components of data processor <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> may comprise more or fewer components than shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, however, and may include any number of components necessary to convert the signal received by receiver <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to a usable form for monitoring the prosthesis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The information transferred by output transmitter <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> may be raw information relating to the signal received by spectrometer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, or subcutaneous electronics <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> may include an a/d converter and/or a CPU/memory unit to enable the subcutaneous system to analyze data continuously or on some periodic basis, and log that data and/or analysis. Implantable devices for monitoring physiological events are known generally in the art, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,987,352 to Klein et al., incorporated herein by reference. Where data analysis is continuously performed, it may not be desirable for subcutaneous electronics to have a switch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, but instead to have a battery charger to allow recharging of battery <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> from outside the body inductively or through the use of electromagnetic energy. A recharging port may also protrude through the patient&apos;s skin to allow a direct connection. Switchless operation and battery recharging capability may be provided for systems even without continuous data monitoring capability, if desired. Furthermore, in yet another embodiment, the power to run the light source, spectrometer, and output transmitter may be transmitted from an external source by any of the same processes by which a battery may be recharged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment, there may be no subcutaneously-mounted power supply, but instead a subcutaneous connection port <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> (shown with dashed lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) may be accessible from outside the body, such as through or othera percutaneous access device may be. In particular, a percutaneous access device such as is described in a U.S. patent application entitled &ldquo;Percutaneous Access,&rdquo; to Brett Haarala and Paul DiCarlo (attorney docket no. BSC-179), assigned to the assignee of this application, filed on the same date as this application, and incorporated herein by reference, may be provided. Connection port <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> may be protrude through the cover of the percutaneous access device, or be accessible by opening the cover of the device. Other subcutaneous data ports known in the art, for example, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,205,286 to Soukup et al., incorporated herein by reference, may also be used. In an embodiment that includes a subcutaneous connection port or percutaneous access device, remote monitoring device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may connect directly to the subcutaneous electronics package via the connection port, sending power to light source <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, which sends an input optical signal through optical fiber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, which returns an output optical signal that is read by spectrometer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, which provides a signal that is received directly by the remote monitoring device through the connection port. In this way, information from the subcutaneous electronics is communicated to the remote monitoring device. Thus, part or all of the electronics of the present invention may be contained in the cavity defined by the housing of the percutaneous access device described in the Haarala and DiCarlo application. The electronics may be fully contained in the percutaneous access device, with a transmitter <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> for transmitting a data signal, or may only be partially contained, with a physical connection for transmitting data or power protruding through the cover of the device or accessible by opening the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In yet another embodiment, only connector <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and a portion of optical fiber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>(or connector <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>alone) may protrude from the body or be housed in or accessible through the cover of a percutaneous access device. In such an embodiment, an external light source similar to light source <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may be used to emit a signal to an optic sensor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>via the optical fiber itself, and with the spectrometer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> serving to receive the signal back from the optic sensor. Such a system avoids the need for a transmitter and a receiver, as the information may be directly transferred through optical fiber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> For detection of endoleaks, optical sensor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>at distal end <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of optical fiber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, may comprise a pressure transducer. Optical-fiber-based pressure transducers are known in the art, for example, as manufactured by RJC Enterprises of Woodinville, Wash.; as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,052,613 to Takaki and assigned to Terumo Cardiovascular Systems Corporation of Somerset, N.J.; or as described in &ldquo;Fiber-optic Transducer Aids Heart Monitoring,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Engineering News, </italic></highlight>Jun. 7, 1999, both of which are incorporated herein by reference. A model FOP-M in-vivo pressure sensor, manufactured by FISO Technologies, of Quebec, Canada, may also be particularly useful for the application of this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In the exemplary embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, optical fiber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is implanted with its distal end <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>mounted in aneurysm sac <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of aneurysm <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and proximal end <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>connected to subcutaneous electronics package <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. Optical fiber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in aneurysm sac <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may be implanted laproscopically. Fiber optic sensor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>measures the pressure in aneurysm sac <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and this information is gathered and processed in similar fashion to the information collected by sensor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Although not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, fiber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>may have an independent signal emitter/receiver device or assembly similar to light source <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, coupler <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, and spectrometer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, or electronics <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> may comprise a single light source with multiple channels and a single spectrometer with multiple channels to serve multiple fibers, each fiber having an associated coupler. Accordingly, the subcutaneous electronics may have a separate transmitter for each fiber, or a single transmitter that transmits multiple channels of information simultaneously. In embodiments including data processing elements such as the a/d converter <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and CPU/memory <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> within subcutaneous electronics <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, a single channel of information may be transmitted, with bursts of information corresponding to the reading from each fiber transmitted sequentially, or composite information taken from both fibers, such as differential pressure information, may be transmitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> having both optical fiber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>integral to prosthesis <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and an optical fiber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>integral to aneurysm sac <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the method of detecting endoleaks comprises monitoring the differential pressure between optic sensor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>mounted at the end of optical fiber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and optic sensor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>mounted at the end of optical fiber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>A differential pressure greater than a threshold pressure or a baseline differential pressure may be interpreted as an indication of an endoleak. Such a baseline or differential pressure may be determined by identifying the value of the pressure differential in a body where it is known that no leaking is occurring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, a monitoring system may consist of only fiber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>(with the associated electronics as described above) for measuring only the pressure within aneurysm sac <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, an initial pressure in the aneurysm sac may be measured soon after placement of the prosthesis and recorded as a baseline pressure when no leaking is occurring. Then, the prosthesis monitoring system is used to take subsequent pressure readings, and the readings are compared to the baseline pressure to determine if there has been any change in pressure. A change from the baseline profile greater than a threshold value may be interpreted as an indication of an endoleak. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In yet another alternative embodiment, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, optical fiber <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may be implanted laproscopically so that it wraps around the outer surface of aneurysm <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Spectrometer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may be configured to detect changes in the optical signal caused by bending of the optical fiber. The use of optical fibers to detect bending of the fiber is known in the art, for example as described in &ldquo;Fiber Optic Sensors and Their Applications,&rdquo; by A. Selvarajan, incorporated herein by reference. Optical fiber <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> may then be monitored to determine if it changes its shape or if pulsatile motion (pulsing motion associated with the beating of the heart) is detected, either of which may indicate an endoleak. Additionally, or in the alternative, one or more optical fibers <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>may be laproscopically implanted longitudinally on the outer surface of aneurysm <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to detect a change in morphology of the aneurysm or pulsatile motion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Thus, a method of detecting an endoleak may comprise implanting a prosthesis <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, at least one optical fiber, such as <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>(or <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), and optionally subcutaneous electronics <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. Switch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may be activated to allow power to flow from battery <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to activate light source <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to send an input optical signal to fiber optic sensor(s) <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and/or <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, each of which returns an output optical signal that is read by spectrometer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Spectrometer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> then communicates with output transmitter <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, and the transmitter transmits information to remote receiver <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Remote receiver <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> transmits the information to data processor <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> which processes the information. The processed information is then used to determine the pressure or differential pressure, including establishing a baseline pressure or baseline differential pressure and deviance therefrom to indicate an endoleak. In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the processed information is used to determine an aneurysm sac morphology baseline and deviance therefrom or to detect pulsatile motion to indicate an endoleak. </paragraph>

Optical fibers <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>may be configured to measure bending of the optical fiber, which may be particularly useful for measuring changing morphology of prosthesis <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. Prosthesis <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> comprises an aortic trunk portion <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> and two iliac leg portions <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The optical fiber may be woven into aortic trunk portion <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>, such as helical fiber <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, or in iliac leg portion such as circumferential fiber <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. A fiber wound helically, circumferentially, or in any portion of a circumference or helix may also be referred to as a &ldquo;radial fiber.&rdquo; Fiber <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>that runs along the length of prosthesis <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> may be referred to as a &ldquo;longitudinal&rdquo; fiber. Fibers <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>may be attached in any number of ways, such as by weaving the fibers within the graft or stent of the prosthesis, sandwiching the fibers between the graft and stent, or bonding the fibers to the graft or stent with an adhesive. Methods of attaching the fibers are discussed in more detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> For a prosthesis comprising a graft referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, optical fiber <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> may be woven into the graft, with element <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> representing a strand of the graft. Similarly, element <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> may represent a stent filament or strand into which optical fiber <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> is woven. Although shown as a braided architecture in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the stent or graft may comprise any architecture known in the art. For a prosthesis <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> comprising both a graft <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> having an outer surface <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> and an inner surface <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> relative to lumen wall <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight>, and a stent <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> also having an outer surface <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight> and an inner surface <highlight><bold>632</bold></highlight>, the graft may be mounted on the stent inner or outer surface, and the optical fiber may be mounted on the inner or outer surface of the graft or the stent. Accordingly, although shown in an embodiment with optical fiber <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight> sandwiched between graft <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> and stent <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the relationships among the graft, stent, and optical fiber may be any of the possible combinations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Thus, one exemplary method for detecting a change in morphology of a prosthesis implanted within a body may comprise implanting a prosthesis, such as prosthesis <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, having an integral optical fiber, such as any of fibers <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>, or <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4, 5</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, respectively, in a lumen, and implanting subcutaneous electronics, such as electronics <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, in communication with the integral optical fiber. The information provided by endoluminal device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is processed by data processor <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to establish a prosthesis morphology baseline and deviance therefrom. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In yet another embodiment, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>A, prosthesis <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> may have an indicator that comprises at least one strain gauge <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, or as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, at least one strain gauge <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>may be placed on aneurysm sac <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Strain gauges <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>each have a power lead <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> to deliver power to the strain gauge and a signal lead <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> to transmit the strain reading to the electronics. Any type of micro-measurement strain gauge or strain gauge assembly suitable for implantation in the human body may be used. An exemplary strain gauge assembly <highlight><bold>719</bold></highlight> having a &ldquo;rosette&rdquo; design, manufactured by Micro-Flexitronics Limited, of Coleraine, Northern Ireland, is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference>. Strain gauge assembly <highlight><bold>719</bold></highlight> comprises a mounting pad <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight> on which three individual strain gauges <highlight><bold>722</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>723</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>724</bold></highlight> are mounted. Each individual strain gauge comprises a strain gauge array <highlight><bold>726</bold></highlight> and a pair of solder pads <highlight><bold>728</bold></highlight> to which leads (<highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference>) may be attached. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Similar to the optical fiber embodiments described above, the monitoring system for a strain gauge embodiment preferably includes subcutaneous electronics, similar to electronics <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, and external electronics <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, including remote receiver unit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and data processor <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. For a strain gauge embodiment, however, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, subcutaneous electronics <highlight><bold>835</bold></highlight> do not include a light source, spectrometer, or coupler, but rather merely include connectors <highlight><bold>823</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>823</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and associated wiring for connecting power lead <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> to battery <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> via switch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and connectors <highlight><bold>824</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>824</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and associated wiring for connecting signal lead <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> to output transmitter <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> As with the optical fiber embodiments, configurations including subcutaneous data processing electronics, including configurations having continuous operation without a switch but with a battery recharging mechanism; configurations without a subcutaneous battery; configurations without any subcutaneous electronics; or any of the various configurations discussed above or analogous configurations may be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment without subcutaneous electronics, one or more integral strain gauges may be implanted, and a connection port, which is connected to power lead <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> and a signal lead <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight>, may protrude from the lumen and/or from the skin. The connection port may be housed in or on the cover of a percutaneous access device, as described above. To take a reading, a remote monitoring device including data processing electronics <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is then attached to the connection port, and the monitoring device sends power down power lead <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>, enabling the strain gauge to take a reading, and the reading is received through signal lead <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Consistent with the general description of the invention, in this embodiment, the indicator device is strain gauge <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>or <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the signal lead <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> serves to convey the signal from the strain gauge to remote monitoring device (data processor <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>) that is periodically connected to the signal lead to take the strain gauge reading. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Strain gauges may be used for morphology change detection by attaching the strain gauges to or weaving them into the graft in any location along the prosthesis as may be desired, such as in the trunk section, iliac section, or in multiple locations, just as with the optical fibers as described above and shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, strain gauge <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> and leads <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> (not shown) may be sandwiched between graft <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> and stent <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary method for detecting a change in morphology of a prosthesis implanted within a body, the method first comprises implanting in a lumen a prosthesis having at least one integral strain gauge <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> and implanting subcutaneous electronics <highlight><bold>835</bold></highlight>. The method then comprises remotely activating switch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to allow power to flow from power supply <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to activate strain gauge <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>, which sends a signal to transmitter <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, which transmits information to remote monitoring means <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which sends the information to data processor <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The information is used to determine a baseline morphology of the prosthesis and deviation therefrom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Endoleak Detection </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> For detection of endoleaks, one or more strain gauges <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> may be mounted laproscopically on the aneurysm sac <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. Strain gauges <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> may then be monitored to determine if there is a change in the morphology of aneurysm sac <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> or to detect pulsatile motion of the aneurysm sac, either of which may indicate an endoleak. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> MRI-Susceptible Fiber Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment similar to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, member <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> within graft or stent <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> may be, instead of an optical fiber, a member that has a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) susceptibility value that contrasts with the MRI susceptibility value of the remaining stent or graft material. As shown in one embodiment represented by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, member <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> is a non-redundant filament within graft <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>, but may instead be a redundant &ldquo;tracer&rdquo; that runs alongside an structurally integral filament of the graft or stent. The term &ldquo;magnetic susceptibility&rdquo; is a dimensionless ratio well-known in the field of MRI, and is comprehensively discussed by Schenck, John F., &ldquo;The Role of Magnetic Susceptibility in Magnetic Resonance Imaging: MRI Magnetic Compatibility of the First and Second Kinds,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Med. Phys. </italic></highlight>23 (6), June 1996, pp. 815-850, and incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> For example, if element <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> is a stent comprising a material having a positive susceptibility value, such as molybdenum having a susceptibility value of 123&times;10<highlight><superscript>6</superscript></highlight>, indicator member <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> preferably comprises a material having a negative susceptibility value, such as gold having a susceptibility value of &minus;34&times;10<highlight><superscript>6</superscript></highlight>. Conversely, if stent <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> comprises a material having a negative susceptibility value, such as zinc having a susceptibility value of &minus;15.7&times;10<highlight><superscript>6</superscript></highlight>,indicator member <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> preferably comprises a material having a positive susceptibility value, such as titanium having a susceptibility value of 182&times;10<highlight><superscript>6</superscript></highlight>. Thus, as the orientation of indicator member <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> changes in response to changes in morphology of stent <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>, the change in configuration may be readily detected by MRI techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> An MRI device may be used for performing a first imaging procedure, from which the results are recorded as a baseline morphology. Then, the MRI device may be used to perform subsequent imaging procedures, where the results of the subsequent procedures are compared to the baseline morphology to determine if there has been any change in morphology. </paragraph>
