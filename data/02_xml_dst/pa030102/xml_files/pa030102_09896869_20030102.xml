<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">An improved air-cooling system for high performance, high density electronic equipment comprises, in one embodiment, a single fan having a radial impeller, a baffle having an inlet portion to efficiently direct air into the fan intake, and a two-tiered outlet plenum to direct one airflow specifically at the highest heat-generating components and another airflow at all components. The air-cooling system is designed to provide maximum cooling for a low-height, high heat-generating electronics module such as a server. By using only a single fan that is matched to the low resistance airflow characteristics of the baffle, the air-cooling system offers significant advantages over multi-fan systems. Also described are a computer server and methods of making heat-dissipation equipment. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to heat dissipation in electronic apparatus. More particularly, the present invention relates to an improved air-cooling system for high density electronic equipment. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Computer networks, such as the Internet, utilize high performance computer systems called &ldquo;servers&rdquo;. Servers typically have high performance processors and contain hardware and software capable of handling large amounts of data. Servers provide a large number of computer users with access to large stores of information. For example, servers are used to host web sites that can be accessed by many computers via the Internet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> One or more server components are often housed within a server housing or &ldquo;server rack&rdquo;. Server racks are typically box-like structures or cabinets that contain a number of removable electronic modules or electronic trays (&ldquo;e-trays&rdquo;). Each e-tray can be a different server, or each e-tray can hold one or more components of a server. Server components can include electronic modules, for example, for processors, disk drives (such as floppy disk drives, hard drives, compact disk (CD) drives, and digital video disk (DVD) drives), random access memory (RAM), network interfaces and controllers, SCSI (small computer systems interface) bus controllers, video controllers, parallel and serial ports, power supplies, and so forth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> There is an ever increasing demand by computer users for higher performance levels in computer equipment, such as servers. Because such equipment operates at higher and higher power levels, there is, as a direct consequence, an ever accelerating requirement to dissipate the thermal energy or heat produced by the equipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> For example, a server having dual high-performance processors, such as processors from the Intel&reg; 64-bit Itanium&trade; family of processors (available from Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, Calif., U.S.A.), can produce a significant amount of heat, which can be in the order of several hundred watts of heat. To compound the problem, when a server at this performance level is packaged in an industry-standard &ldquo;1U&rdquo; height server (i.e. only 1.75 inches (4.445 cm) in height), heat dissipation can become a significant concern. If the heat is not adequately dissipated, the server equipment could be damaged, or the processors could be automatically throttled down to operate at a slower speed than their nominal rating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Many air-cooled systems have been used to cool electronics equipment, including computer equipment, in the past. In the past, relatively high performance electronic equipment generally required larger, more complex, and more powerful cooling solutions, as well as a corresponding increase in the size of the equipment cabinet or other type of equipment housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> For example, high performance computer equipment required an increase in the cabinet height to accommodate axial fans having larger propellers, as well as a greater number of axial fans per chassis. It is not unusual to see a half-dozen or more axial-type fans deployed on a single high performance chassis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> These fans, and their associated airflow ducting, can consume an enormous amount of real estate on the chassis. They also contribute substantially to the cost, complexity, size, and height of the computer system, not to mention the additional noise that they produce due to the fact they typically run at high RPM, e.g. exceeding 10,000 RPM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Floor space for server racks is expensive, and it is desirable to pack as much computer performance into as small a space as possible. However, for the reasons set forth above, this can create significant heat dissipation problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> For the reasons stated above, and for other reasons stated below which will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon reading and understanding the present specification, there is a significant need in the art for improved air-cooling systems for high performance electronic equipment that do not suffer the disadvantages of the prior art air-cooling systems, and for associated methods of making heat dissipation apparatus for high performance, high density electronic equipment.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In the following detailed description of embodiments of the invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific preferred embodiments in which the inventions may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention, and it is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and that mechanical, compositional, structural, electrical, and procedural changes may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a solution to the need to efficiently and quietly dissipate heat that is generated by high performance electronic equipment, and to do so in a manner that is relatively simple and inexpensive, and that does not increase chassis height or consume an undue amount of chassis real estate. Various embodiments are illustrated and described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a perspective view of an air-cooled electronics tray <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. Electronics tray (&ldquo;e-tray&rdquo;) <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> comprises a chassis that includes side panels <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, front panel <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, rear panel <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, top panel <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>), and bottom panel <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). In one embodiment, e-tray is approximately 1.75&Prime; (4.445 cm) high, 17&Prime; (43 cm) wide, and 24&Prime; (61 cm) deep. A 1U-type chassis is a standard 1.75&Prime; (4.445 cm) in height. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> E-tray <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> includes electronic apparatus in the form of electronic components, such as hard drive <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, memory boards <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, printed circuit board (PCB) <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and mezzanine board <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. PCB <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and mezzanine board <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can include any number of electronic devices, including integrated circuits (IC&apos;s) and discrete devices. The IC&apos;s can include memory chips, chipsets, and one or more processor chips. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, e-tray <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> comprises a pair of high performance 64-bit processors from the Intel&reg; Itanium&trade; family of processors. These processors typically can operate at 1 Gigahertz clock speeds or higher. However, any type of high performance processor(s) could be used on e-tray <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Further, more than two or fewer than two processors could be used. As used herein, &ldquo;processor&rdquo; means any type of computational circuit, such as but not limited to a microprocessor, a microcontroller, a complex instruction set computing (CISC) microprocessor, a reduced instruction set computing (RISC) microprocessor, a very long instruction word (VLIW) microprocessor, a graphics processor, a digital signal processor, a communications processor, an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), or any other type of processor or processing circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> At least one set of heat sink fins <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or other type of thermal interface arrangement, such as a heat pipe or heat spreader, is provided to conduct heat from devices that produce high levels of heat. Fins <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> conduct heat directly from the heat-generating devices to ambient air surrounding the devices. However, unless the chassis includes a mechanism for ridding itself of this increase in ambient heat, heat will build up to an undesirable level within the chassis, impacting the performance and life of electronic components on the chassis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Thus e-tray <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> comprises heat-dissipation apparatus. In one embodiment, the heat-dissipation apparatus comprises a fan indicated generally by reference number <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and an arrangement of baffles. Fan <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> includes a motor housing <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) and a radial impeller <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Radial impeller <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> can be of the &ldquo;squirrel cage&rdquo; variety, and its individual vanes or blades can be either forward-curved or reverse-curved relative to the direction of spin. Radial impeller <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is coupled to an inner wall <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> that, in turn, is coupled to fan motor shaft <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, fan <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is a high-output radial impeller fan producing approximately 70 cubic feet (6.5 cubic meters) per minute. Radial fans generally run at much lower RPM (e.g. only 2800 RPM) than axial fans (typically greater than 10,000 RPM). This also significantly increases the lifespan of a radial fan over an axial fan running at much higher RPM. However, the invention is not to be construed as limited to the use of a radial impeller fan, and any other type of fan that can generate comparable airflow within the geometrical constraints of the chassis can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Fan <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> draws in outside air through a grill <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> in front panel <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Grill <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> can serve as an electromagnetic interference (EMI) grid. Alternatively, a separate EMI grid (not shown) can be employed in conjunction with grill <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> A baffle, indicated generally by reference number <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, directs air into fan <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and from there out to the electronic components on PCB <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and on mezzanine <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> that require cooling. As seen better in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, baffle <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> comprises an inlet portion, generally indicated by reference number <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and an outlet portion, generally indicated by reference number <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Although baffle <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is described as comprising an inlet portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and an outlet portion, baffle <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can be implemented in any appropriate number of physical elements, including separate inlet and outlet baffles, a single integrated baffle structure having inlet and outlet portions, and so forth. Baffle <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can be made of any suitable material, such as molded plastic, fiberglass, or metal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Referring once again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, fan <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> pumps air into outlet portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, indicated generally by reference number <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Outlet portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> comprises two exit plenums <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Exit plenums <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are formed, in one embodiment, such that their cross-sectional areas increase with increasing distance from fan <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, in a shape that is somewhat analogous to a nautilus shell. This shape minimizes back pressure and turbulence within exit plenums <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, enabling them to conduct air more efficiently. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> first portion of the air being pumped by fan <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> goes into exit plenum <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and a second portion of the air goes into exit plenum <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. This is seen more clearly in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> to be discussed below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Continuing with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the portion of the air going through exit plenum <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> emanates from its air outlet in the direction indicated by arrows <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and flows through heat sink fins <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the processor packages (<highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>), carrying away heated ambient air and exiting the chassis through holes in rear panel <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in the direction indicated by arrows <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The air leaving exit plenum <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is thus directed at chassis components that are generating a relatively large amount of heat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Similarly, the portion of the air going through exit plenum <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> emanates from its air outlet in the direction indicated by arrows <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and flows over memory boards <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and over other heat-generating components on mezzanine <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and on PCB <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, carrying away heated ambient air and exiting the chassis through holes in rear panel <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in the direction indicated by arrows <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Baffle <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and fan <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are individually available from Torrington Research Company, Torrington, Conn., U.S.A., whose URL is WWW.TRCT.com. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a top view of the air-cooled electronics tray <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. As mentioned earlier, baffle <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> comprises an inlet portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and an outlet portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. If one follows a geometrical line (such as dashed line <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>) from grill <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> inward to PCB <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and mezzanine <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, it is seen that inlet portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and outlet portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> overlap to a certain extent, due to the particular geometry of inlet portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and outlet portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. However, in other embodiments of a baffle, there may be no overlap, depending upon the particular geometry of the baffle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The shape of exit plenums <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of outlet portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Exit plenum <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> directs air through its end section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> at heat sink fins <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the processors (not shown, but positioned beneath heat sink fins <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>). Thus exit plenum <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> directs approximately half of the output of fan <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> at chassis components that are generating a significant amount of heat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Exit plenum <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> directs air through an end section having a width that is equivalent to the width of the chassis minus the width of the end section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> of exit plenum <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Exit plenum <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> directs approximately half of the output of fan <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> at chassis components that are positioned between exit plenum <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and rear panel <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>.

Baffle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> comprises substantially vertical sides <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, and it further comprises a raised platform <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>. A back wall <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> extends along the back of platform <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>. Side <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, side <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, back wall <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, platform <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>, and the top panel <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) form an intake plenum that bounds the air that is drawn in by fan <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Airflow <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is prevented from being recirculated back to fan <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by this structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Platform <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> comprises a large opening <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> juxtaposed to the intake of fan <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Opening <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> has a rounded lip <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> in one embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The approach area <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> to baffle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> comprises an angled ramp <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. Ramp <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> can have a step <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> around its outer periphery. Ramp <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> is formed in an arc about one side of opening <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. Ramp <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> decreases the cross-sectional area of the intake plenum in relation to the distance from the opening <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In operation, air is drawn into the approach area <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of baffle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, and it flows in the direction of arrows <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> over step <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, up ramp <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> onto platform <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>, through opening <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, and into the intake of fan <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the periphery of grill <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> in front panel <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) bounds a relatively small cross-sectional area through which all of the intake air must pass. To minimize the amount of work that fan <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> must perform, it is desirable to minimize the length of the region of narrowing cross-section that runs from grill <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to platform <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>. By providing an angled ramp <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, the region of narrowing cross-section is kept to a minimum, and intake air is efficiently funneled into the intake of fan <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Employing a relatively short region of small cross-section improves air intake performance over a non-ramped inlet to the baffle, in part because it offers less overall resistance to incoming airflow, and in part because back-pressure, vortices, eddys, and other undesirable airflow disturbances are minimized through the use of a short angled ramp <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, as opposed to a long, non-angled intake region or a rectangular intake region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In addition, an angled ramp <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> also enables EMI containment in the form of a grill or mesh to be positioned in the area of greatest cross-sectional area, not in a region of small cross-sectional area. Sufficient EMI containment can thus be provided while concurrently minimizing its effect on air flowing into the intake of fan <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Baffle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> can be made of any suitable material, such as molded plastic, fiberglass, or metal. </paragraph>

The profile of angled ramp <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> can clearly be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, as can the lip <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> around opening <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>) of platform <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> of baffle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Radial impeller <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> comprises a plurality of blades or vanes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> that are coupled to base member <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of radial impeller <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is a flow diagram illustrating a method of making heat dissipation apparatus for cooling an electronic assembly or other type of electronic chassis, in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. The method begins at <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, a chassis having a plurality of heat-generating components (e.g. IC&apos;s and/or discrete devices such as resistors, capacitors, and inductors) is provided. In one embodiment, a computer server is provided. In another embodiment, a 1U e-tray is provided that can be any type of electronic equipment, including a computer component. The chassis can be relatively low in height; e.g. in one embodiment the width-to-height ratio of the chassis is approximately 9 or greater. However, the present invention also performs well for width-to-height ratios that are less than 9, i.e. for chassis that are relatively high such as, without limitation, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>U or <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>U chassis. The geometry of the fan and of the inlet and outlet portions of the baffle can be appropriately adjusted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> While the embodiment shown in the figures is a server that is positioned in a horizontal rack, the present invention can also be used in vertical-type racks. For example, the exit plenums of the outlet portion of the baffle could be arranged side-by-side vertically rather than double-tiered horizontally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, a fan is mounted on the chassis. The fan can be of any type, such as a radial impeller fan, an axial impeller fan, or any other suitable type. In one embodiment, a single radial impeller fan is used to quietly, efficiently, cost-effectively, and reliably cool an entire server chassis or e-tray of the 1U form factor. However, in other embodiments more than one fan can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, a baffle is mounted on the chassis. In one embodiment, the baffle is constructed as one unit encompassing both an inlet baffle and an outlet baffle. In such an embodiment, the baffle has an inlet coupled to the fan and an outlet that is directed at the electronic components of the chassis. In another embodiment, as discussed earlier, separate inlet and outlet baffles can be utilized, and in such an embodiment the inlet baffle is coupled to the fan and directs air into the fan intake, and the outlet baffle directs air at the electronic components of the chassis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Still referring to <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, the outlet can include a first portion that is directed to electronic components that are generating a relatively large amount of heat, and a second portion that is directed at an area of the chassis that does not necessarily include such high heat generating components. Various alternatives are possible. For example, in one embodiment, the second portion can direct air towards electronic components over the entire chassis, or it could direct air only towards all electronic components except for those covered by the first portion, or it could direct air at a subset of the remaining electronic components, leaving a portion of the electronic components (e.g. low heat generating components) that are not covered by either the first or second portions. In <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, the method ends. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The operations described above with respect to the method illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> can be performed in a different order from that described herein. Also, it should be understood that although an &ldquo;End&rdquo; block is shown for the method, it may be continuously performed. </paragraph>
