<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A battery cartridge comprising a housing and one or more primary (nonrechargeable) cells therein. The cell can be a single primary cylindrical cell, desirably a primary lithium cell having a voltage of about 3.0 volts. Alternatively, there can be a pair or plurality of such cells electrically connected in parallel within the cartridge housing. The cartridge housing of the invention has an elongated body with an elongated opening in its surface of sufficient size to allow insertion of one or more cylindrical primary cells therein. The housing can be provided with a disk partition which divides the housing interior into two or more chambers, one for each cell. The cartridge can have overall dimensions similar to that of lithium ion or other rechargeable cartridges used to power small size camcorders or digital cameras. Thus, the battery cartridge of the invention has particular utility as a replacement for rechargeable cartridges for such devices. When the cartridge has been discharged, the cells can be removed from the housing and replaced with fresh cells. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a battery cartridge housing a primary (nonrechargeable) electrochemical cell such as a primary lithium cell, which can be used in place of a rechargeable cartridge. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Digital cameras and camcorders and other digital imaging devices are becoming smaller in size. For example, camcorders which are only slightly larger than a person&apos;s hand, are now available. Such devices typically are provided with a rechargeable battery cartridge or power pack such as a rechargeable lithium ion cartridge. The rechargeable cartridge has a housing designed to fit and lock in place within a receiving cavity within the imaging device to be powered. The negative and positive terminals on the cartridge housing are oriented to contact negative and positive contacts, respectively, within the device to be powered. The cartridge is normally designed to be removed from the device being powered so that it can be recharged and then reinserted or else it can be recharged while locked in place within the device. In earlier camcorders the rechargeable cartridge was typically of a prismatic or rectangular configuration occupying a significant volume. Such rechargeable packs are commercially available and are fairly large, for example, having a width of about 2 inches or larger and length of about 2 to 3 inches or greater. As the size of camcorders and digital cameras have become smaller, the rechargeable cartridge has also become much smaller, reflecting the need for smaller capacity battery cartridges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> To accommodate the smaller battery cartridge, designers have begun to employ small size rechargeable cylindrical cells, such as small cylindrical lithium ion cells, housed therein. Such small size rechargeable lithium ion cells, for example, could typically have a diameter of between about 15 and 18 mm and larger, for example up to about 32 mm and length between about 25 and 50 mm and greater, for example up to about 58 mm. As the imaging devices become even smaller such rechargeable cells could also become smaller. The lithium ion cell when fully charged has a nominal voltage of about 4.0 volts or somewhat greater and an average voltage during discharge of between about 3.6 volts. Such rechargeable cells are sealed within the cartridge housing and are not intended to be removed therefrom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It would be a benefit to provide a nonrechargeble primary power source alternative to rechargeable battery cartridges for small size camcorders and digital cameras. The nonrechargeable power source could provide the user with an alternative to the rechargeable cartridge as it can be used as replacement for such rechargeable cartridge. The availability of such nonrechargeable power source could also provide the manufacturer of the small size imaging device the option of providing the nonrechargeable power source included with sale of the device, instead of providing a more expensive rechargeable cartridge therewith. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is thus desired to provide a primary (nonrechargeable) battery cartridge for small size camcorders, digital cameras and other small size direct current powered electronic devices, wherein the primary cartridge has a voltage preferably about 3.0 volts and can be used interchangeably with a rechargeable cartridge of similar size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is desired to provide a primary battery cartridge for small size camcorders, digital cameras and other small size electronic devices, wherein primary cells, preferably primary cylindrical cells, can be inserted easily into the cartridge housing and easily removed therefrom when discharged. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A principal aspect of the invention is directed to providing a primary (nonrechargeable) battery cartridge that can be used as a primary power source or as a substitution for a rechargeable cartridge for powering small size digital imaging devices such as handheld camcorders or digital cameras. The term &ldquo;primary cartridge&rdquo; or &ldquo;primary cell&rdquo; or &ldquo;primary battery&rdquo; as used hereinafter shall be understood to mean a battery cartridge or electrochemical cell which is not intended to be rechargeable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The primary (nonrechargeable) battery cartridge of the invention is characterized by having a housing body with an opening therein, preferably an elongated opening, of sufficient size to allow insertion of one or more cylindrical primary (nonrechargeable) cells into the housing interior. The opening is of sufficient size so that when the cell has been discharged, it can easily be removed from the housing and replaced with a fresh cell. The housing is desirably of a nonconductive material such as plastic which can be readily molded by injection or insert molding. The housing is preferably of a single piece integral construction. The housing has an elongated substantially cylindrical shape so that it can accommodate and hug at least a major portion of the surface one cylindrical primary cell placed therein with little, if any, wasted volume. The housing preferably avoids the need for hinged doors and removable covers and the like in order to gain access to the housing interior. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The cartridge housing preferably has a substantially cylindrical body which terminates in a pair of opposing end surfaces with a substantially cylindrical surface integrally formed therebetween. There is preferably an elongated opening taking the form of a cut out portion within the body of housing to allow easy insertion of one or more primary cells therethrough and into the housing interior. Such design avoids the need to have hinged doors and the like attached to the body or end of the housing which must be opened before the cell can be inserted within the housing. However, as an alternative, the housing could be provided with a hinged door, for example, at an end of the housing or as part of the housing body. Opening of such door could allow access to the housing interior and placement of one or more primary cell therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> There are a pair of electrical contacts within the housing, formed of a strip of conductive metal such as copper or brass. One of said conductive contact strips is intended to contact the negative terminal and the other intended to contact the positive terminal of a cylindrical primary cell placed within the housing. Each of the conductive contact strips terminates in an exposed conductive portion which extends to the outside surface of the housing. One of the exposed conductive portions provides the negative and the other provides the positive terminal on the cartridge housing exterior (cartridge housing positive and negative terminals). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The battery cartridge preferably further comprises a disk within the cartridge housing interior. The disk is located between the opposing housing end surfaces and preferably oriented perpendicular to the housing central longitudinal axis. The disk has an opening therethrough. A metal contact strip can be held in place within the disk opening. Such metal contact strip contacts the positive terminal of a cell within the housing and is in electrical contact with the cartridge housing positive terminal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> When a primary cell is inserted into the cartridge housing, a primary battery cartridge is formed with the exposed negative contact on the housing exterior (cartridge housing negative terminal) in electrical contact with the cell&apos;s negative terminal and the exposed positive contact on the housing exterior (cartridge housing positive terminal) in electrical contact with the cell&apos;s positive terminal. The overall shape and size of the primary cartridge of the invention can be modified as needed to conform to the overall shape and size of a rechargeable cartridge intended for insertion into the receiving cavity of any specific small sized camcorder or handheld digital camera or other small direct current powered device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In a specific aspect the cartridge housing of the invention can be of sufficient size to accommodate a cylindrical primary cell typically having a diameter of between about 15 and 18 mm and larger, for example up to about 32 mm and length between about 25 and 50 mm and greater, for example, up to about 58 mm. In a preferred embodiment the cartridge housing of the invention is of sufficient size to accommodate a primary cylindrical lithium cell of standard size designated in the art as a <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>A size which corresponds to a cell of 15 mm diameter and 34 mm length. Such cells are characterized by having a lithium metal anode and manganese dioxide or lithiated manganese dioxide cathode and an operating voltage of about 3.0 volts. Alternatively, the cartridge housing of the invention can be sized to accommodate small sized primary lithium cells, for example a CR2 size cell which has a diameter of about 14 mm and length of about 26 mm. It will be appreciated that the housing size can be adjusted as required to house primary lithium cells of other cylindrical sizes either larger or smaller than the above two representative sizes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In another specific aspect the cartridge housing of the invention can be designed to have an internal volume large enough to house two cylindrical lithium cells which are connected in parallel within the housing. Such cells are also easily inserted into the housing interior preferably through an integrally formed elongated opening in the housing body. The use of two or more primary cells connected in parallel extends the capacity of the cartridge. Alternatively, two or more primary cells could be inserted into the housing interior through an elongated opening in the cartridge housing and the cells connected in series within the cartridge housing to obtain a higher voltage. Although the cartridge housing described herein is intended in its preferred embodiment to house cylindrical primary cells, the concept of the invention extends to other primary cell shapes with the overall shape and size of the housing modified to accommodate such other shaped cells. For example, the cartridge housing of the invention overall shape and size could be modified to accommodate one or more prismatic or rectangular shaped primary cells or one or more button shaped primary cells or one or more elongated noncylindrical shaped primary cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In a specific aspect the cartridge housing comprises a partition disk having an opening therethrough. The disk is positioned within the housing interior and is preferably perpendicular to the cartridge housing central longitudinal axis. The disk can divide the housing interior into two compartments. The disk can have positioned in the opening therein a metal strip which is in electrical contact with the exposed cartridge housing positive terminal. A first primary cell can be placed into one of the compartments through an elongated opening in the housing body and a second primary cell can be placed into the other compartment through said same elongated opening in the housing body. The cells are aligned head to head with the cells positive terminals contacting opposite sides of said metal strip therebetween being held in place by said partition disk. Such metal strip thereby electrically connects each of the cell&apos;s positive terminals to the cartridge housing positive terminal. Each of the cell&apos;s negative terminals are electrically connected to the cartridge housing negative terminal. The two primary cell&apos;s are thus connected in parallel. If the cell are primary lithium cells the cartridge voltage will be about 3.0 volts.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A preferred embodiment of the cartridge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the invention is shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and Fig. The cartridge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> before a cell <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is inserted therein. The same cartridge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with a cell <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> therein is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>. Cartridge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is designed to accommodate a single primary (nonrechargeable) cell, for example, a cylindrical primary lithium cell having a voltage of about 3.0 volts. The cartridge can have substantially the same overall size as a rechargeable cartridge intended for insertion into the receiving cavity of a small size camcorder or digital camera. In such case the cartridge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the invention with single primary (nonrechargeable) cell therein can be used in place of or interchangeably with the rechargeable cartridge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Cartridge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises an elongated housing <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> comprising an elongated housing body <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> which terminates with integrally formed closed front end <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and opposing closed rear end <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Preferably, housing body <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and integrally formed ends <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are formed of an electrically insulating material, preferably a plastic. Housing body <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can be formed of a durable plastic such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinylchloride, and other plastics, preferably thermoplastics which are readily moldable by injection molding. It is not intended to limit housing <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to any particular plastic material, since a suitable material can be selected from a wide array of conventional plastics. The elongated housing body <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is formed of contoured surface <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> defining a substantially hollow interior space <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> which is sufficiently large to accommodate at least one primary cell <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>) therein. Contoured surface <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> of housing body <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is preferably a cylindrical surface or partially cylindrical. In this regard housing body <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> can be described as having a circular or more preferably a partially circular or semicircular configuration in cross section take along a plane perpendicular to the central longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>. Desirably elongated housing body <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> has a cylindrical or circular curvature over between about &frac13; and &frac12; of its circumference with the remaining portion <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> of the housing circumference being substantially flat along the length of the housing body <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Housing body <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is characterized in that it preferably has an elongated opening <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> in its body <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Opening <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> appears as an elongated cut out portion in the contoured or cylindrical surface <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. Opening <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is sufficiently large to allow insertion of a primary cylindrical cell <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> therethrough so that it can lie within the housing interior space <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>. Cell <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is inserted into the interior <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> of the housing so that the cell&apos;s positive and negative terminals are in electrical contact, with exposed positive and negative terminals <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, respectively, on housing <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The cartridge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can then be inserted into a receiving cavity of a digital camcorder or digital camera and the like and is then ready to power such device. When the cell <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> becomes discharged, cartridge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be removed from the device being powered and the cell can be easily removed from the housing interior <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> through opening <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and replaced with a fresh cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Cartridge housing <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> contains a pair of separate electrically conductive strips of metal <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> therein, typically of plated steel or bronze alloy but may also be of copper or brass or other conductive metal. The conductive strips <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are separated and do not contact each other. The conductive strip <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is intended to be in electrical contact with the negative terminal of primary cell <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> when the cell is inserted into the interior <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> of housing <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The conductive strip <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is intended to be in electrical contact with the positive terminal of cell <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> conductive strip <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> comprises an elongated body portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> which can run parallel to the housing central longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>. The conductive body portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> terminates at one end in curved flange surface <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> which can be perpendicular or substantially perpendicular to the housing central longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>. The conductive curved surface <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is preferably convex curved when viewed from housing front end <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and remains within the housing interior <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> at a position adjacent to the housing rear end <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Curved surface <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> has resiliency when physical pressure is applied to it from within the housing interior. Conductive strip <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> terminates at the opposite end in a flanged portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> which protrudes from the housing front end <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and is thus exposed to the external environment. Similarly, conductive strip <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> has an elongated body portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> which runs parallel to housing central longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>. The conductive body portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> terminates at one end in a positive contact flange <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> which is oriented perpendicular to the housing central longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>. Positive contact flange <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> can be flat or curved and is intended to contact the positive terminal of a cell <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> inserted into the housing <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Contact flange <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> can be located proximate the front end <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of housing <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, but can be displaced within the housing interior a short distance from said front end <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Preferably, when only one cell <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is inserted into interior <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> of housing <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, contact flange <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is located a distance which is between about 5 and 25% of the length of housing <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> as measured from closed end <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Desirably, contact flange <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> can be supported by an insulator disk <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> placed within the housing interior <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> in a position perpendicular to the cartridge central longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>. Support disk <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> has a circumventing outer edge <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and preferably a hollow center <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>. Contact flange <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> can be fastened or molded to disk edge <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> in order to keep flange <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> in a rigid upright position as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Conductive body portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> terminates at the opposite end in a flanged portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which protrudes from the housing front end <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and is thus exposed to the external environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The cell <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> can be inserted through opening <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> into the interior <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> of housing <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> resulting in cartridge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with cell <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> therein as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>. The cell <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is inserted so that its negative terminal faces and contacts the curved conductive flange <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the cell&apos;s positive terminal faces and contacts conductive flange <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. Thus, when the cell <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is inserted within housing <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> exposed housing terminal <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is in electrical contact with the cell&apos;s negative terminal and the exposed housing terminal <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is in electrical contact with the cell&apos;s positive terminal. Cartridge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can then be inserted into the receiving cavity (not shown) of a camcorder or digital camera and the like in place of the rechargeable cartridge for such device. Care is taken to position one of the housing terminals, for example, the positive terminal <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> at a location which is offset or different from the normal positive contact location on the rechargeable cartridge which the cartridge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is intended to replace. This assures that any attempt to recharge the cartridge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the invention with standard recharging equipment will be ineffective, since it is not intended that the cell <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> within cartridge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> be rechargeable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The primary (non-rechargeable) electrochemical cell <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> inserted into cartridge housing <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> can be a cell which is commercially available. Such cell, for example, can be a primary lithium cell designated as a Li/MnO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>primary lithium cell. The cell, typically of cylindrical configuration, is available in a number of standard sizes. Such cell has an anode comprising lithium and a cathode comprising manganese dioxide. Lithium primary (nonrechargeable) cells are conventionally formed of spirally wound material comprising an anode formed of a sheet of lithium, a cathode formed of a coating of cathode active material comprising manganese dioxide on a conductive metal substrate (cathode substrate) and a sheet of separator material therebetween, as shown, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,707,421. The electrolyte used in a primary Li/MnO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>cell is formed of a lithium salt dissolved in an organic solvent. Typically, the salt is lithium perchlorate (LiClO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>) or lithium trifluoromethanesulfonate (LiCF<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>). Other salts which are conventionally used include LiPF<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>, LiAsF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>and LiCF<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and LiBF<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Such primary (nonrechargeable) lithium cell is known and in widespread commercial use. These cells are commonly available in a number of standard sizes typically of cylindrical configuration. For example, the cell can be in the form of button cell or elongated cylindrical cell having the size of an AA size cell (14&times;49 mm). The primary lithium cell are available in other standard size, for example, a standard size CR2 cylindrical cell (14&times;26 mm) or CR123A size cylindrical cell (15&times;34 mm). The standard AA cylindrical cell, the CR2 size cylindrical cell, and the CR123A size cylindrical cell are standard cell sizes referenced in the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) battery specification or in the International Electrochemical Commission (IEC) battery specification. Such primary lithium cell has an operating voltage of about 3.0 volts which is twice that of conventional Zn/MnO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>alkaline cells and also has higher energy density (watt-hrs per cm<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>of cell volume) than that of a zinc/MnO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>alkaline cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In many services, it has been determined herein that the cartridge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the invention containing a primary lithium cell, typically having a voltage of about 3.0 volts can be used to replace a rechargeable cartridge containing a lithium ion rechargeable cell, typically having an average voltage between about 2.8 and 3.5 volts. Lithium ion rechargeable cells are in widespread commercial use and are a well recognizeable type of cell. The negative electrode of a lithium ion cell typically comprises carbon with lithium ions intercalated (inserted) therein. The term &ldquo;lithium ion cell&rdquo; as used herein refers to a secondary (rechargeable cell) characterized by the transfer of lithium ions from negative electrode to positive electrode upon cell discharge and from the positive electrode to the negative electrode upon cell charging. During discharge, electrons are released from the negative electrode intercalation compound to balance the positive charge loss due to release of lithium ions therefrom. During charging, electrons are gained by the negative electrode to balance the positive charge gain due to lithium ions being reabsorbed by the negative electrode intercalation compound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The following is a specific non limiting example, illustrating one practical application of the cartridge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>) of the invention. The cartridge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has an overall length of about 55 mm and overall width of about 20 mm and depth 20 mm. A CR123A size (15 mm&times;34 mm) cylindrical primary (nonrechargeable) lithium cell <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is inserted into housing interior <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> through elongated opening <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. The elongated opening <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> can have a length of about 40 mm and width of about 16 mm so that a CR123A size primary lithium cell can be inserted therein. Such embodiment of cartridge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the invention can be used as a replacement, for example, for the rechargeable lithium ion cartridge having the trade designation NP80 from Fuji Film Company. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Cartridge housing <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> can be provided optionally with indents <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and groove <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> located on the side of the housing in a position the same or similar to that used on the NP80 (Fuji Film Co.) rechargeable cartridge. There can be a mating runner within the receiving cavity of the device being powered (not shown) which mates with groove <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. Thus, groove <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> makes it easier for the cartridge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to slide into a receiving cavity of a camcorder or camera or other device to be powered. There can also be protrusions within the battery receiving cavity of the device being powered which interlock with indents <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>thereby holding the cartridge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in place within the receiving cavity. It will be appreciated that such groove <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and indents <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>can be altered or substituted with equivalents depending on the shape and configuration of the battery receiving cavity of the device being powered. Thus, by way of non limiting example, cartridge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the invention can have the same overall dimensions and interlock features as the NP80 rechargeable cartridge or other such similar sized cartridges. In the specific embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 1</cross-reference>A, cartridge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the invention can be used as a replacement for the NP80 rechargeable cartridge which is presently used to power the small sized digital camera designated model Fine Pix 6800 digital camera from Fuji Film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> By way of another specific example, the overall size of the opening <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> in cartridge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be made smaller, for example, having a length of 33 mm, and width of 16 mm. Such size cartridge can accommodate a standard CR2 size primary lithium cylindrical cell (14 mm&times;26 mm). Such cartridge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the invention can be used to power camcorders or digital cameras and the like wherein the battery receiving cavity of the device to be powered is sized to accommodate the cartridge. Alternatively, the length of the cartridge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> accommodating the primary lithium CR2 cell can be extended to about 55 mm so that it can be used as a replacement for the lithium ion rechargeable NP80 cartridge from Fuji Film Co. </paragraph>
