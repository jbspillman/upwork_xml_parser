<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to packet-switched computer network environments and, more particularly, to methods, apparatuses and systems allowing a network service provider to deliver application performance management services to its customers. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Businesses are growing increasingly dependent on networked applications. These applications are deployed across intranet, extranet and Internet connections to effect essential communications with workers, business partners and customers. As the number of users, applications and external traffic increases, however, network congestion forms and impairs business application performance. Moreover, as business enterprises become more dependent on the Internet and more sensitive to network congestion, the amount of network traffic from unsanctioned activities, like casual web browsing and on-line shopping, is growing dramatically, exacerbating network congestion problems. Enterprise network managers, therefore, are challenged with determining the volume, origin and nature of network traffic to align network resources with business priorities and applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Today, providers of network services have recognized that many business customers have limited capital and human resources to respond to changing business network requirements. In response, they have developed a portfolio of value-added managed network services (MNS) that allow their customers to out-source key design, deployment and management functions of intranet, extranet and Internet connectivity. Although these services provide managed connectivity for businesses, they are abstracted from and ignorant of the network traffic that flows across the service. When a customer experiences an application performance problem, it is difficult to determine whether the problem is induced by the MNS service or the customer&apos;s own computing and network infrastructure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> This lack of visibility and control of application performance over the MNS causes the service provider to spend resources to engage and pinpoint the problem. This often requires the service provider to send skilled personnel with diagnostic equipment to the customer&apos;s site to determine if the problem emanates from the provider&apos;s or the customer&apos;s network environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Currently, business customers suffering from network congestion and poor business application performance respond with several alternative solutions. The primary method of responding to poor business application performance is to increase network bandwidth. To many business, however, this approach is cost prohibitive due to the high recurring costs of bandwidth. Moreover, adding incremental bandwidth often fails because of certain forms of network traffic-usually bursty, less critical or non-sanctioned traffic-that aggressively consume the added bandwidth and leave more well-behaved business applications with little to no performance improvement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A second approach is to manage network traffic and application performance by employing bandwidth management functionality using existing network infrastructure equipment (e.g., routers), if possible, or by deploying new bandwidth management-specific equipment. This requires the business to make substantial capital and operational investment in order to implement, manage and maintain bandwidth management technology internally. For example, to ensure the performance of their critical business applications and to control bandwidth resources, some businesses deploy bandwidth management platforms at the edge of their intranet, extranet and Internet connections. This involves installation of bandwidth management hardware followed by a process of discovering what traffic is on the network; analyzing the traffic to determine utilization and relative impact on business application performance; implementing control policies to effect the desired performance outcome; and, then setting thresholds to alert network managers to any performance degradations. For many business, however, the capital and human resource cost of deploying and managing a bandwidth management solution internally is too great. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In light of the foregoing, a need exists for methods, apparatuses and systems that allow a network service provider to offer application performance management services as an out-sourced service. At present, however, the two closest alternatives available to network service providers fall short of the capabilities necessary to support an application performance management service. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> WAN Service-Level Management Services: Service providers offering wide-area network service-level management solutions do have the ability to monitor traffic flowing across its customers intranet, extranet and Internet connections. However, their monitoring abilities are limited to the different types of network protocols and do not provide adequate visibility into the type, nature, and origin of business applications and traffic from sanctioned and non-sanctioned activities. Moreover, WAN Service-Level Management solutions are completely passive and offer no means of network traffic control rendering the service incapable of resolving traffic congestion and application performance problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Managed Network Services (MNS): Business customers who choose to out-source their entire WAN infrastructure often deploy MNS offerings. MNS provides all of the necessary network connectivity and management infrastructure needed to connect remote business offices together, including WAN circuits, routers and on-going management services. These services, however, are connectivity-driven and are not intended to align directly with application productivity needs. Therefore, they lack the necessary bandwidth management technology for peering deep into network traffic to isolate and control the stream of application traffic with differing business priorities. MNS services also lack the policy-based management and accompanying infrastructure to mass provision and manage business customer applications as an out-sourced function. </paragraph>

Data analysis server <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> operates on data stored in network traffic database <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> to generate reports detailing application performance and bandwidth utilization across access link <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, data analysis server <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> generates reports on an on-demand basis. In another embodiment, data analysis server <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is configured to generate reports on a periodic basis (e.g., daily, weekly, and/or monthly). In one embodiment, managed network operations center <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> transmits such reports in e-mails, attachments to e-mails, or any other suitable data push mechanism. In another embodiment, such reports are viewable as web pages or other file types accessed by a network administrator using, for example, a browser at host <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, a network administrator can access network traffic database <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> to produce reports that include the traffic classes and time intervals of interest to the administrator. In one embodiment, data analysis server <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> generates graphs and charts providing a high-level view of network traffic statistics. In one embodiment, network traffic statistics are stored in a management information base (MIB) accessible to any Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) platform. In one embodiment, bandwidth management device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> includes a customer portal featuring SNMP functionality that allows a network administrator at customer site <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to generate and view reports detailing bandwidth utilization and other network traffic statistics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The reporting functionality of data analysis server <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> allows network administrators to view reports detailing application performance and bandwidth utilization and/or compliance with service-level goals in order to determine if adjustments to bandwidth management policies should be made. Such reports can include average and peak traffic levels, top bandwidth consumers both as to users and applications, application response time (divided into time spent in transit v. time spent on server), comparisons between actual performance and service-level goals, clients and servers with worst performance statistics, per-application statistics, per-user statistics, and network efficiency. As more fully described in co-pending application Ser. No. 09/1 98,090, supra, network traffic can be classified according to layers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the OSI networking model, for example, by application, protocol, port number, URL, host name, host lists, DiffServ setting, IP precedence bits, IP or MAC address, Oracle database, Citrix published application, and more. In one embodiment, the listing and format of network traffic classes in the report is configurable by the enterprise customer. In one embodiment, the list of traffic classes is arranged in a hierarchical display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> C. Enterprise Customer </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, a typical enterprise customer includes at least one customer site <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> running networked applications via wide area network <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> in connection with at least one enterprise applications site <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and/or out-sourced applications site <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Customer site <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can be an enterprises&apos;s headquarters or a branch office. Of course, the present invention can operate in connection with multiple customer sites associated with one or more business enterprises. As <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows, customer site <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> remotely accesses data and applications residing on servers <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> via wide area network <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> at remote enterprise application site <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and/or out-sourced applications site <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>. As <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows, customer site <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> includes a network <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> linking together hosts <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. Although network <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is shown as an Ethernet network, other types of networks can be used such as a Token Ring network. Hosts <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> can be generally be any computer or computing device running any operating system. Network <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is connected to wide area network <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> via routing device <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and access link <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Wide area network <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> provides a logical connection to remote enterprise applications site <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and out-sourced applications site <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> via access links <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and routing devices <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, respectively. The gateway system of routing devices <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> may also include other functionality such as firewalls, network bridges, and virtual private networks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Access links <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> can be provided by a combination of variety of different devices.

<heading lvl="1">II. Operation </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> A. Deployment of Application Performance Management Services </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Before a network service provider (NSP) can provision application performance management (APM) services for an enterprise customer, it must first perform traffic profiling on all or a statistically significant sampling of the affected enterprise customer sites. Traffic profiling follows the installation of bandwidth management device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, to provide application performance management services to customer site <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, managed network operations center <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> deploys bandwidth management device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> at each managed termination point on the enterprise customer&apos;s WAN connections-here, access link <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, step <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>). Bandwidth management device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> then profiles the network traffic across access link <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to identify bandwidth utilization and application performance (step <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>). In order to gain an accurate network traffic profile, the NSP runs bandwidth management device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in monitor-mode for a statistically sufficient period (e.g., <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> hours). At the end of the monitoring period, the traffic profile data is then uploaded to an application performance reporting system (e.g., device manager server <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and/or data analysis server <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> of managed network operations center <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>) where it can be stored in network traffic database <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> and analyzed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the metrics gleaned from the network traffic profiling process, and used to determine appropriate bandwidth management policies, include: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Traffic Classification: How many different classes of traffic, by type and origin, are running across access link <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. This information is used to segregate and quantify traffic that is business-critical, non-business-critical-but-sanctioned, and non-sanctioned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Bandwidth Utilization: How much bandwidth each class of traffic consume. Measurements include average and peak utilization over a sampling interval. In one embodiment, the sampling interval is less than 1 minute. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Top Talkers/Listeners: What are the ten (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) top traffic transmitters (talkers) and receivers (listeners) from a bandwidth utilization perspective. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Bandwidth Efficiency: Measures the efficiency in which bandwidth is being consumed by measuring the ratio of successfully transmitted to unsuccessfully transmitted packets. A bandwidth efficiency ratio of less than 100% indicates the network is discarding traffic (i.e., packets). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Response-Time: What are the round-trip response-times for each traffic class and their composite response-time components of server and network latency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Managed network operations center <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> then compiles a report detailing application bandwidth utilization and application performance, including some or all of the metrics discussed above, and transmits or otherwise delivers the report to the enterprise customer (e.g., network administrators at customer site <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>) for review. For example, the report could reveal to customer site <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> that a large amount of available bandwidth is consumed by nonsanctioned traffic, such as web browsing or on-line shopping, while critical business applications running between customer site <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and remote enterprise applications site <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> are struggling for bandwidth. Managed network operations center <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> then receives from the enterprise customer a prioritization of applications based on the profiled network traffic (step <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>). The enterprise customer can assign applications to a variety of pre-determined priority categories such as &ldquo;mission critical,&rdquo; &ldquo;average,&rdquo; &ldquo;low,&rdquo; and &ldquo;prohibited.&rdquo; In another embodiment, the enterprise customer can rate applications according to a numerical hierarchy, such as 0 to 7. The enterprise customer may also specify desired performance levels for one or more applications. The enterprise customer can also choose to block certain types of network traffic altogether. In another embodiment, a service level agreement between the MNS provider and the enterprise customer defines the application priorities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Managed network operations center <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> then formulates a set of bandwidth management policies to implement the application priorities received from customer site <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (and/or to comply with an application-based service level agreement) and applies the set to bandwidth management device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>). In another embodiment, customers directly configure all or a subset of available bandwidth management policies by accessing device manager server <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> via customer portal functionality on bandwidth management device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, device manager server <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and/or the customer portal on bandwidth management device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> provides a user interface facilitating the configuration of bandwidth management policies. In one embodiment, the user interface facilitates the selection of a class of network traffic (e.g., on an application-level basis, user-level basis, session-level basis, or other basis) and the association of application performance and/or bandwidth utilization parameters (e.g., priority levels, admissibility, minimum transmission rates, and/or a other bandwidth utilization parameters) with the selected class of network traffic. In one embodiment, bandwidth management device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> includes an IP address which managed network operations center <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> uses to transmit the set of bandwidth management policies. Subsequently, managed network operations center <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> monitors application performance across access link <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> via bandwidth management device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to assess compliance with the priorities of the enterprise customer (step <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> A core step in provisioning application performance management services is the definition of quality of service (QoS) and measurement policies that control how bandwidth management device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> processes and quantifies traffic flowing across access link <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to achieve a desired performance outcome. Bandwidth management policies, in effect, control the flow of traffic in terms of admissibility, relative and absolute priority, and bandwidth reservation and allocation in accordance with business importance. Certain bandwidth management policies define the measure of acceptable service-level thresholds and the desired action to be taken if thresholds are not met. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, bandwidth management policies can be grouped into two functional categories: service envelope and traffic flow policies. As discussed below, in one embodiment, service envelope policies are exclusively configured by personnel at managed network operations center <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, while traffic flow policies can be configured by enterprise customers and/or personnel associated with managed network operations center <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. Service envelope policies, in one embodiment, are cost-driven policies that define the allocation, mapping, billing and mediation of network sources based on price-performance. For example, service providers typically tariff packet-based managed network services on minimum committed bandwidth allocations. Service envelope policies also define how traffic will be mapped from access link <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to backbone network service classes using traffic marking techniques. Service envelope policies are service provider defined and provisioned, and include: committed bandwidth allocation and allowable burst allocation, traffic marking (based, in one embodiment, on Diffserv packet marking standard), billing and accounting, and service-level verification and mediation&mdash;which defines specific service-level component thresholds and what actions are to be taken in the event of a violation. Service-level metrics include: service availability, throughput, efficiency and latency. Traffic flow policies define how traffic is to be controlled on an aggregate and per-flow (e.g., per-user-session or per-TCP-connection) basis. They can be defined by the service provider, customer (i.e., self-provisioned) or jointly depending on service structure. These policies include admission control (e.g., allow, deny, discard traffic), bandwidth reservation, allocation and sharing, as well as absolute (rate-based) and relative transmission priorities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> B. On-going Management of Bandwidth Utilization and Application Performance </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, managed network operations center <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> provides customers with reports detailing application performance and bandwidth utilization levels. In one embodiment, the reports detail application performance and bandwidth utilization levels in relation to the application priorities specified by the enterprise customer. In another embodiment, the reports detail application performance and bandwidth utilization levels in relation to an application-based service level agreement entered into between the enterprise customer and the network services provider. Bandwidth management device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, in one embodiment, includes a customer portal providing a point of interaction with managed network operations center <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the customer portal includes a graphical user interface accessible to an enterprise customer network administrator using browsing software on hosts <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, or <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. Using the customer portal, a network administrator can access the functionality of managed network operations center <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> to change a bandwidth management policy implemented by bandwidth management device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The method shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is illustrative. In one embodiment, device manager server <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> at managed network operations center <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> receives a request to change a bandwidth management policy from a customer enterprise network administrator at customer site <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, step <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>). Device manager server <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> authenticates the administrator by prompting him or her for a password (see step <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>). If the administrator is authenticated, device manager server <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> processes the requested change (step <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>) and applies a new set of bandwidth management policies to bandwidth management device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>). In one embodiment, device manager server <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> also stores the set of bandwidth management policies in bandwidth management device database <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the customer portal provides a division of configurable service parameters between the network services provider and customer site <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Since the configuration and reconfiguration of bandwidth management device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> occurs through a centralized point of administration, managed network operations center <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> can control what parameters (bandwidth management policies) its enterprise customers may configure. For example, the present invention can be configured to allow customer site <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to manage application performance and WAN connectivity within its existing service envelope, while allowing managed network operations center <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> exclusive control over and/or access to bandwidth allocation to customer site <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, bursting, and service-level metrics. In addition, the system allows for mapping of different applications or other classes types of network traffic to different service envelopes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been described with reference to specific embodiments. Other embodiments of the present invention will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art. It is, therefore, intended that the claims set forth below not be limited to the embodiment described above. </paragraph>
