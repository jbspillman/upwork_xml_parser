<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to burner assemblies for paving machines, and particularly a burner assembly including a thermocouple located within an expected flame path of the burner assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Paving machines receive a paving material (e.g., asphalt), and lay a uniform layer of the material on a base or bed. In general, a paving machine includes a vessel or hopper that receives the paving material, and a conveyor that moves the paving material from the hopper to a distributing auger. The distributing auger distributes the paving material on to the bed. A typical paving machine also includes a screed assembly having a heating chamber, a screed plate, tie bars, and a burner assembly that heats the heating chamber. The tie bars move around a pivot allowing the screed plate to contact the paving material. The screed plate receives thermal energy from the burner assembly, and shapes the paving material into a desired form. The burner assembly heats the screed plate to an optimum temperature to facilitate shaping of the paving material. If the screed plate temperature is too low, the paving material may adhere to the screed plate, or may be too hard to work. If the screed plate temperature is too high, the screed plate may warp, or the paving material may be damaged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> As a safety feature, some known fuel burner assemblies included an optical sensor that determines whether a flame is present. The optical sensor generates an output signal when a flame is absent, and when fuel is being provided to the heating chamber. The output signal is fed to a fuel valve, causing the valve to close, and preventing a fuel introduction. One problem with optical sensors is that soot and other particles often stick to the photoelectric cells of the sensor. This results in the optical sensor becoming &ldquo;blinded.&rdquo; A second problem with optical sensors is that the sensor may accidentally sense extraneous light signifying a flame when no flame is being produced. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The invention provides a burner assembly for heating a screed plate of a screed assembly connected to a frame of a paving machine. The screed assembly includes a heating chamber adjacent to the screed plate. The burner assembly includes a blower that moves air into the heating chamber, and a fuel injection system that has a fuel valve. The fuel injection system introduces fuel to the heating chamber. The burner assembly also includes an igniter that ignites the fuel to produce a flame, a thermocouple positioned within an expected flame path, and a controller. The thermocouple generates a thermocouple voltage having a relationship to a temperature surrounding a junction of the thermocouple, and the controller operates the fuel valve based in part on the thermocouple voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The burner assembly uses a thermocouple for sensing the flame. The thermocouple is positioned substantially within the expected flame path, and generates a signal functionally related to a sensed temperature. The generated signal is then analyzed to determine whether a flame exists. Unlike the optical sensor used with known burner assemblies, extraneous light or lack of light due to particle buildup does not effect the thermocouple. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments of the invention, the burner assembly also includes a unique temperature sensing circuit. The temperature sensing circuit includes an amplifier, and a thermocouple that produces a thermocouple voltage. The amplifier includes a first input pin that receives the thermocouple voltage, and a first power pin that receives a current. The amplifier controls an amplitude of the current provided to the amplifier based on a relationship to the thermocouple voltage. The temperature sensing circuit also includes a resistor having a first end connected to a power supply, and a second end connected to the amplifier at the first power pin. The resistor receives the current, and develops a first voltage at the second end. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment the invention provides a method of controlling a burner assembly connected to a frame of a paving machine. The method includes providing a thermocouple having a thermocouple junction, positioning the thermocouple junction within an expected flame path, generating a signal being functionally related to a temperature surrounding the thermocouple junction, analyzing the thermocouple voltage, and generating an output when the analyzed signal signifies a non-lit fuel condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Other features and advantages of the invention will become apparent by consideration of the detailed description and accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Before any embodiments of the invention are explained, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and the arrangement of components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the following drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or of being carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology used herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting. The use of &ldquo;including,&rdquo; &ldquo;comprising,&rdquo; or &ldquo;having&rdquo; and variations thereof herein is meant to encompass the items listed thereafter and equivalents thereof as well as additional items. In the figures, common elements are designated with the same reference numerals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> A paving machine <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The paving machine includes a frame <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, a plurality of wheels <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, a vessel or hopper <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>, a conveyor <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, a distributing auger (not shown), a screed assembly <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>, and one or more burner assemblies <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. The wheels <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> rotate with respect to the frame <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, and support the frame <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> above a bed <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>. The hopper <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> is connected to the frame <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, and holds a paving material (e.g., asphalt, etc.) used for creating a layer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. The conveyor <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is connected to the frame <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, and moves the paving material from the hopper <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> to the distributing auger. The distributing auger is connected to the frame <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, and distributes the paving material on to the bed <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>. The floating screed assembly <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> rotates around a pivot <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> such that a screed plate <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> may contact the distributed paving material. The screed plate <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> works or forms the distributed paving material into a desired shape or form. The screed assembly <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> also includes one or more heating chambers <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> heated by the one or more burner assembles <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The one or more burner assemblies <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> are connected to the frame <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, and are operable to heat one or more heating chamber <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> with a flame <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>), respectively. The flame <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> has an expected flame path <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>. Although multiple burner assemblies may be used, to simplify the description herein, only one burner assembly <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and one chamber <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the burner assembly <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> includes a blower <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, such as a fan, that moves air into the heating chamber <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>, and a fuel injection system <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> that provides fuel into the heating chamber <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>. The fuel injection system includes a fuel valve <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, and a fuel injector <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>. The fuel valve <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> has a closed state and an open state, and controls the amount of fuel provided to the fuel injector <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>. The fuel injector <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> controllably disperses or introduces fuel to the heating chamber <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>. The blower <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and the fuel injection system <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> create an air/fuel mixture. The burner assembly <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> further includes an igniter <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> that ignites the air/fuel mixture resulting in a flame <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> that provides thermal energy. As is known in the art, the intensity and quality of the flame <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is determined by the amount of fuel being passed through the fuel valve <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, and the amount of air (specifically O<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) being moved by the blower <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The heating chamber <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> includes a flame deflector <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> that directs the flame away from the screed plate <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. This avoids direct heating of the screed plate <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, which may damage the screed plate <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. Directing the flame into the heating chamber <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> results in more uniform heating of the screed plate <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The burner assembly <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> also includes a thermocouple <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, a first signal converter <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight>, a controller <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, a chamber temperature sensor <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight>, an input device <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, and an output device <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight>. The thermocouple <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is placed within the heating chamber <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>, and is substantially within the expected flame path <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>. For the embodiment described herein, the thermocouple <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight> is a K-type thermocouple; however, other thermocouples may be used with the invention. The thermocouple <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight> includes a junction <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, and generates a small voltage (referred to as a &ldquo;thermocouple&rdquo; voltage) that varies as the temperature of the junction <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> (referred to as a &ldquo;junction&rdquo; temperature) varies. The junction temperature is substantially identical to the temperature surrounding the junction. If junction <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> is within the flame <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, then the junction temperature is substantially identical to the temperature of the flame <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the thermocouple <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> creates a thermocouple voltage signal functionally related to the temperature of the flame when the air/fuel mixture is ignited or lit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> For the embodiment shown, the thermocouple voltage signal is provided to the first signal converter <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight>. As is discussed in further detail below, the first signal converter <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight> receives a current from the controller <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, and controls the amplitude of the current based on the thermocouple voltage. More specifically, the first signal converter <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight> superimposes the signal created by the thermocouple voltage on to a current provided by the controller <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The second temperature sensor <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight> measures an ambient temperature of the heating chamber <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> a position away from the flame <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, and generates a chamber temperature signal. The ambient temperature of the chamber <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> is functionally related to the temperature of the screed plate <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. The output signal of the second temperature sensor <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight> is provided to the controller <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight> for analysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In general, the controller <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> provides a current to the first signal conditioner <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight>, receives the superimposed signal generated by the thermocouple <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, receives the chamber temperature signal from the chamber temperature sensor <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight>, receives one or more inputs from the input device <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, analyzes the various inputs, and controls the blower <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the fuel valve <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, igniter <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, and output device <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> in response to the analysis of the inputs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As schematically shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the controller <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> includes a second signal converter <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight>, a processing unit <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>, and a memory <highlight><bold>275</bold></highlight>. The second signal converter <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight> (discussed in detail below) converts the superimposed signal into a conditioned signal. The conditioned signal has a voltage range (e.g., zero VDC to 5 VDC) and is provided to the processing unit <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Although the first signal converter <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight> is external to the controller <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> and the second signal converter <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight> is internal to the controller <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, other arrangements are envisioned. For example, the first and second signal converters <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight> may be combined into a single signal conditioner external to the controller. Similarly, the first and second signal conditioners <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight> may be combined into one circuit internal to the controller <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. In addition, other signal conditioners are possible for some aspects of the invention. For example, a signal conditioner having a cold-junction reference may be used to receive the thermocouple voltage, and to generate the conditioned signal provided to the processing unit for analysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Exemplary first and second signal converters <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight> are schematically shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the first signal converter <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight> includes first and second input terminals <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>, an amplifier <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, resistors R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and first and second output terminals <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>. The thermocouple <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is connected to the amplifier <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> via the first and second input terminals <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>. The amplifier <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> includes two input pins <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, two power pins <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, and output pin <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>. For the embodiment shown, a first end of the thermocouple <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is connected to input pin <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> and a second end of the resistor R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The second end of the thermocouple <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is connected to ground. The second end of resistor R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is also connected to ground. The output of amplifier <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> is connected to a first end of resistor R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and to the input terminal <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> of amplifier <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. The second end of resistor R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is connected to ground. The power pin <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> is connected to the first output terminal <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, and the power pin <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> is connected to ground. The first and second output terminals <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> are connected to third and fourth input terminals <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> of the second signal converter <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight>. Capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is connected across the first and second outputs of the first signal converter, and provides filtering of the output signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> During operation of the paving machine <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the thermocouple voltage is provided to the first signal converter <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight> at the first and second input terminals <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>. The thermocouple voltage, which is referenced to ground, is provided to input pin <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight>. The amplifier <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> receives power at power pin <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> from the controller <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. The power received from the controller <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> powers the amplifier <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> such that the power consumed by the amplifier <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> is functionally related to the thermocouple voltage applied to the amplifier <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. This results in a varying current being supplied to the amplifier <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, where the amplitude of the current is functionally related (e.g., proportional) to the thermocouple voltage. For the exemplary embodiment shown, the current may vary proportionally to the voltage applied to the input pin <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight>. For a specific example, if the voltage produced by the thermocouple increases by 1 mV, then the current increases by 0.1 mA. Accordingly, the first signal converter <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight> superimposes or shapes a signal on to the current provided from the controller <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. That is, the same power signal used to power the amplifier <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> is used to carry a signal functionally related to the thermocouple voltage. By superimposing the signal of the thermocouple voltage on to the current, only two terminals are required for connecting the first signal converter <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight> to the controller <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the first signal converter <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight> may &ldquo;trick&rdquo; the controller <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> into believing the first signal converter <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight> is connected to an optical sensor. By &ldquo;tricking&rdquo; the controller <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, the thermocouple <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and first signal converter <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight> may be retrofitted with the controllers of the prior art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the first and second output terminals <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> are connected to the third and fourth input terminals <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> of the second signal converter <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight>. The second signal converter <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight> includes the first and second input terminals <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, one or more power terminals to receive a power from a source Vcc (e.g., 5 VDC), resistor R<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, reference voltage source <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight>, differential amplifier <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>, filter <highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight>, and scaler <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The voltage source Vcc provides power to the first signal converter <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight> via resistor R<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and output terminal <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. As was discussed above, the first signal conditioner <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight> superimposes a signal on to the current of the power provided to the first signal conditioner. The varying current develops a varying voltage drop across resistor R<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. The varying voltage drop results in a voltage signal proportional to the varying current and, consequently, is functionally related to the thermocouple voltage. The varying voltage developed across resistor R<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> (also referred to a first voltage) is provided to the differential amplifier <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The differential amplifier <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> also receives a reference voltage from the reference voltage source <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight>. The differential amplifier <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> compares the varying voltage developed across resistor <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> with the voltage provided by the reference voltage source <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight>, and generates a second or difference voltage proportional to the difference of the two voltages. The second voltage is provided to the filter <highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight>, which filters noise from the difference voltage and attenuates flame &ldquo;flicker&rdquo; effects. The filtered difference voltage is provided to a scaler <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>. The scaler <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> scales the voltage to a desired voltage scale (e.g., 0-5 VDC), and provides the scaled voltage (also referred to as the &ldquo;conditioned&rdquo; voltage) to the processing unit <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> for analysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The memory <highlight><bold>275</bold></highlight> includes one or more software modules having instructions, and the processing unit <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> retrieves, interprets, and executes the instructions of the one or more software modules to control the burner assembly <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment of the invention, the processing unit <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> is a PIC16C74 microcontroller manufactured by Microchip Technology. However, other microcontrollers may be used in the invention. In addition, the processing unit <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> may alternatively be constructed with other analog and/or digital logic circuitry, and may include integrated and/or discrete circuit elements. Furthermore, the controller <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> may include other processing units for controlling other aspects of the paving machine <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, and the processing unit <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> and/or the controller <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> may include other elements (e.g., one or more analog-to-digital converters, one or more drivers, one or more power supplies, etc.) that would be apparent to one skilled in the art from the description contained herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The input device <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> provides an interface between the operator and the controller <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, and allows an operator to provide inputs to the controller <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. Of course the input device <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> may be multiple input devices, and may be part of a large interface that allows the operator to control the paving machine <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Example input devices <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> include switches, levers, dials (including wheels), knobs, push buttons (including keyboards and keypads), pedals, touch devices (including touch screens) and other similar input devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The output device <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> provides an interface between the controller <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> and the operator, and allows the controller <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> to provide outputs to the operator. For example, the output device <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> may be able to provide an alarm to the operator upon receiving an alarm signal. Of course the output device <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> may be multiple output devices, and may be part of a large interface that allows the paving machine <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to communicate with the operator. Example output devices <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> include display lights (including light-emitting diodes, incandescent bulbs, discharge lamps, fluorescent bulbs, etc.), display screens (including touch screens, LCDs, etc.), and sound devices (e.g., a speaker, tone generating devices, buzzers, etc.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In operation, an operator activates the paving machine <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, and a power is provided to the controller <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. Upon receiving power, the processing unit <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> performs appropriate initialization operations, and obtains, interprets, and executes the one or more software modules from the memory <highlight><bold>275</bold></highlight>. The operator controls the paving machine by providing inputs to the one or more input devices <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> as is known in the art. For example, the operator may activate a switch resulting in the paving machine <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> paving a bed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> As noted above the machine <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> shapes the parts material. During the shaping process, the screed plate <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is controllably heated to a temperature that optimally heats the paving material for shaping. To heat the heating chamber <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>, and consequently the screed plate <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, the controller <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> provides a signal to the blower <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, and to the fuel injection system <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> that results in a mixture of fuel and air being introduced into the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>. The controller <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> also provides a signal to the igniter <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> that results in ignition of the air/fuel mixture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The controller <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> receives a chamber temperature signal having a relationship to the temperature of the heating chamber <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>, and a thermocouple voltage having a relationship to the temperature surrounding the thermocouple junction <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> (i.e., the temperature of the expected flame path <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>). The thermocouple voltage is provided to the first signal converter <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight>, which receives a current form the controller <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, and produces a signal superimposed on the current. The controller analyzes the signal that is superimposed on the current. For the embodiment shown, the second signal converter <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight> converts the current signal into a first voltage, compares the first voltage with a reference voltage, and scales the difference signal to a desired scale. The resulting scaled voltage (also referred to as the conditioned voltage) is functionally related to the temperature surrounding the thermocouple junction <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, and is provided to the processing unit <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> for analysis. The processing unit controls the air/fuel mixture to provide a desired temperature, and an optimal burn consistency based on the inputs received from the input device, the temperature of the chamber, and the temperature of the expected flame path <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The signal provided by the thermocouple may indicate that the air/fuel mixture has not been ignited or has extinguished. If the fuel is not properly ignited, the controller <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> generates an output. The output may be provided to the fuel valve <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> that results in closure of the fuel valve <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. The output may also be provided to the one or more output devices <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> to generate an audio or visual alarm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> For one embodiment, the conditioned signal is sampling at a sampled rate (e.g., 30 msec), and is analyzed at an analysis rate (e.g., 1 sec) for determining whether the air/fuel mixture is lit. An exemplary embodiment for performing sampling is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, and an exemplary embodiment for performing analysis to determine whether the flame is lit is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. For the embodiment described, a flame analysis rate of 1 second has been found to be suitable because it corresponds to the thermal time constants of the paving machine <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the processing unit <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> acquires a sample (block <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>), and determines whether the burner assembly <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is in the process of igniting the air/fuel mixture (block <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>). The processing unit <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> does not utilize samples acquired during the ignition process because a large amount of noise is created during ignition of the air/fuel mixture. If the burner assembly <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is in the process of igniting the air-fuel mixture, then the processing unit <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> exits the sampling subroutine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> If the burner assembly <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is not in the process of igniting the system, then the software proceeds to analyze the sample. Specifically, the software <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> determines whether the sampled value is greater than a filtered value (block <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>). If the sampled value is greater than the filter value, then the software determines that the conditioned signal is increasing and proceeds to block <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight>. Otherwise, the software proceeds to block <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> At block <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight>, the software determines whether a trend_increasing_flag variable or object is set to true. The trend_increasing_flag variable informs the software whether the conditioned signal was previously determined to have an increasing trend. If the trend_increasing_flag variable is false (i.e., the trend of the conditioned signal was previously decreasing), then the software sets the trend_increasing_flag variable to true, sets a trend_decreasing_flag variable to false, and resets a trend_increasing_counter variable (block <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight>). The trend_increasing_counter variable is a counter that counts the number of increasing trend increments that have occurred without interruption (i.e., without a decrement). The software then increments the trend_increasing_counter variable, increases the filter value by an amount (block <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>), and exits the sampling subroutine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> At block <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight>, the software determines whether the sampled value is less than the filter value. If the sampled value is less than the filter value, then the software determines that the conditioned signal is decreasing and proceeds to block <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight>. Otherwise, the software determines the conditioned signal is unchanged and exits the sampling subroutine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> At block <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight>, the software determines whether a trend_decreasing_flag variable is true. The trend_decreasing_flag variable informs the software whether the conditioned signal was previously determined to have a decreasing trend. If the trend_decreasing_flag variable is set to false (i.e., the trend of the conditioned signal was previously increasing), then the software sets the trend_decreasing_flag variable to true, sets the trend_increasing_flag variable to false, and resets a trend_decreasing_counter variable (act <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight>). The trend_decreasing_counter variable is a counter that counts the number of decreasing trend increments that have occurred without interruption (i.e., without a decrement). The software then increments a trend_decreasing_counter variable, decreases the filter value by an amount (block <highlight><bold>545</bold></highlight>), and exits the sampling subroutine. Of course, in other embodiments, only one trend counter may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The software continuously performs the sampling routine while the fuel valve <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is open. In addition to performing the sampling routine, the software analyzes the flags and counters to determine whether the air-fuel mixture is lit. For one embodiment and as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the software compares the current filter value with a previous_filter_value variable (block <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>) to determine if the difference is greater than a threshold (block <highlight><bold>555</bold></highlight>). If the difference between the two values is greater than a threshold, then a no_flame_flag variable is set to true (block <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight>). Otherwise, the no_flame_flag variable is set to false (block <highlight><bold>565</bold></highlight>). For the embodiment shown, a decreasing thermocouple voltage signifies an increasing temperature, and an increasing thermocouple voltage signifies a decreasing temperature. If the difference is smaller than a threshold, the software determines that the air-fuel mixture is lit (i.e., the flame is on). If it is larger than the threshold, then the software determines that the air-fuel mixture is not lit (i.e., the flame is extinguished). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In addition to determining whether the difference between the current and previous filter values is greater than a threshold, the software analyzes the trend of the sampled values to determine whether the air/fuel mixture is not lit. Specifically, if the trend_increasing_flag variable is true (block <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight>), then the software determines whether the trend_increasing_counter variable is greater than a first value signifying a significant increasing trend (block <highlight><bold>575</bold></highlight>). If the trend_increasing_counter variable is greater than a first value, then the software sets no_flame_flag variable to true (block <highlight><bold>580</bold></highlight>). If the trend_decreasing_flag variable is true (block <highlight><bold>585</bold></highlight>), then the software determines whether the trend_decreasing_counter variable is greater than a second value signifying a significant decreasing trend (block <highlight><bold>590</bold></highlight>). If the trend_decreasing_counter variable is greater than a second value, the software sets no_flame_flag variable to true (block <highlight><bold>595</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> At block <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>, the software analyzes no_flame_flag variable. If no_flame_flag variable is true, then the software generates an output (block <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight>) signifying the air-fuel mixture is not lit. The output may be used to close the fuel valve <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, and/or to provide an alarm to the operator with the one or more output devices <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight>. Otherwise, the software sets previous_filter_value to the current filter value (block <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>), and returns from the analysis subroutine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> As can be seen from the above, the invention provides, among other things, a new and useful burner assembly <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> for heating a screed plate <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> connected to a frame <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> of a paving machine <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>.
