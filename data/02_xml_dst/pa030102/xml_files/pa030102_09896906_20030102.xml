<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A system for control of water delivery to an interior of a tub, spa or shower includes a plurality of ports and a flow control device. The plurality of ports is adapted to be located on a surface of the tub, spa, or shower and the plurality of ports is configured to transmit water to an interior of the tub, spa, or shower. A first pipe of the flow control device includes a plurality of elongated inlets and a second pipe includes a plurality of outlets in fluid communication with the plurality of ports. The first pipe or the second pipe is moveable, one relative to the other.

<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates, generally, to water flow into tubs, spas or showers and, more particularly, to control of water delivery through ports in tubs, spas or showers. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Tubs, spas or showers generally have a number of fluid flow ports or nozzles. Each flow port usually transmits or jets water or a water-air froth into the tub, spa or shower. Enhanced treatment or enjoyment for a user typically results from increased control over the flow of fluid to the tub, spa or shower. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> One design employs a multi-ported valve having a handle to allow a user to rotate an inner cylindrical member relative to an outer cylindrical casing for selective alignment of ports of the inner cylindrical member and ports of the outer cylindrical member, for selective flow among a water supply and recirculating system, a spa, and a swimming pool. For instance, the user can manually rotate the handle to align a first port for flow of water to the spa and a second port for flow of water from the spa, and then the user can further manually rotate the handle to stop the flow of water to move from the spa and instead align the first port for flow of water to the swimming pool and align the second port for flow of water from the swimming pool. These first and second ports are the only ports for water flow between the valve and the spa for between the valve and the swimming pool. For example, the manual rotation of the handle by the user does not allow selection among individual ones, sets, or subsets of ports for water flow into the spa. Such a design is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,874,413 issued to Valdez. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Another configuration includes an air valve for spas and baths. Air is drawn from the air valve to a jet by a venturi effect created by coupling of a water pump to the jet. A knob is manipulated by a user to selectively cause full, partial, or no air flow from the air valve to the jet. The air valve includes a housing having a port and a slot, and a barrel having a port. A user can turn the knob connected with the barrel, to cause selective flow or blockage of air, by selectively aligning the port of the barrel with the slot or port of the housing, or by selectively blocking the port of the barrel by aligning neither the slot nor port of the housing with the port of the barrel. In this configuration, only one jet delivers water from the pump to the spa or bath. The manual turning of the knob by the user does not allow selection among individual ones, sets, or subsets of ports for water flow into the spa or bath. The manipulation of the knob simply selects the quantity of air content in the flow through the jet. Such a configuration is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,918,768 issued to DeSousa et al. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of such systems results from the pressurized water and air utilized to provide a therapeutic effect to a user. The pressurized water and/or air may result in &ldquo;hammering&rdquo; or pressure buildup in such devices which may result in damage thereto. One method of preventing damage due to such pressure buildup is to provide for a pressure relief valve which may allow water and/or air to escape from such a system when pressure in the system rises above an acceptable level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Thus, a need exists for increasing selectability and/or controllability of water delivery to a tub, spa or shower while reducing the likelihood that pressure build-up will cause damage to such a system. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In one aspect of the invention, a system for user control, of water delivery to an interior of a tub, spa or shower includes a plurality of ports and a flow control device. The plurality of ports are adapted to be located on a surface of the tub, spa or shower, and are configured to transmit water to the interior of the tub, spa, or shower. The flow control device is adapted for fluid communication with a water source and includes a first pipe and a second pipe. The first pipe includes a plurality of elongated inlets and the second pipe includes a plurality of outlets in fluid communication with the plurality of ports. The first pipe or the second pipe is movable, one relative to the other. Moving of the first pipe or the second pipe to a first position of the plurality of positions serves to cause communication of an elongated inlet of the plurality of elongated inlets with a first outlet of the plurality of outlets. The first outlet is adapted for fluid communication with a first port of the plurality of ports. The communication of the elongated inlet with the first outlet serves to allow flow of water from the water source, when in fluid communication with the flow control device, to the elongated inlet to the first outlet to the first port to the interior of the tub, spa or shower. The moving of the first pipe or the second pipe to the position also serves to block a second outlet of the plurality of outlets with a solid portion of the first pipe. The second outlet is adapted for fluid communication with a second port of the plurality of ports. The blocking of the second outlet with the solid portion serves to prevent flow of water from the water source, when in fluid communication with the flow control device, to the second port to the interior of the tub, spa or shower. Moving of the first pipe or the second pipe to a second position of the plurality positions serves to cause the first elongated inlet to remain in fluid communication with the first outlet and the first outlet to remain in fluid communication with the first port. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In a second aspect of the invention, a system for control of water delivery to an interior of a tub, spa or shower includes a plurality of ports and a flow control device. The plurality of ports are adapted to be located on a surface of the tub, spa or shower and are configured to transmit water to the interior of the tub, spa or shower. The flow control device is adapted for fluid communication with a water source and includes a first pipe and a second pipe. The first pipe includes a plurality of elongated inlets and the second pipe includes a plurality of outlets in fluid communication with the plurality of ports. The first pipe or the second pipe is moveable, one relative to the other. At least one elongated inlet of the plurality of elongated inlets remains in fluid communication with at least one outlet of the plurality of outlets throughout the plurality of positions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In a third aspect of the invention, a system for control of water delivery to an interior of a tub, spa, or shower includes the plurality of ports and a flow control device. The plurality of ports is adapted to be located on a surface of the tub, spa, or shower and is configured to transmit water to the interior of the tub, spa, or shower. The flow control device is adapted for a flow communication with a water source and includes a pipe having a plurality of elongated inlets. The pipe is movable among a plurality of positions and at least one elongated inlet of the plurality of elongated inlets is in fluid communication with at least one port of the plurality of ports through the plurality of positions.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the principles of the present invention, a user may control a flow control device to select and/or control water delivery through particular ones, sets, or subsets of ports in a tub, spa or shower. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may include one or more instances of flow control device <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> located on or beneath surface <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of tub <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), spa <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>), or shower <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). The tub, spa or shower may include interior <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The interior may receive, hold, circulate and/or drain water and/or water-air froth. The surface may include curves, contours and/or planes. For example, the surface may be configured to provide comfortable, therapeutic and/or enjoyable seating, standing, reclining, positioning and/or fluid flow for one or more users <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) who may be located in the interior of the tub, spa or shower, as described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Referring further to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may include a plurality of ports <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. The ports may be located on surface <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of the tub, spa or shower. In addition, the ports may be configured to transmit water to interior <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. In one example, one or more of the ports may comprise a nozzle. The ports may be in fluid communication with a plurality of connectors <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). The connectors may provide fluid communication between the ports and a plurality of outlets <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of flow control device <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. For instance, the connectors may comprise a number of tubes attached and/or fastened to the outlets and the ports. Water may be transmitted by the connectors from the outlets to the ports. In one example, a conductor <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) may transmit water to the flow control device, for transmission from the outlets through the connectors to the ports. The conductor may receive water from water source <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). For instance, the conductor may comprise a tube coupled with the water source. The water source may comprise a water pump attached and/or fastened to the conductor for transmitting pressurized water therethrough. In addition, the outlets may be configured to ease and/or facilitate fastening, coupling, unfastening, decoupling, re-fastening and/or re-coupling thereof with the conductors. For instance, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, sets of the outlets may be directed in generally orthogonal directions (e.g., generally away from the interior of the tub) when the flow control device is located at a comer of the tub, and sets of the outlets may be directed in generally opposite directions (e.g., generally in parallel with a local surface) when the flow control device is located between corners of the tub. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Again referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, flow control device <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may include a controller <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> for controlling a motor <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> which may move a first pipe relative to a second pipe or alternatively may move the second pipe relative to the first pipe. Controller <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> or a display for controller <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> may be located on surface <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, while motor <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> may be located on or beneath surface <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Programming controller <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> to control motor <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> may allow selection among ports <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> for water delivery to interior <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of the tub, spa or shower. In addition, one or more knobs <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> may be located on surface <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of the tub, spa or shower. For example, the user may manually turn the one or more knobs to adjust the temperature of the water delivered through the flow control device to the ports and the interior of the tub, spa or shower. For instance, an exit <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> may be located on the surface of the tub, spa or shower. The exit may allow water to be removed, drained, and/or expelled from the interior of the tub, spa or shower. The selection of the ports for conduction of the water may be controlled by the user programming controller <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> to control motor <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> of flow control device <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, as described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Referring further to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, ports <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> may be cooperatively and/or strategically arranged on surface <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of the tub, spa or shower. The ports may have water conducted (e.g., distributed) therethrough as individual ones and/or in groups, sets, or subsets. In one example, a particular port <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> may be in fluid communication with a certain outlet <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> on a one-to-one basis. In another example, a particular port <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> may be in fluid communication with multiple outlets <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> on a one-to-many basis. In yet another example, multiple ports <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> may be in fluid communication with a certain outlet <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> on a many-to-one basis. In a further example, multiple ports <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> may be in fluid communication with multiple outlets <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> on a many-to-many basis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Again referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, ports <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> may be located, for instance, on different parts of surface <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> about an intended location for user <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). For instance, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, pairs of ports <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> may be located approximately about the chest, the lower back, and the ankles of user <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> intended to be located (e.g., seated) approximately at exemplary location <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> on the surface of spa <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. As another example, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, pairs of ports <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> may be located approximately about the neck, the hips, and the feet of user <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> intended to be located (e.g., reclined) approximately at exemplary location <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> on the surface of tub <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. For example, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, pairs of ports <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> may be located approximately about the head, the waist, and the calves of user <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> intended to be located (e.g., standing) approximately at exemplary location <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> on the surface of shower <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. With such a configuration, a single user by programming controller <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> can select whether the flow from one or more flow control devices will flow from the sets of nozzles about the head, or about the waist, or about the lower legs, or about all these locations. Thus, by programming the controller, the user selectively controls the flow to different parts of his or her body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> For explanatory purposes, an illustrative description of exemplary water flow through ports <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> to interior <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> as selected by programming of controller <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> of flow control device <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> by user <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, is presented with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the user at location <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> may program the controller to control the motor to turn the first pipe or the second pipe to a first position which causes flow of water from the ports to both hips of the user. The user may program the controller to control the motor to turn the first pipe or the second pipe to a second position which causes flow of water to both feet and both hips of the user. Through the use of addition flow control devices, water flow might be selectively provided to other parts of the body, for example, the neck of the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Programming of the controller may also allow the preselection of flow patterns among the positions of the first or the second pipe described above. For example, the controller might be programmed to cause water flow to alternate at specified intervals of time between the first and second positions described above causing water flow to alternate between a user&apos;s feet and hips. Alternatively, through the use of a second flow control device, the controller might be programmed to cause water flow at specified intervals of time between one side of a user&apos;s neck and one foot or it may be programed to allow flow to alternate between one foot, one hip, and one side of a neck. Thus, the controller might allow a user to take advantage of all or some of the ports at timing preferable to him through programming the controller to move the first or second pipe of a plurality of flow control devices among a plurality of positions. The number of flow patterns can be varied by either changing the position of the first or the second pipe, or the time or cycle which the first pipe rotates relative to the second pipe of each flow control device. Thus, by varying the cycle time, the number of flow patterns is virtually unlimited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the user at location <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> may program the controller to control the motor of the first flow control device to turn the first pipe or the second pipe to a first position which causes flow of water from the ports to both Achilles tendons of the user. The user may program the controller to control the motor to turn the first pipe or the second pipe to a second position which causes flow of water from the ports to both shoulders of the user. The user may program the controller to control the motor to turn the first pipe or the second pipe to a third position which causes flow of water from the ports to both shoulders and both Achilles tendons. As will be evident to those skilled in the art, further flow control devices may be provided to control flows of water from ports to other parts of the body at selected intervals of time. For example, flow of water might be provided to the waist area of the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Programming of the controller may also allow the preselection of flow patterns among the positions of the first or the second pipes described above. For example, a user might program the controller to alternate at specified intervals of time between the first and second positions described above causing water flow to alternate between a user&apos;s Achilles tendons and shoulders (e.g. ports <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>). Also, through the use of a second flow control device <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 5</cross-reference>), the controller might be programmed to alternate at specified intervals of time between various other positions of first flow control device <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> second flow control device <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> to cause water flow to a user&apos;s waist, Achilles tendons, and shoulders (e.g. ports <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>). A user might also program the controller to alternate water flow between part of the waist, one Achilles tendon, and one shoulder (e.g. ports <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>). Through programming of the controller by a user, other patterns of preselection are possible by combining and isolating particular ports through the selection of various positions of several flow control devices at specified intervals of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the user at location <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> may program the controller to control the motor of first flow control device <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to turn the first pipe or the second pipe to a first position which causes flow of water from the ports to both shins and calves of the user. The user may program the controller to control the motor to turn the first pipe or the second pipe to a second position which causes flow of water from the ports to multiple sides of the lower back and abdomen of the user. The user may program the controller to control the motor to turn the first pipe or the second pipe to a third position which causes flow of water to the parts of both the first and second positions. The user may program the controller to control the motor of second flow control device <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> to cause water flow to other areas of the body, for example, the shins, calves, face, forehead, ears, hair, neck, and shoulders of the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Programming of the controller may also allow the preselection of flow patterns among the positions of first flow control device <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> described. For example, the controller might be programmed to cause water flow to alternate at specified intervals of time between the first and second positions described above causing water flow to alternate between a user&apos;s shins and calves and multiple sides of the user&apos;s lower back and abdomen. The user might program the controller to alternate between the first, second, and third positions of the first or second pipe causing water flow to alternate between a user&apos;s shins and calves and multiple sides of the user&apos;s lower back and abdomen and water flow to all of these locations simultaneously. Alternatively, the controller might be programmed to control the motor of first flow control device <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and a motor of second flow control device <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> to cause water flow at specified intervals of time, for example, between one of a user&apos;s shins/calves, one side of the lower back/abdomen, and one side of the face and shoulder. Thus, a user might program the controller to preselect other flow patterns at preferred intervals of time by combining and isolating particular ports through the movement of the first and second pipes of one or more flow control devices among a plurality of positions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Turning to FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, flow control device <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may include outer pipe <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, inner pipe <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, motor <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, and controller <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. The outer pipe may rotatably receive the inner pipe. For example, the outer pipe may comprise a hollow cylindrical sleeve having an inner diameter sized to snugly and/or slidably engage a slightly smaller outer diameter of another hollow cylindrical sleeve comprising the inner pipe. The inner pipe may be connected with the motor. In addition, the inner pipe may include a plurality of elongated inlets <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>. The inner pipe may be configured for selective pivoting through movement by the motor to control alignment of elongated inlets <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> with outlets <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of the outer pipe. For example, the user, by programing the controller to control the motor to turn the outer pipe <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> or the inner pipe <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, may selectively align individual ones, sets, or subsets of the elongated inlets with the outlets. Further, the movement of the outer pipe <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> or the inner pipe <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> by the motor may serve to selectively block individual ones, sets, or subsets of the outlets with one or more solid portions <highlight><bold>425</bold></highlight> of the inner pipe. Exemplary description of selective alignment of the inlets and solid portions with outlets by movement of the outer pipe <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> or the inner pipe <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, is presented herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6</cross-reference>, inlets <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> and outlets <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be sized for cooperative communication of water therethrough. In one example, the inlets and the outlets may be comparable in size. In another example, a number of the inlets may be elongated or larger than the outlets, and oriented to circumferentially overlap one another and thus span more than one circumferential portion of inner pipe <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. This allows an inlet to remain in fluid communication with an outlet and an outlet to remain in fluid communication with a port when inner pipe <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> is moved from one position to another position relative to the outlets of outer pipe <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. By allowing at least one inlet, outlet and port to remain in fluid communication, a build up of pressure or &ldquo;hammering&rdquo; can be reduced or eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Sudden increases in water and/or air pressure may occur when the position of inner pipe <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> is moved relative to outer pipe <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. The pressure changes result from inlets and outlets alternating among fluid communication with and non-communication with each other and with the ports, as is known by those skilled in the art. Any excess water/air pressure generated as a result of a change in the position of inner pipe <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> may be relieved to the interior of the spa through the fluid communication of the inlet(s), outlet(s), and port(s) which remain in fluid communication with one another through more than one position of inner pipe <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> due to the elongated nature of the inlets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> For example, a first position of an inner pipe relative to an outer pipe might cause fluid communication between two elongated inlets, two outlets, and two ports, and a second position might cause fluid communication between only one elongated inlet, one outlet, and one port. In the case of moving between the first position and the second position, any excess water, air, and/or energy of the pressure difference generated in the transition from fluid communication of two sets of elongated inlets, outlets and ports to one set thereof, might be discharged to the interior of the spa through the inlet, outlet, and port remaining in fluid communication with one another. Thus, a need for a pressure relief valve may be reduced or eliminated through the utilization of the elongated inlets which span more than one position of inner pipe <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. In further examples, the inlets and/or the outlets may comprise any number of shapes, locations, and/or patterns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, flow control device <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may be located on surface <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> by attaching or fastening a portion of the flow control device to a wall of the tub, spa or shower. In one example, the wall may comprise surface <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of the tub, spa or shower. The wall may include a first side comprising a surface <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> facing in a direction toward interior <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, and a second side (e.g., the backside of the wall) facing in an opposite direction (e.g., away from the interior). For instance, bolts, nuts, screws, glue, gaskets and/or sealant may be employed to secure the flow control device to the tub, spa or shower. For example, the motor of the flow control device may be located on or beneath the surface <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to allow pivoting of the outer pipe <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> or the inner pipe <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> by the motor through the programming of the controller by user <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> with the user located in the interior of the tub, spa or shower. Controller <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> or a display for controller <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, may be located on the surface <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6</cross-reference>, neck <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> of flow control device <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may be employed to support motor <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. The neck may extend through an aperture in a wall of the tub, spa or shower. The neck may be supported with outer pipe <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, for example, located behind the wall. In addition, the neck may be connected with cap <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> of the flow control device. For instance, the neck and the cap may be connected by mating screw threads. Further, the cap may include an opening through which may extend shaft <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> of the motor. The shaft <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> of the motor may receive head <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> of interconnector <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> of the flow control device. For example, the shaft <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> may include a recess or slot for receiving the head of the interconnector. The recess and the head may be sized and/or shaped cooperatively. For instance, the recess may include surfaces for static engagement with the head. The interconnector may be supported and/or connected with inner pipe <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. Turning of the shaft by the motor controlled by the controller programmed by user <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> may advantageously transmit force applied by the shaft to the interconnector to effect pivoting of the inner pipe. For instance, the shaft may cause directly corresponding pivoting of the inner pipe. Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the shaft may be pivoted 360 degrees to effect selective full and/or partial alignments and/or non-alignments of inlets <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> of the inner pipe with outlets <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of outer pipe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In another example, controller <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> or a display for controller <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> may have markings and/or indications for a number of occurrences of the full and/or partial alignments and/or non-alignments between the inlets and the outlets. Further illustrative description of turning of the shaft to effect pivoting of the inner pipe, is presented herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, flow control device <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may include relief valve <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight>. The relief valve may be in communication with inner pipe <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. For example, the relief valve may provide relief of excess water pressure in the flow control device. For instance, the relief valve may be configured to provide pressure relief approximately at a particular level of fluid pressure. Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the relief valve may be in fluid communication with a port <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> located on surface <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of the tub, spa or shower. A conduit <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) may provide communication between the relief valve and the port. In one example, water source <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) may comprise a pump providing a pressure head of approximately 26 p.s.i., and the relief valve may be triggered at approximately 14 p.s.i. For example, user <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> may program the controller <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> to select all outlets <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for water flow to interior <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of the tub, spa or shower, and then the user may program the controller <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> to select some of the outlets for water flow to the interior of the tub, spa or shower. The difference in water pressure resulting from transmission through all the outlets versus some of the outlets may be accommodated by the pressure relief valve. For instance, the excess water and/or energy of the pressure difference may be relieved and/or employed by transmission of the excess water through the relief valve to one or more ports <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> in the tub, spa or shower. Also, if more than one flow control device are connected together either in series or in parallel flow relationship, the use of a relief valve on each flow control device will ensure that no excess pressure is exerted within any of the flow control devices. Such excess pressure could conceivably occur when less than a certain number of flow control devices are in the &ldquo;off&rdquo; position. &lsqb;WOULD A PRESSURE RELIEF VALVE EVER BE USED WITH THIS DESIGN&quest;&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Again referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6</cross-reference>, a number of portions of flow control device <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may comprise a material such as plastic and/or ABS plastic. For instance, such a material may be formed by a technique such as molding and/or injection molding. In one example, a seal and/or fluid-tight seal may be provided between portions of flow control device <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. For instance, such a seal may comprise glue and/or gasketing material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> For illustrative purposes, detailed examples are presented herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, flow control device <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may include a number of outlets or sets of outlets <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> arranged in one or more circumferential portions <highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight> of outer pipe <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. The outlets or sets of outlets may be cooperatively and/or strategically arranged. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6</cross-reference>, a set of outlets <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> located in first circumferential portion <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> of outer pipe <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> may comprise two outlets. The set of outlets may comprise a proximal outlet <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> and a distal outlet <highlight><bold>434</bold></highlight>. In another example, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26, a</cross-reference> first and second set of outlets may be generally directed in orthogonal directions. In yet another example, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27, a</cross-reference> third set of outlets may be located in a third circumferential portion <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight> of the outer pipe.

<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> From the present description, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that as an alternative to the use of motor <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and controller <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, a handle <highlight><bold>3010</bold></highlight> may be connected to a first pipe or a second pipe of a flow control device to allow the user to move the first pipe or the second pipe among the plurality of positions described above, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> In one example, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 25</cross-reference>, a connector <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> in fluid communication with a port <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> may be in fluid communication with air supply conduit <highlight><bold>1602</bold></highlight>. For instance, the air supply conduit may be in fluid communication with the atmosphere. In one example, flow of pressurized water through the connector may serve to draw air from the air supply conduit for transmission of air with the water through the port to interior <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of the tub, spa or shower. The port may resemble a venturi. For example, the port may have a throat which is constricted along the direction of flow, to cause an increase in velocity of the water flowing in the connector to effect a decrease in pressure that may draw air from the air supply conduit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> While parts of the description herein, for explanatory purposes, may imply certain exemplary directions, such directions may be considered relative. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the significance of, for example, a &ldquo;vertically upward&rdquo; direction in many environments may stem from its opposition to a dominant &ldquo;downwardly&rdquo; acting gravitational force, resulting from the presence of a large mass such as the Earth, with &ldquo;vertical&rdquo; approximating radial alignment therewith. Furthermore, a &ldquo;horizontal&rdquo; direction and a &ldquo;vertically upward&rdquo; direction may be readily ascertained following determination of an appropriate &ldquo;downward&rdquo; direction. A number of design choices may allow accommodations of any orientations for any systems, ports, tubs, spas, showers, flow control devices, and/or portions thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> A force application and/or fluid flow may serve to cause advantageous effect(s). In one aspect, such force application and/or fluid flow may cooperate with other force application(s) and/or fluid flow(s) to achieve desired outcome(s). That is, a certain cause may be a contributor to desired result(s), occupying any of a number of positions within hierarchical arrangement(s) of causation(s) for outcome(s), benefit(s), advantage(s), and/or the like. </paragraph>
