<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to optical fiber communications, and particularly to a method and apparatus for preparing an optical fiber for fusion to another optical fiber, optical waveguide or optical device; for preparing an optical fiber for polishing or for forming a lens; and for preparing an optical fiber for optical or geometrical measurements. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Optical fibers generally comprise an inner glass layer circumferentially surrounded by an outer glass layer. The inner glass layer has an index of refraction that is greater than the index of refraction of the outer glass layer to provide waveguide capability. The inner layer of the optical fiber waveguide is conventionally referred to as the core, and the outer layer of the optical fiber waveguide is conventionally referred to as the cladding. The optical fibers generally have a very small diameter, and are susceptible to external influences such as mechanical stress and environmental conditions. These environmental conditions can adversely impact the optical fiber. To protect the fiber from these environmental conditions, one or more layers of protective material circumferentially surround the optical fiber. By convention, these protective outer layers are referred to as the buffer layer, coatings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Certain uses of optical fibers require that a portion of the buffer layer be removed from an end of the fiber or a portion of the fiber that is remote from the ends of the fiber. For example, to make an optical fiber coupler, the buffer is stripped from the end portion of at least one optical fiber and a portion remote from the end of another fiber, and the stripped portions of the optical fiber are fused together in a side-by-side relationship. Alternatively, the optical fiber may be fused together in a butt-coupled relationship. In this relationship, the endfaces of the fiber are coupled together and fused. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The buffer layer may be manually stripped from an optical fiber by placing the fiber within an hand-held tool, bringing blades of the tool into contact with opposite sides of the coating layer, and then moving the tool relative to the axis (the optic axis) of the coated optical fiber. The bare portion of the optical fiber must then be cleaned. This may be achieved by a variety of techniques, such as wiping the fiber manually with a cloth wetted with alcohol or suitable solvent to remove particles of the buffer layer that have deposited on the bare portion of the optical fiber in the buffer stripping process. The cleaning process also removes any other contaminants from the surface of the optical fiber. The cleaning process may also be effected using types of equipment that eliminate the need for manually cleaning. These equipment are useful because manually physical contact is avoided. In addition to safety issues, the cleaning process is generally faster, cleaner, and avoids any defects in the fiber due to manual handling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The next step in the process for preparing an optical fiber for fusion is a cleaving process. The cleaving process is designed to provide a substantially planar surface at a particular angle relative to the optic axis. For example, the plane of the endface of the optical fiber may be perpendicular to the optical axis of the optical fiber. This has been done traditionally in a manual step using commercially available cleaving tools. The manual sequence includes clamping the optical fiber and cleaving the fiber with the cleaving tool. This process has certain drawbacks that ultimately impact the optical characteristics of the fiber. For example, if the clamp is improperly loaded, the cleave blade may be misaligned relative to the fiber. Moreover, some optical fibers are shipped in a pigtailed fashion. Moreover, some fibers include an additional large diameter protective coating. A curl or curve in the fiber may result that may adversely affect the alignment of the fiber during cleaving. This may result in a poor cleave angle tolerance, and ultimately adversely impact the optical characteristics of the fiber in its final application. To this end, often the cleaving is effected by applying tension to the optical fiber. If the tension is too great, the optical fiber can experience stress related damage. If the tension is not great enough, the cleave blade cannot effect a good cut and an undesireable cleave angle may result. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Finally, the above described conventional methods of stripping, cleaning and cleaving of an optical fiber involve a variety of transport steps from one station to the next. With each of these steps, the operator is exposed to injury and the optical fiber is exposed to potential damage. Furthermore, cycle times may be adversely impacted by manual transportation. There is also a relatively high degree of operator involvement and effectiveness required to produce acceptable cleaved ends. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> What is needed, therefore is a method and apparatus for preparing an optical fiber which overcomes the drawbacks of conventional techniques and apparati described above. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In the following detailed description, for purposes of explanation and not limitation, exemplary embodiments disclosing specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, it will be apparent to one having ordinary skill in the art that the present invention may be practiced in other embodiments that depart from the specific details disclosed herein. In other instances, detailed descriptions of well-known devices and methods may be omitted so as not to obscure the description of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Briefly, the present invention relates to a method and apparatus for concurrently processing a plurality of optical fibers having a substantially vertical orientation, where the concurrent processing is substantially automated. For example, an illustrative method and apparatus are disclosed for preparing an optical fiber for cleaving and the cleaving thereof. According to an exemplary method of the present invention, the optical fiber is disposed in a machine. The machine moves the optical fiber to a straightener station where the optical fiber is straightened. The machine moves the optical fiber to a stripper station where the buffer layer is stripped from at least a portion of the optical fiber. The machine moves the optical fiber to a cleaning station where the optical fiber is cleaned. The machine moves the optical fiber to a cleave station where the optical fiber is cleaved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The present invention is advantageous because a variety of steps may be carried out which conventionally have been effected manually. Accordingly, the present invention fosters a reduction in handling of bare optical fiber, and as such improves safety in workplace. Moreover, the present invention fosters cleanliness of the prepared fiber end. The present invention also results in a reduction in time required to prepare a fiber for cleaving and of the cleaving thereof. Moreover, the cleave achieved in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention results in an endface having an accurate angle with respect to the optic axis; and one having substantially few aberrations or fractures resulting from the cleave. Illustratively, the cleaved optical fiber may then be fused by a variety of techniques to another optical fiber, another optical waveguide, or another optical device including an integrated optical waveguide or silicon optical bench. The better cleave results in a better fusion of the optical fiber to another optical fiber, optical waveguide or other optical device. This results ultimately in better coupling, and better optical performance by the optical fiber cleaved in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> While the preparation of the optical fiber for cleaving and the cleaving thereof is useful for fusion splicing of an optical fiber as described above, the cleaved fiber may be mechanically spliced where optical adhesives are used to provide the mechanical bond between the optical fiber, another optical fiber or other optical devices as referenced above. Moreover, the preparation for cleaving and cleaving of the optical fiber in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention may be useful in effecting power meter measurements, optical measurements (e.g. polarization mode dispersion measurements) and other measurements within the purview of one having ordinary skill in the art. Additionally, the optical fiber which has been prepared for cleaving and cleaved in accordance with the illustrative embodiments of the present invention may be useful in mechanical measurements (e.g. core-cladding concentricity measurements), optical time domain reflectometry (OTDR) connections. Furthermore, the fibers prepared for cleaving and cleaved in accordance with exemplary embodiments of the present invention may have ends used for optical switches, particularly large quantity optical fiber switches. Finally, the cleaning sequence in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention results in better contaminant removal then is conventionally achieved. Removal of contaminants ultimately results in better optical coupling in various applications of optical fibers prepared in accordance with illustrative embodiments of the present invention. These and other advantages will be readily apparent to one having ordinary skill in the art having had the benefit of the present disclosure. Still other advantages may be realized through use of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Turning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an illustrative method of cleaving an optical fiber is shown via a flow chart. Illustratively, the method of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> may be implemented using fiber preparation machines such as those described hereinbelow. Alternatively, the illustrative method described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> may be implemented using other fiber preparation machines. At <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, the optical fiber is disposed in the machine. The optical fiber illustratively has a random length. Next, at <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the machine moves the optical fiber to a straightening station, where the optical fiber is straightened. The straightening of the optical fiber is effected to remove curling of the optical fiber by coating set. This curling may be severe, and is usefully eliminated to allow the fiber to be cut at a prescribed and constant length. This facilitates the described preparation sequence, and ultimately assures improved optical coupling in various applications of the optical fiber such as fusion splicing to another optical fiber, optical waveguide or optical device. It is noted that the optical fiber may be cut to a predetermined length at the straightening station. The cutting of the optical fiber to a particular length has advantages described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown at <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, the machine moves the optical fiber to a stripper station, where the buffer (or coating) is stripped. Because the optical fiber has been straightened in the straightening sequence as described in <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the removal of the buffer to a predetermined and substantially constant length can be readily achieved. Next, as shown at <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, the machine moves the fiber to a cleaning station, where the optical fiber is cleaned. This cleaning step removes any debris and/or contaminants which may have remained after the stripping or which may have been disposed on the fiber during the prior processing sequences described above. The removal of these debris and/or contaminants is beneficial to assuring proper coupling when the optical fiber is fused to another optical fiber, optical waveguide or optical device. Next, as shown at <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, the machine moves the optical fiber to a cleaving station, where the fiber is cleaved at a precise endface angle (e.g. the endface angle is perpendicular to the optic axis). Illustratively, the optical fiber is tensioned accurately, to avoid the occurrence of too great or too little tension on the optical fiber. This assures a good clean cleave of the fiber, resulting in a substantially defect-free endface. Finally, it is of interest to note that the above sequence may include a carbon pre-burn, which may be carried out after stripping of the buffer layer(s). The carbon pre-burn tends to increase electrode life and decrease variability associated with the splicing of erbium fibers, commonly used as a gain medium in a variety of optical applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a perspective view of a fiber preparation machine <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in accordance with an illustrative embodiment of the present invention. The fiber preparation machine <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> includes a fiber holder transport <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. The fiber holder transport <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> has pockets <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> which receive optical fiber holders <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> having optical fibers <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> disposed therein. It is noted that the optical fibers are oriented substantially vertically. The vertical orientation is advantageous at various stations of the fiber preparation machine (and processing thereby) according to illustrative embodiments of the present invention. Further details will be described below. The fiber holder transport <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is illustratively a cylindrical element such as a rotary drum, which rotates about a shaft <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> that may be actuated by a servo motor. Alternatively, the shaft <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> may be actuated by a pneumatic acutator, a rotational piezoelectric device, or a gear driven mechanism. The servo motor or other device may be controlled by a microcomputer or suitable controller (not shown). Of course, software would be implemented to support the fiber preparation sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The fiber preparation machine <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> includes a fiber straightening station (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) that substantially straightens the fibers; a fiber stripping station <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> that removes a portion of the buffer; a cleaning station (not readily visible in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>); and a cleaving station <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In the illustrative embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the fiber preparation machine <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> has the ability to sequentially process six optical fibers <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. Of course, this is merely illustrative, and other number of optical fibers may be processed sequentially, resulting ultimately in a cleaved optical fiber in accordance with an illustrative embodiment of the present invention. Moreover, in the illustrative embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the fiber holder transport <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> rotationally transfers each optical fiber using the substantially cylindrical fiber holder transport <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. This is also merely illustrative, and the fiber holder transport <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> can be an element of a variety of other shapes adapted to rotationally transfer the optical fibers <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> from one station of fiber preparation machine <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to the next. It is further noted that rotational motion of the optical fibers from one station to another is also merely illustrative, and the optical fibers may be transferred from one station to the next by other types of motion. For example, the optical fibers may be moved linearly from one station to the next. The fibers may also be moved linearly to a first station, effect a turn of predetermined angle, and move linearly to a next station. Some examples of alternative fiber holder transports and motion of optical fibers thereby are described below. Still other fiber holder transports and motion of fibers thereby are possible, as will be apparent to one having ordinary skill in the art having had the benefit of the present disclosure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Turning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> top view of an illustrative fiber preparation machine is shown in top view. The fiber holder transport <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is shown to rotate in a clock-wise direction <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. Each fiber will sequence via the rotation to its next station where a respective process is carried out. The particular details of each process sequence and the various details of the elements thereof will be described in further detail herein. Presently, an overview of an exemplary processing sequence is described. The optical fiber, having a substantially vertical orientation, is disposed in a fiber holder <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. The fiber holder <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is disposed in the pocket <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> at a loading station <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. The fiber holder transport <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> rotates in a clock-wise direction <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> to the first station, illustratively a fiber straightening station <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. At the fiber straightening station <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, the fiber is straightened and processed as described in further herein. Upon completion at the fiber straightening station <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, the fiber holder transport <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> rotates to the next station, illustratively stripping station <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. At the stripping station <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, a predetermine length of buffer layer is removed. After completion at the stripping station <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, the fiber holder transport <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> rotates the optical fiber to the next station, illustratively cleaning station <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>. At the cleaning station <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>, debris and contaminants are removed from the fiber. After completion at the cleaning station <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>, the fiber holder transport <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> rotates to the next station, illustratively the cleaving station <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>. The optical fiber is then tensioned by a predetermined amount, and the fiber is cleaved. This completes the illustrative preparation sequence. The optical fiber then rotates in the sequence to a final position <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> where the fiber in the fiber holder <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> It is noted that the fiber preparation sequence and apparatus described is merely an illustrative embodiment of the present invention. Clearly, additional fiber processing stations, which perform the same or different functions, could be added to the sequence. Moreover, if desired, fewer fiber preparation stations could be included. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, the illustrative fiber preparation machine <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and process enable the optical fibers to be cleaved in an efficient process, with each station performing its respective function sequentially on a member of fibers. By virtue of the present invention, the fibers are substantially straight, cut to a predetermined length, and have endfaces which are substantially defect and contaminant free. Moreover, the endfaces form an angle with the optic axis which is accurate. Further details of the above referenced advantages are described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Another advantage of the fiber preparation machine <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in accordance with the illustrative embodiment is the ability to process a plurality of fibers concurrently in a substantially automated manner. An example of the simultaneous processing is described presently. Two optical fibers <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> in fiber holders <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> are disposed in pockets <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> at loading stations <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. The fiber holder transport <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> rotates clockwise bringing the first fiber to the straightening station <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. The first fiber is straightened. Upon completion of the straightening step, fiber holder transport <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> rotates clockwise bringing the first fiber to the stripping station <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and the second fiber to the straightening station <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. The first fiber is stripped of its buffer in stripping station <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> concurrently with the straightening of the fiber in straightening station <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. When both steps are complete, the fiber holder transport <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> rotates clockwise again bringing the first fiber to the cleaning <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> and the second fiber to the stripping station <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. While the first fiber is cleaned, the second fiber is stripped of its buffer. Once the cleaning station <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> and the stripping station <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> have completed their cycles, the fiber holder transport <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> rotates yet again to locate the first fiber at the cleaving station <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> and the second fiber at the cleaning station <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>. While the first fiber is cleaved in the cleaving station <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>, the second fiber is cleaned. After both steps are completed, the fiber holder transport <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> rotates to bring the first fiber to unload station <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> and the second fiber to the cleaving station <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>. At this point, the first fiber may be unloaded. The second fiber is cleaved, and the processing of further fibers may continue concurrently and in a substantially automated manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> It is again noted that the number and types of fiber processing stations is merely illustrative. Accordingly, other types as well as more or fewer fiber processing stations are clearly envisioned in accordance with the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Turning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> perspective view of the fiber holder transport <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, rotational shaft <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>, and servo motor <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is shown. Optical fibers <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> are held in fiber holders <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> which are disposed in pockets <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. The illustrative servo motor <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> enables rotation of the fiber holder transport <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> in the &minus;&phgr; direction according to the cylindrical coordinate system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Illustratively, the rotation is a step rotation. This enables rotation discretely from one station to the next upon completion of a prescribed process at a particular station. An actuator (not shown) may be included to the servo motor <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> to enable motion in the &plusmn;z-direction. This would enable the optical fibers <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> to be raised and lowered into and out of various elements of the stations. However, in the illustrative embodiment the individual stations are adapted to elevate and lower to perform respective operations on the fibers <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the fiber holder transport <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> rotates in sequential steps from one station to the next; and the station raises, performs its function and lowers to its original position. The fiber holder transport <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> then rotates the fiber to the next station and another fiber to the station just lowered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> As referenced above, the motion of the fiber holder transport <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> may be actuated by servo motor <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, an actuator, or other device. In any case, the servo motor <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> (or like device) may be controlled by a microcontroller well known to one having ordinary skill in the art. Illustratively, the microcontroller for the servo motor <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> also controls the motion of all other actuators of the fiber preparation machine <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, other controller schemes could be employed, provided a coordinating controller is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> It is noted that the substantial cylindrical shape of the fiber holder transport <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is merely illustrative. To wit, other shapes may be used for the fiber holder transport. Illustratively, the chosen shape of the fiber holder transport <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> will enable rotation about an axis so that the optical fibers may move from one station to the next in the fiber preparation machine. For example, a variety of polygons may be used, as would be readily apparent to one having ordinary skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Turning to FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), a perspective and cross-sectional view of the fiber straightening station <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> are shown, respectively. The optical fiber has a substantially vertical orientation (z-direction in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>)). The optical fiber sequences by rotation of the optical fiber from the loading station (shown at <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) to the fiber straightening station. The fiber straightening station <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> rises in the &plus;z-direction to lower the fiber into the lead-in <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the optical fiber may be lowered by the motion of the fiber holder transport (e.g. fiber holder transport <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) in the &minus;z-direction into the lead-in. Another alternative is that fiber enters the fiber straightening <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> via the rotational lead-in <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight> as fiber holder transport <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> rotates clockwise. A fiber holder sensor <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> detects the presence of a fiber holder (e.g. fiber holder <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). This serves as input to the controller. This allows for efficient operation of the fiber preparation machine as empty pockets (e.g. pocket <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) need not be processed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Cartridge heaters <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> are useful in heating the optical fiber. To this end, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), the cartridge heaters <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> act in cooperation with process gas cross channels <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> to introduce heated, moving gas into a heating chamber <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>. The cartridge heaters <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> warm heater block <highlight><bold>509</bold></highlight>. Heater block <highlight><bold>509</bold></highlight> is made of a material that enables thermal conduction to transfer heat to the gas cross-channels <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> and the gas inlet-channel <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>, where the gas is warmed by convection. When an optical fiber is lowered into the heating chamber <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> via lead-in <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight>, the heated gas flowing into heating chamber <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> warms the fiber via convection thus softening its buffer layers. It is noted that the fiber straightening station <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> as described is merely illustrative, and may include other heating mechanisms. For example, the fiber could be scanned with heating gas. The fiber could be held in a hot zone and heated by radiative heating. The fiber could also be contacted by a heated surface and conductively heated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Once the buffer layers are softened sufficiently, substantially all of the set is relieved and the fiber returns to the natural shape of the glass, which typically is very straight. The vertical orientation allows the fiber to be easily guided through the lead-ins. The cutting blades <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> usefully cut the length of the optical fiber to a prescribed length. As can be readily appreciated, this length is relatively constant for all fibers processed by the fiber preparation machine <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and eases the task of guiding the fiber between stations and within each station. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The fiber straightening station <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is particularly useful in substantially removing curl caused by setting of the buffer layer. Optical fibers are conventionally shipped in coiled form, and over time, the fibers can become curled due to the setting of the buffer layer. The fiber straightening station <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is useful in removing this curl. Moreover, the vertical orientation of the fiber can help to eliminate the distortive effects of gravity upon fiber shape in this, previous, and subsequent steps of the fiber preparation process according to illustrative embodiments of the present invention. Finally, the cut to length feature in fiber straightening station <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> also has the advantage that the scrap fiber can be collected by the machine and/or transported to a waste collection bin. Vertical orientation allows gravity to assist in waste removal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Upon completion at the fiber straightening station <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, the fiber holder transport <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> moves the fiber in the &minus;&phgr; direction (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). The fiber is rotated in this discrete rotational step to the next station, the fiber stripping station <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. The fiber stripping station <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) in a detailed perspective view described presently. The fiber stripping station <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> moves in the &plus;z-direction so the fiber (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>)) is inserted into the lead-in <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the fiber holder transport could lower the optical fiber into the lead-in <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> via motion in &minus;z-direction. As can be appreciated, gravity aids in guiding the fiber due to the vertical orientation of the fiber stripping station <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. The optical fiber passes between stripper blades <highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight> and enters a heated tube <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>. At the bottom of the heated tube is a vacuum take-away <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>. The heated tube and air within are generally heated sufficiently to soften the buffer layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The stripper blades <highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight> cut into the buffer layer of the optical fiber peripherally. Illustratively, a pneumatic cylinder <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight> lowers the heated tube <highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight> and stripper blades <highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight> in the &minus;z-direction, while the fiber <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> remains substantially fixed. Thereby, the buffer layer of the optical fiber is removed. The vacuum take-away <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> discards the removed buffer layer and substantially all other debris of this particular process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the buffer may be removed as follows upon insertion of the fiber into the heated tube <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>, hot gases assist in removing the buffer material from the optical fiber. The gases are in the form of a jet or stream and are directed onto that portion of the coating material of the buffer material that is to be removed. The gases are of a composition that substantially does not react with the material of the buffer layer. Moreover, the temperature of the gas is sufficiently high that is softens the buffer layer. Further details of the use of hot gases may be found in U.S. Pat. No. 5,948,202 to Miller The patent to Miller is specifically incorporated by reference herein in its entirety and for all purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> It is noted that the stripping station <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is illustrative, and may include other stripping mechanisms. For example, other mechanical strippers known to one of ordinary skill in the art may be used. Moreover, a hot nitrogen strip, again known in the art may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Upon removal of the buffer layer at the stripping station <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, the optical fiber is moved to the cleaning station (shown at <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). Again, this is effected through motion rotation in the &minus;&phgr; (see cylindrical coordinate system of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, for example) of the fiber holder transport. Turning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the cleaning station <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> is shown in a detailed perspective view. The cleaning station <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> includes a bath <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight>, and a fiber lead-in <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>. A pneumatic cylinder <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight> raises the bath <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> in the &plus;z-direction, thus submerging the optical fiber into the cylinder bath via the lead-in <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the fiber holder transport <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> could move the fiber <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> in the &minus;z-direction into the bath <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>. Illustratively, the bath <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> is an ultrasonic alcohol bath. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Again, the optical fiber is oriented in the vertical direction (z-direction in the Cartesian coordinate system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>) in the bath <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight>. The lead-in <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> has a substantially conical opening as shown. This facilitates insertion of the optical fiber into the cylinder bath <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight>. Because the optical fiber is oriented vertically, there is little chance the optical fiber will contact a surface of the bath <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight>, which may be adapted to vibrate. Ultimately, this substantially prevents degradation of the fiber strength, which can result if the fiber comes in contact with the vibrating surface used in the ultrasonic cleaning sequence presently described. In addition to aiding in fiber guidance at the cleaning station <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>, the vertical orientation allows passive handling of any cleaning fluid utilized. The fluid can remain in the tank between fibers. Also, solids removed from the processed fibers can sink to the bottom of the tank if the cleaning fluid has lower mass density than the contaminant particles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> It is noted that the described cleaning method of cleaning station <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> is illustrative and other cleaning methods are possible. For example, the fibers could be cleaned with pads wetted with a suitable cleaner. The pads would moves vertically over the fiber by virtue of the motion of the cleaning station <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Upon completion at the cleaning station <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>, the fiber holder indexes through rotational motion in the &minus;&phgr;-direction (reference <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) to the cleaving station <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). The optical fiber is vertically oriented (z-direction) and is disposed in upper lead-in <highlight><bold>806</bold></highlight> down through to a lower lead-in <highlight><bold>807</bold></highlight>. The upper lead-in <highlight><bold>806</bold></highlight> and lower lead-in <highlight><bold>807</bold></highlight> position the fiber accurately relative to a cleaver horn, illustratively an ultrasonic cleaver horn <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight>, for cleaving. A tensioning slide <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> applies a substantially dead-weight tension, and the ultrasonic horn <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> is positioned by a servo motor and stage <highlight><bold>808</bold></highlight>. The substantially dead-weight tension applied to the optical fiber via the tensioning slide <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> is nearly constant. To this end, the tensioning slide <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> moves on a substantially low-friction slide, and applies a nearly constant tension that is set in a particular range of force. For example, for a 250 &mgr;m diameter optical fiber, a tensile force in the range of approximately 170 g to approximately 250 g is applied by the tensioning slide <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight>. When the optical fiber is properly tensioned, the ultrasonic horn <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> cleaves the fiber by well-known techniques. Upon completion of the cleaving, fiber grippers <highlight><bold>803</bold></highlight> release the cleaved portion of the optical fiber. A vacuum take-away removes the cleaved portion of the fiber, and the fiber is removed from the upper lead-in <highlight><bold>806</bold></highlight>. The vacuum take-away is particularly advantageous from the perspective of safety as small sharp pieces of optical fiber due not need to be manually discarded by the operator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Because the tension on the optical fiber is set at a particular level and substantially maintained at this level, the problems associated of with having inconsistent tension during cleaving, as well as tension which is too great or too little tension during the cleaving process, are substantially avoided. Ultimately, this fosters the ability to cleave the optical fiber at an accurate angle relative to the endface, and to provide a clean endface with minimal aberrations and/or fractures. Moreover, the method in accordance with an illustrative embodiment of the present invention results in fiber ends with negligible amounts of hackle, negligible incidence of chips, negligible incidence of lips, and negligible incidence of spirals. The area of the endface affected by mist is small. The area of the score mark on the endface is also small. It is further noted that in the illustrative embodiment described, the speed and position of the blade are useful in assuring the accuracy and quality of the cleave. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Another illustrative embodiment of the fiber cleaving station <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> is shown in a detailed perspective view in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). In this illustrative embodiment, the optical fiber is inserted into fiber grippers <highlight><bold>803</bold></highlight> via lead-in <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight>. Again, tensioning slide <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> applies a substantially dead-weight tension to the optical fiber, which is again vertically oriented (z-direction). When the optical fiber is properly tension, the ultrasonic horn <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> cleaves the fiber. Upon completion of the cleaving, the fiber grippers <highlight><bold>803</bold></highlight> release the cleaved lower portion of the optical fiber. Next, a vacuum take-away <highlight><bold>805</bold></highlight> removes the cleaved portion of the fiber and fiber is removed from the upper lead-in <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In the illustrative stations described above, the cleaving mechanism is an ultrasonic cleaver horn. Of course, this is merely illustrative, and other cleaving mechanisms may be used to effectively cleave the optical fiber in accordance with the present invention. Generally, a flaw inducer is moved at a controlled speed and position to effectively cleave the optical fiber. The flaw inducer may be an ultrasonically agitated sharp edge, such as the ultrasonic cleaver horn described above. The flaw inducer may move via a servo motor and warm gear. Additionally, the flaw inducer may move via a rotational piezo electric motor. Furthermore, other types of flaw inducers within the purview of one having ordinary skill in the art may be used in this capacity as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Finally, upon completion at cleaving station <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>, the fiber holder transport <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> rotates in the &minus;&phgr; direction (reference <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>) to its final position <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, where the optical fiber holder <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is removed from the fiber holder transport <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. The optical fiber may then be further processed. The further processing may include fusion of the optical fiber to another optical fiber, an optical wavguide, or an optical device; or another process referenced above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The above described method is merely an illustrative method for cleaving an optical fiber in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. Of course, other methods may be implemented using a machine in accordance with an illustrative embodiment of the present invention. Two such illustrative methods are described in the below examples. These are merely illustrative of the present invention, and of course, still further techniques may be used. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> To this point, in the illustrative apparati described the entire fiber holder transport is moved (e.g. rotationally) and thereby the optical fibers are transported from one station to the next for processing. This is merely illustrative. Accordingly, other apparati may be used may be used to effect the transport of the fibers from one station to the next. In the illustrative examples that follow, various alternative fiber transport mechanisms are disclosed. Again, these are merely illustrative, and other fiber transport mechanisms may be employed. Finally, it is noted that the methods described in the illustrative embodiments above apply to the fiber transport mechanisms described herein. To wit, the fiber transport mechanisms which enable the transportation of the fiber from one station described presently to the next may all benefit from the illustrative methods and stations described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a functional block diagram of an illustrative fiber preparation machine in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The optical fibers may be loaded and unloaded at load/unload (L/U) stations <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight>. The fiber holder transport <highlight><bold>905</bold></highlight> illustratively includes a track or similar transport mechanism (not shown) in which the optical fiber holders <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> would be disposed. The optical fibers would then rotate in a clockwise manner proceeding to station <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>901</bold></highlight>), station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight>), station <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>903</bold></highlight>), station <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>) and finally to one of the load/unload stations <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> for removal and preparation. For purposes of illustration, station <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>901</bold></highlight>) is a fiber straightening station as described above; station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight>) is a fiber stripping station as described above; station <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>903</bold></highlight>) is a fiber cleaning station as described above; and station <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>) is a fiber cleaving station, also as described above. As can be readily appreciated, a noteworthy difference between the fiber preparation machine of the illustrative embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> and those described above is the fiber holder transport <highlight><bold>905</bold></highlight> does not move, but rather has elements contained therein which do. Moreover, a large number of load/unload stations <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> shows another illustrative embodiment in accordance with the present invention. Again, an optical fiber would be loaded at loading station <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>, and would proceed to station <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>1001</bold></highlight>), station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight>), station <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>1003</bold></highlight>), station <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight>), and finally to unload station <highlight><bold>1005</bold></highlight>. The fiber holder transport <highlight><bold>1006</bold></highlight> is illustratively pentagonally shaped. The fiber holder transport again includes a track <highlight><bold>1007</bold></highlight> in which the optical fibers are guided from one station to the next. Moreover, the stations described in connection with the illustrative embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> are the same as those in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. Again, a significant difference between the illustrative embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> and those described previously, lies in the stationary nature of the fiber holder transport. To this end, the fiber holder transport remains substantially stationary, but includes a mechanism therein which enables the motion of the optical fibers from one station to another. It is noted that the optical fibers may be held within modules which are transported via the track <highlight><bold>1007</bold></highlight> from one station to the next. It is further noted that the motion of the optical fibers (and modules if used) is effected by known devices. Finally, it is noted that the pentagonal shape is merely illustrative, and other polygonal may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> Turning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, another illustrative embodiment of the present invention is shown. In the present illustrative embodiment, optical fibers are loaded at load station <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> and are transported from station <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>1101</bold></highlight>), to station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>), to station <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>1103</bold></highlight>), to station <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight>), and to unload station <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>1105</bold></highlight>). The fiber holder transport <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> is substantially linear, and has tracks or other suitable devices to effect the motion of the optical fibers down the length of the fiber holder transport enabling motion from stations <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> shows another illustrative embodiment, which is similar to that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. The loading station is combined with station <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to form loading/station <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight>). Similarly, the unload station and station <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are also combined to form station <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>/unload station <highlight><bold>1204</bold></highlight>. Stations <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> remain substantially identical to their counter parts in the illustrative embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. Moreover, the fiber holder transport <highlight><bold>1205</bold></highlight> is substantially identical to that described in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> Turning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13, a</cross-reference> linear fiber preparation machine is shown. In the illustrative embodiment in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, there are two load stations <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> and two unloads stations <highlight><bold>1305</bold></highlight>. The fiber holder transport <highlight><bold>1206</bold></highlight> again includes a track or other suitable device to provide motion of the optical fibers from stations <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1301</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1304</bold></highlight>, respectively. Of course, a larger number of load stations <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> and unload stations <highlight><bold>1305</bold></highlight> that that shown may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> Turning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, yet another illustrative embodiment of the present invention is shown. The illustrative embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> is substantially identical to that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, however, as can be readily appreciated, there are identical stations <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1105</bold></highlight> on either side of the fiber holder transport <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, fibers are loaded along two tracks, or other similar devices, enabling processing of twice as many optical fibers simultaneously as is possible with the illustrative embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. Alternatively, if a station takes a longer duration to complete than another, two stations may be deployed to receive output from a single station <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>1103</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> Turning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, an illustrative embodiment is shown where only certain stations are present in multiples. For example, in the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, station <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>1504</bold></highlight>) is duplicative as is the unload station <highlight><bold>1505</bold></highlight>. The load station <highlight><bold>1500</bold></highlight>, station <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>1501</bold></highlight>), station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>1502</bold></highlight>), station <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>1503</bold></highlight>), and fiber holder transport <highlight><bold>1506</bold></highlight> are as described in the above illustrative embodiments, for example the illustrative embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. With the present illustrative embodiment, a fiber starts at load station <highlight><bold>1500</bold></highlight>, progresses through station <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>1501</bold></highlight>), station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>1502</bold></highlight>) and station <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>1503</bold></highlight>). The fiber can be processed and either of the two stations <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>1504</bold></highlight>). The fiber holder transport <highlight><bold>1506</bold></highlight> moves the fiber to the first available station <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. This is particularly a beneficial embodiment if the cycle time for station <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is long than the cycle time required to complete the processing steps at station <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and station <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Of course, this is merely illustrative, and the principle briefly described in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> can be expanded to include other and more processing stations as would readily apparent to one having ordinary skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> The invention being thus described, it would be obvious that the same may be varied in many ways by one of ordinary skill in the art having had the benefit of the present disclosure. For example, it is noted that the fiber preparation stations described above are merely illustrative. To this end, more or fewer fiber preparation stations may be incorporated into the various exemplary embodiments. Furthermore, the stations employed may perform different fiber preparation functions than those described. Such variations are not regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention, and such modifications as would be obvious to one skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of the following claims and their legal equivalents. </paragraph>
