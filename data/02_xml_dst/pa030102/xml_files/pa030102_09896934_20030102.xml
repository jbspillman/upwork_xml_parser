<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to procurement systems and methods and, in particular, to a procurement system and method that facilitates the use of sharing purchase vehicles (such as &ldquo;piggyback&rdquo; contracts in California, or such as Joint Powers agreements and Coop Agreements in terminology of various states outside of California) across multiple buying organizations. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Electronic procurement can be logically divided into three processes: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Procurement Research: Buyer identifies the product items which are most suitable for the specific purchase. Buyer identifies the product items, the supplier who will provide the product items and the price of the products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Approval: Process to authorize the purchasing of goods within the buyer&apos;s organization in order to prevent abuses from within the organization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Purchase: Process of ordering goods, order tracking and order fulfillment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, the source of product items is limited. Specifically, most conventional electronic procurement systems are limited to purchasing items listed in a &ldquo;central&rdquo; aggregated catalog (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,319,542 to King et al.). Other conventional systems allow purchasing not only from a central aggregated catalog, but also supplement the central catalog with remote access to supplier catalogs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The procurement process is complicated for some buying organizations by laws and regulations that require particular procedures be followed. For example, many educational buying organizations (e.g., school districts) are required to makes requests for proposals (RFP&apos;s) and requests for quotes (RFQ&apos;s) and also keep an audit trail to prove its due diligence. This is known generically as &ldquo;proof of best selection of product&rdquo;. Some organizations under the &ldquo;proof of best selection of product&rdquo; requirements have been able to take advantage of &ldquo;sharable&rdquo; contracts&mdash;&ldquo;piggybackable&rdquo; or &ldquo;aggregated&rdquo; contracts&mdash;where one purchaser enters into a contract, and the contract is available to be shared by other purchasers. Typical buying organizations that share contracts are school districts, state agencies, county agencies and federal government agencies. The widespread use of such &ldquo;sharable&rdquo; contracts has the potential to add much efficiency to the procurement process, while still retaining most if not all of the protections provided by &ldquo;proof of best selection of product&rdquo; requirements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Unfortunately, currently, the amount of time and work required for a buying organization to manually seek out and track such sharable contracts is significant Of course, this also unnecessarily increases the amount of time and work required on the vendor side, to respond to inquiries from multiple buying organizations. Notably, typical electronic procurement systems do not facilitate the use of such &ldquo;sharing&rdquo; contracts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Therefore, what is desired is a procurement system that facilitates the use of sharing contracts and other sharing purchase vehicles (such as shared bids and quotes). </paragraph>
</section>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the invention, a purchasing system facilitates the use of sharing purchase vehicles across multiple buyers. In a database, purchase vehicles are stored, including the sharing purchase vehicles. The database also includes matching rule information associated with the sharing purchase vehicles. In addition, the database includes audit trail information corresponding to the sharing purchase vehicle information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A subset of the stored purchase vehicles is determined based at least in part on the stored matching rule information.

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In accordance with one aspect of the invention, an integrated procurement system is provided. This embodiment is first described broadly, and is then described more particularly with reference to the figures. Focusing first on the procurement research phase, in accordance with this aspect, an integrated repository includes sources for identifying product items: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> supplier catalogs; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> sharable contracts, entered into between buying organizations and suppliers to provide goods for a pre-specified price. These contracts are loaded into the system independently or are generated by the system from winning bids of specific suppliers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> sharable quotes provided by suppliers to buyers (typically, buyers other than the researching buyer) as a result of a quote requests. (These quotes are generated by suppliers as a result of request for quotes by the procurement system or are loaded/ generated from other procurement systems); and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> sharable bids provided by suppliers to buyers as a result of bid requests. (These bids are generated by suppliers as a result of bidding requests by the procurement system or are loaded/ generated from other procurement systems) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Which sharable contracts and quotes (and other &ldquo;shared&rdquo; buying vehicles) are offered to a particular buying organization depends on &ldquo;matching rules&rdquo; provided in the integrated repository. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, by using the integrated repository, a buying organization is provided an audit trail that proves the organization has indeed done the research (e.g., RFP&apos;s and RFQ&apos;s). Applicable regulations and laws many times require an audit trail. The audit trails include not only the research done by the particular buying organization, but also provide access to audit trails of research done by other buying organizations. By providing access to the audit trails of other organizations, the buying organization can &ldquo;reuse&rdquo; the research&mdash;providing significant time and labor savings yet still complying with the applicable regulations and laws. That is, a buying organization in a community can find product items that are part of a bid or quote provided to another buying organization and rely on the audit trail associated with that bid or quote. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, when the buying organization puts a purchase out for bid or quote, the embodiment can automatically generate a contract from the bid responses. That is, when a supplier responds to a bid request, the embodiment automatically implements standard applicable procedures based on a database of business rules to select the winning response and to automatically generate a contract between the buying organization and the winning supplier organization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Some embodiments of the invention support a regional/national Integrated Repository for research by buying organizations. This Repository allows organizations, which are part of a Community to reuse the Procurement Research that has been done by other community members. One example of a community is all the state, county and government institutions. These institutions typically require extensive research for most purchases. Using the integrated repository these institutions, can thus minimize their research activities (such as quotes and bids), instead relying on research, that has been done by other institutions. It should be noted, though, that the invention in its broadest aspects is not intended to be limited to a particular type of buying organization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Reference is now made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> for a specific description of an embodiment. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a diagram of data and process flow that results from using the integrated repository. The process and data points correspond to the buyer, supplier and the integrated repository areas. Each area is divided into the following tasks: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Administration&mdash;Administrative functions used to perform work within the integrated repository. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Research&mdash;Process and data points used to support a buyer&apos;s research of items they wish to purchase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Approval&mdash;Functional area used to support the buyer&apos;s purchasing approval process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Purchase&mdash;Functional area used to support the actual purchasing of items. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Now, the process and data points are described for each of buyer, supplier and integrated repository. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Buyer </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Basically, the buyer interface is a front end to a single searchable database that provides all the key information about each item in a convenient, single page format and sorts the products into common classifications such that similar products appear together. Each of the pricing records displayed is clickable to find more product information (possibly from a separate product database) or supplier information and the audit trail of that item. In the case of a contract it will provide the relevant contract information and a further path to the contract itself; in the case of a quote, it will provide the source of the quote, the original quote request, and the responses (including losing responses); in the case of a supplier&apos;s catalog it will provide the basis for the pricing (educational discount, retail price, etc.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. The buyer is provided search or browse functionality research items from the integrated repository. Searchable/browseable data comes from any of the following: supplier catalogs, contracts, bid responses and quote responses. The buyer may search or browse the integrated repository either by specifying the source or performing a generic search/browse across all sources. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Based on the results of the search/browse process, the buyer may compare items originating from all available sources. For each item, the buyer may drill down to review the source of the item. For a contract item, the buyer can review the contract from which the item originated, the terms and conditions of the contract and the institution, which contracted with the supplier. For quote/bid response items, the buyer can review the quote/bid request and the responses of the different suppliers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. The buyer is provided the ability to submit a quote or bid to the supplier(s). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Based on the quote or bid the buyer submits, the buyer receives responses from the supplier(s). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. Upon aggregation of all appropriate items, the buyer may create a requisition. During this stage, the requisition is passed through an approval process. This process is a rules-based approval process for which each buying organization may set the workflow rules. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Upon completion of the approval process, the buyer may issue a purchase order to the supplier(s) from which their items correspond. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Integrated Repository </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. Supplier items are sourced from any of the following: supplier catalogs, contracts, bid responses and quote responses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. The matching rules engine determines which items are to be returned to the buyer. Buyers may set the rules for which items they wish to view, or suppliers may set the rules for which items they wish the buyer to view. Rules are determined based on the following: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Buyer location&mdash;Buyers may be qualified for items based on their physical location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Buyer enforced&mdash;Buyers may specify only those suppliers from which they would purchase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Market segment&mdash;buyers qualify for items based on the segment of the market they belong to e.g. state, government or education sector </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Cooperative&mdash;buyers qualify for items that are available to a cooperative they belong to </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Contract rules&mdash;Specific contracts may apply only to certain buyers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Supplier enforced&mdash;Suppliers may specify only those buyers to which they wish to sell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Quote/bid rules&mdash;Quote and bid responses may be restricted to certain buyers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. Buyers may store selected items from the integrated repository into one or more list(s). Lists may be generic, shared within an organization or specific to a user. These lists are saved for processing at a later time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. Supplier catalogs are normalized and categorized into the integrated repository. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. Contracts may be created in the integrated repository in one of at least two ways. The first way is by loading/mapping existing contracts into the integrated repository and assigning matching rules to those contracts. The second way occurs upon the conversion of an accepted bid into a contract. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. After a buyer accepts a response to a bid, the response can be converted to a contract that may be used for future purchases by that buyer, or by several buying organizations (depending, for example, on the terms of the contract). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>. A supplier may specify that the response applies to buyers outside of the initiating buyer&apos;s organization. In other words, one buying organization may choose to leverage another buying organization&apos;s research by purchasing off of their bid response. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. Terms of any request for quote response may be set by a supplier to allow other multiple buying organizations to purchase off of that quote response. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Supplier </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. All data that is stored in the integrated repository is assigned matching rules to specify the target buying audience for the created item data. Suppliers are provided the ability to establish the matching rules in an attempt to ensure that the right buyers view their corresponding item information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. Tools are available to allow a large number of supplier catalogs to be created in the integrated repository. For example, a supplier may provide a supplier identified SKU, Description, Packaging, classification, and other product data relevant to listing in a catalog. Tools are provided to load, classify, and maintain the data and the applicability of the catalog to the buyers and buyer hierarchies based on any criteria available in the database. Items within these catalogs are normalized, mapped into the appropriate categories, and assigned matching rules. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>. Tools are available to allow an infinite number of supplier/buyer contracts to be created in the integrated repository. A tool is provided for creating and maintaining the applicability of any particular contract to any particular user both by the supplier and the buyer that initiated the contract. The rules for sharing the contract are varied and can include criteria such as location, business status, financial rating, and so on. Items within these contracts are normalized, mapped into the appropriate categories, and assigned matching rules. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. Upon submitting a bid response to the buyer, a supplier may specify terms for the response to allow multiple buying organizations to leverage research already performed by a single buying organization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>. Upon submitting a quote response to the buyer, a supplier may specify terms for the response to allow multiple buying organizations to leverage research already performed by a single buying organization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. Upon completion of the research and approval process of a particular buying organization, the supplier may receive and fulfill a submitted purchase order. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Now, a flowchart is provided in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> that illustrates how the integrated repository is utilized. Specifically, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates a functional flow of events corresponding to the buyer and supplier as each event relates to the integrated repository. The flow is categorized into the following areas: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Research&mdash;Flow of events to support a buyer&apos;s research of items for purchase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Approval&mdash;Flow of events to support the buyer&apos;s purchasing approval process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Purchase&mdash;Flow of events to support the actual purchasing of items. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Buyer </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>. A buyer may perform any of the functional duties (research, approval, and purchase) at any time, depending on existing processes. Buyers find the desired product items through a research process, which can be executed at different phases of the procurement process. The buyer may invoke the research process at the beginning of the procurement process or at any time through the approval or purchasing process. During the approval or purchasing process, the buyer might decide to buy another item (or group of items) and invoke the research process in the middle of the approval or purchase process. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Research </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight>. The buyer is provided search or browse functionality to identify the items for purchase from the integrated repository. Searchable/browseable data comes from any of the following: supplier catalogs, contracts, request for bid responses and request for quote responses. During the research process, the buyer may either search/browse the entire integrated repository by specifying the desired source of the items or perform a generic search/browse across all sources. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>. Based on the buyer&apos;s profile, the matching rules engine determines the appropriate items from the integrated repository to present information to the buyer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> <highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight>. Items from supplier catalogs are available to the buyer and include information about the specified items the buyer chooses to research. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>. Items from contracts are available to the buyer and include contract information (items and contract descriptions) about the specified contracts the buyer chooses to research. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight>. Responses to requests for bids and to requests for quote are available to the buyer and include detailed response information from the suppliers allowing the buyer to leverage research already performed on specific items. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight>. Provided a supplier has a &ldquo;punchout&rdquo; solution available, the buyer may be directed to and choose to retrieve items directly from a supplier&apos;s internal web catalog solution This option is specifically useful if a supplier offers configurable items for sale on its website. This option allows the buyer to navigate to the supplier&apos;s web site, select the desired items and incorporate them in the buyer&apos;s list of items for purchase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> <highlight><bold>607</bold></highlight>. If the buyer is satisfied with the items retrieved from the integrated repository, the buyer may proceed to the next event. Otherwise, the buyer may choose to return to the beginning of the research process to perform additional searching or browsing of the integrated repository. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight>. Once the buyer is satisfied with the item for which they are searching, the item may be added to a saved list from which they can either continue searching/browsing for additional items, or proceed to the next step. Buyers may choose to create multiple lists, some of which may be continuously reused to leverage past research. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> <highlight><bold>609</bold></highlight>. After the buyer has completed their item list, they may proceed to the next event. If not, they may return to the beginning of the research process to continue searching or browsing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>. Now that the buyer has a completed list, they determine if they have the appropriate pricing information to proceed to the next event. If the buyer must obtain additional pricing information, they may submit a request for bid or request for quote to one or many suppliers for some or all of the items on their list. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> <highlight><bold>611</bold></highlight>. Once a buyer has completed all research for the items, they proceed to either the approval process or the purchasing process. If approval is required, they proceed to the approval process. Otherwise, they may be directed to the purchasing process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight>. A buyer may create either a request for bid or request for quote. The buyer may choose to issue their request for bid or request for quote to one or many suppliers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> <highlight><bold>613</bold></highlight>. Once a buyer has issued their request for bid or request for quote, including attributes such as when the response is needed by or specific terms and conditions, they receive responses from their selected suppliers. Another mechanism for generating pricing is an informal quote process. In this environment, a buyer communicates through the system with multiple suppliers to request quotes on one or many items. The supplier, in turn, communicates back through the system either typing information in free form, entering information in discrete fields similar to the fields mentioned above, or by attaching any number of electronic documents such as spreadsheets, word processing documents, web pages, or other formats. The suppliers also have the option of replying through phone or fax and the information is captured on the buyer&apos;s side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight>. The supplier&apos;s response to all requests for bids or requests for quote are written to the database to be researchable by other buying organizations. However, the supplier may specify matching rules to allow only targeted buying organizations to purchase from those responses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> <highlight><bold>615</bold></highlight>. From all responses the buyer receives, they may choose to accept or not accept. If they are not satisfied with any of the responses, they may either issue a new request for bid or request for quote, or return to the beginning of the research cycle. If they accept a response, they proceed to the next event. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> <highlight><bold>616</bold></highlight>. If the buyer requires additional items, they may continue the research process. Otherwise, the items (with pricing information) from their request for bid or request for quote are added to their list. </paragraph>

Responses to requests for bids are stored in the integrated repository and may be searched or created according to buyer/supplier specified matching rules. That is, the audit information is captured, formatted and loaded into a database for reference by the other potential users of the site. Typical fields found and captured are the sharing clause in the contract, contract validity dates, location of supplier, and so on. In some embodiments the data captured are all the winning bids and the losing bids together as well as a record of the request as it went out originally. The losing bids become a part of the audit trial (with time and date) and are stored and published according to similar mechanisms as described for contracts. </paragraph>
