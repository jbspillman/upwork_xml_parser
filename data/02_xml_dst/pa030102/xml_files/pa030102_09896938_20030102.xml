<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to battery assemblies and, in particular, to battery assemblies in which the electrodes of the cells are connected in series to form the battery assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Battery assemblies are typically composed of battery cells which are connected electrically in series. Each battery cell is itself composed of a plurality of positive and negative battery electrodes. The positive and negative battery electrodes of a battery cell are connected to respective cell terminals which are assembled through the cell cover. The series intercell connections are then realized by connecting each positive cell terminal with the succeeding negative cell terminal using a metal bus bar. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Attempts have been made to simplify the interconnection between cells by eliminating the bus bars and connecting the cell electrodes through the cell walls. Battery assemblies employing such through-the-wall connections are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 3,914,134. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide a battery assembly having improved through-the-wall connection assemblies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is also an object of the present invention to provide a battery assembly having through-the-wall connection assemblies which provide improved sealing of the compartments of the battery assembly, enhanced electrical performance, improved manufacturability, better quality and lower cost. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the principles of the present invention, the above and other objectives are realized in a battery assembly comprised of a container having internal walls which separate the container into compartments. A plurality of sets of electrodes are disposed in each compartment and each set of electrodes includes a number of positive and a number of negative electrodes arranged in interleaved fashion. The battery assembly further comprises a number of through-the-wall connection assemblies. Each through-the-wall connection assembly connects the electrodes of a first polarity in a given compartment to the electrodes of a second polarity in an adjacent compartment through an aperture in the internal wall separating the compartments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In accord with the invention, each through-the-wall connection assembly includes first and second members. The first member has opposing first and second surfaces and the second member opposing third and fourth surfaces. The first surface of the first member and the third surface of the second member each have a projection extending outward of the respective surface. The second surface of the first member and the fourth surface of the second member each have a groove outward of a predetermined portion of the respective surface and the battery assembly further comprises first and second elastic members situated in the grooves of the second and third surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The first and second members of each through-the-wall connection assembly are arranged with the predetermined portion of the second face of the first member and the predetermined portion of the fourth face of the second member abutting each other through the aperture in the associated container wall and with the grooved areas of the faces abutting the first and second surfaces of the container wall adjacent such aperture to provide a compression seal around the aperture. The projection of the first face of the first member and the projection of the third face of the second member are, in turn, coupled, respectively, to the electrodes of the first polarity in the given compartment and to the electrodes of the second polarity in the adjacent compartment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Welding is used to connect the abutting second and fourth faces of the first and second members and to connect the first and third faces of the first and second members to the respective electrodes. The resultant through-the-wall connection assemblies are thus of simpler construction, have improved leakage resistance characteristics, enhanced electrical performance, easier manufacturability, better quality and lower cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In the invention to be disclosed hereinafter, the first and second members are of button or disk like configuration, the projections are of dome or hemisphere shape and the battery electrodes are provided with tabs which connect to the respective projections. Also, the grooves follow a circular path and the elastic members are formed as O-rings which snap into the grooves preventing loss during assembly. Additionally, the predetermined portions of the second and fourth surfaces are stepped areas inward of the grooves to facilitate connection of the members. This prevents misalignment and failed welds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In a further aspect of the invention, the stepped area of the second surface of each first member is provided with a raised annular area and the stepped area of the fourth surface of each second member is provided with a corresponding annular slot which mate when the second and fourth surfaces are brought together. The raised area provides a mechanism for energy concentration during welding, and the annular slot, by engaging the raised area, enhances alignment of the first and second members. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In another version, the stepped area of the second surface of each first member is again provided with a raised annular area for energy concentration during welding and, additionally, inward of the raised area, with a keyway which extends through the stepped area into the body of the first member. In this case, the stepped area of the fourth surface of each second member is provided with a pin which is adapted to mate with the keyway of the associated first member for aligning the members when they are brought together.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows an isometric view and FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> show a top view and a side view of a battery assembly <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in accordance with the principles of the present invention. As shown, the battery assembly <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> comprises an outer casing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> with flat front and back walls <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and opposing right and left side walls <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. A flange area <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> extends about the upper edges of these walls and provides a seating area for a cover <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> (not shown) which closes the top of the battery assembly <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The casing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is separated into compartments <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> by internal walls <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Each compartment houses a set of negative electrodes <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and a set of positive electrodes <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> which are arranged in spaced interleaved fashion. The first end compartment <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> also houses a negative terminal <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> which extends outward of the compartment and the top cover and serves as the negative battery terminal of the battery assembly <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Similarly, the second end compartment <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> houses a positive terminal <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> which extends outward of this compartment through the top cover to serve as the positive terminal of the battery assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In order for the negative and positive electrodes <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in the battery compartments <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> to be electrically connected in series between the negative and positive battery terminals <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, tabs <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> are connected to the negative electrodes in a compartment and tabs <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are connected to the positive electrodes in an adjacent compartment and an assembly <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is provided for connecting the tabs of adjacent compartments. Tabs <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and tabs <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> are also provided for connecting the negative electrodes of the first end compartment <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the positive electrodes of the second end compartment <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> to the respective negative and positive battery terminals <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The assemblies <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> for connecting the tabs <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and the tabs <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of adjacent compartments are configured as through-the-wall connection assemblies and they connect their respective tabs by extending through apertures <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> in the internal walls <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. More particularly, in accordance with the invention, each of the assemblies <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> includes cooperating button or disk members <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> As can be seen in FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is of a circular disk shape with opposing first and second surfaces <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Protruding outward from the first surface <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is a dome or hemisphere shaped projection <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. The second surface <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, in turn, includes a circular groove <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and inward of the groove a circular stepped region <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. The stepped region <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> also includes an annular slot <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Turning to FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the member <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is also of circular disk shape with opposing first and second surfaces <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. A dome or hemisphere shaped projection <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> extends outward of the surface <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and the surface <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> includes a circular groove <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. A stepped region <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> is situated inward of the groove <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and an annular raised area <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> of triangular cross section extends outward of the stepped area <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> shows an exploded view of the connection assembly <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> connecting respective tabs <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> together at the aperture <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> situated in the inner wall <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> between the compartments <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the casing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. As shown, the grooves <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> of the members <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> serve to receive elastic members <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>, shown as O-rings, when the assembly <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is situated in place adjacent the aperture <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. The O-rings are held in the grooves without the need of any additional securing means such as adhesives or solvents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the members <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> are arranged with the stepped regions <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> of the surfaces <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> of the member <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> are placed in aligned abutting relationship. Alignment of the stepped regions is facilitated by the raised area <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> of the stepped area <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> seating in the slot <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> of the stepped area <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. Also, this brings the grooves <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> of the surfaces <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> in abutting relationship with the opposing wall surfaces of the wall <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> adjacent the aperture <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The presence of the raised area <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> provides an area for concentrating energy when the members <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> are welded together. Likewise, during welding, the projections <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> of the members <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> serve as welding nipples facilitating the welding of the tabs <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> to the members. The O-rings in the grooves <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> abutting the wall surfaces further provide a compression seal around the aperture <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the stepped area <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> of the second surface <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of the first member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> can be formed as a flat surface without the groove <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, if alignment considerations are not of significant concern. In such case, the member <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> can still be provided with the raised area <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> for energy concentration during welding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> show sectional views of modified versions of the members <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, respectively, of the through-the-wall connection assembly <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> of the invention. In these modified versions, the members are provided with additional mating parts which together form an alignment mechanism. In particular, the stepped area <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> of the member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, instead of having an annular groove, is provided with a central keyway <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>. This keyway extends through the stepped area into the body of the member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The stepped area <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> of the member <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, in turn, is provided inward of the raised area <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, with a pin <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> configured to mate with the keyway <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> When the members <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> of FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are brought together, the pin <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> seats in the keyway <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>. This ensures alignment of the members and enhances the subsequent welding of the members together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the casing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> including the interior walls <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the casing can be formed from molded plastic. The tabs <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> can be made of nickel and the tabs <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> of silver plated copper. The members <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> typically can be made from cold rolled steel with a nickel plating and the O-rings <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> from EPDM material. The battery electrodes can be electrodes for any type of battery, including, for example, nickel-zinc batteries. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Typical dimensions for the disk like members <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> are indicated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In all cases it is understood that the above-described arrangements are merely illustrative of the many possible specific embodiments which represent applications of the present invention. Numerous and varied other arrangements can be readily devised in accordance with the principles of the present invention without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. </paragraph>
