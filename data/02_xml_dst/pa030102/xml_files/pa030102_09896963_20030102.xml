<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention is related to the field of user interfaces for electronic input devices, and more particularly, and to a user touch-activated screen interface for a handwriting recognition system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> As electronic devices, such as computers, mobile telephones, PDAs and the like have become more commonplace, users expect those electronic devices to become more versatile and easier to use. One manner in which manufacturers have attempted to meet that expectation is in the form of the user interface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Manufacturers have upgraded the user interfaces of even the smallest of devices to include features such as color displays, and human-centered ergonomic improvements. One specific improvement is in providing interfaces that permit handwritten input, by way of handwriting recognition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Many different systems exist for recognizing handwritten characters, and outputting text in response to manuscript input is taught. Examples of such systems are disclosed in PCT Patent document Nos. WO 96/00424 and WO 98/29791, and in U.S. Pat. No. 6,195,638. These systems, however, do not deal with the user interface for inputting the handwriting, but rather with how to decipher it once it is input. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A common and popular device which permits handwritten input is sold under the name PALM PILOT&reg; by Palm, Inc. The PALM PILOT&reg; includes a dedicated touch-activated portion of its video display for inputting handwritten characters in a handwriting recognition system known as GRAFFITI&reg;. While it is helpful for the user to have a known place that is usable for handwritten input, the dedicated area has its drawbacks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> First, the dedicated area is of a fixed and immutable size. The user may need more, or less room at any given time, and a fixed-size dedicated area is not always the right size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Second, the dedicated area may not be in the most useful place, as the user may prefer for it to be in a different place, for example, a left-handed user may prefer to move the area to a place more suitable for his input. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Third, the dedicated area takes up a constant amount of space on the display, even when not in use. Especially on small devices, such as a PDA, losing a significant area of a user&apos;s screen for a manuscript input area when she is not using that input is bothersome. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Another electronic device permitting manuscript input to a dedicated area established for handwriting is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,049,862. This device, as well, however, does not address the drawbacks listed above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> There is thus a need for a user interface for providing a more flexible user input for manuscript input to an electronic device. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and system for a user interface for an electronic device that is more adaptable and useful than known systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> It is a further object of the invention to provide a method and system for providing a user interface for a handwriting recognition system for an electronic device in which the user inputs handwritten characters into a semi-transparent window which appears on a video display for such electronic device in response to the user moving a stylus across a touch-activated screen of the video display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> It is a still further object of the invention to provide a semi-transparent window for a user interface in a handwriting recognition system in which the semi-transparent window may be moved and sized depending upon the particular needs and preferences of the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The present invention is a method and system for a user interface of a handwriting recognition system intended for use in small electronic devices, such as PDAs, mobile telephones and laptop computers. However, the present invention may be used with a device of any size, including a desk-top computer, a mainframe computer, or even a consumer appliance such as a microwave oven. The user interface is a semi-transparent window that opens in response to a user-initiated manuscript input to any point on a touch-activated screen of a display of or associated with the electronic device. The touch-screen need not be a part of the device, as is the case with a PDA, mobile phone and laptop computer, but may also be merely connected, electronically or wirelessly, to the electronic device, as is the case with a desk-top computer. The semi-transparent window may be sized or moved, as desired by the user, and may be automatically sizable in response to the placement of the user&apos;s manuscript input on the touch-activated screen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Other objects and features of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. It is to be understood, however, that the drawings are designed solely for purposes of illustration and not as a definition of the limits of the invention, for which reference should be made to the appended claims. It should be further understood that the drawings are not necessarily drawn to scale and that, unless otherwise indicated, they are merely intended to conceptually illustrate the structures and procedures described herein. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENTLY PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> depicts a video display <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, in accordance with the present invention. Display <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a semi-transparent window <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> overlying a video display screen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which is preferably touch-activated. Semi-transparent window <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is defined by boundaries <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and is distinguished from the surrounding area of video display screen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, for example, by boundary lines, or by being of a different color or brightness. The color and brightness of semitransparent window <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are selected so that the features of the underlying video display screen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are still visible, thereby permitting the user to see what lies beneath semi-transparent window <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> yet still permitting the user also to see the contents of the overlying semitransparent window <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The user may input a manuscript character <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, for example, the letter &ldquo;I&rdquo;, and that character will be recognized by handwriting recognition software in known fashion and output as the character &ldquo;I&rdquo; <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> on display <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in the position allotted therefor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a schematic representation of the components of the preferred embodiment of the inventive system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Some form of data processor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, such as that within a PDA, a mobile phone, computer or other electronic device, is coupled to a display <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, which includes a screen <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Screen <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is adapted to receive information from a user by being activated by an external input device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In the preferred embodiment, this activation may be by way of screen <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> being activated by touch, for example, by a stylus <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Although stylus <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be a device specially made for the particular touch-activated screen <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, it may also be any form of writing implement to input handwritten data, such as letters or numbers, to touch-activated screen <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Where screen <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is not touch-activated, input may be implemented by a mouse, trackball, joystick, electronic tablet or any other form of input device. In response to the movement of input device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> on screen <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, screen <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> sends a signal to data processor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> describing the movement of input device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Data processor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> generates a display signal for displaying on display <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> the handwriting as it is generated, so that the user has some feedback on what is being written. This display will stay on display <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> for a predetermined period of time, or until the user begins to write another character. In this fashion, the user is able to keep track of what he or she has written. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The pattern of the handwritten character is relayed to handwriting recognition software <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (which may be stored in data processor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>). Handwriting recognition software <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> analyzes the user&apos;s manuscript input, and then generates a signal to data processor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> identifying the manuscript characters as specific letters or numbers. These characters are then relayed to display <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> for display to the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Data processor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is also coupled to a data storage area <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, which may also be a part of the data processor&apos;s memory, for storing user preferences and other data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, before commencing use of the system, a user must establish certain preferences, step <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, or accept the default preferences of the system. For example, the user must select the manner in which semi-transparent window <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is rendered distinct from the background of video display screen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. This may be accomplished by selecting a translucent coloring for semi-transparent screen <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, by selecting a different brightness therefor, etc. Other modes of differentiation may be established as well, and the user must select which mode is to be used, although system defaults may require the use of a specific format, according to the features of the display, to provide the user with the optimal mode for differentiation between the appearances of semi-transparent window <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the remainder of video display screen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Another preference to be established is the size and position of semi-transparent window <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> upon its initial presentation on display <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. For most languages, including English, the screen might open so that the open area of semi-transparent window <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is to the right of the opening point. For other languages which are written right to left, the opening might be on the opposite side of the opening point, to make it easier for the user to write in accustomed format. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Semi-transparent window <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> also must be positioned vertically with respect to the opening point, and it is preferred that the position of semi-transparent window <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> relative to the opening touching of the input device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to screen <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> be selected so that the natural movement of the user in writing the desired manuscript character will be in the direction of the middle of semi-transparent window <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Default orientations may be established depending upon the language of the user, whether the user is right- or left-handed, the requirements of the particular handwriting recognition software, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Once these preferences are established, the user may begin use of the inventive system in the normal course of his or her practice. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In addition, the system may be set up so that any one or more of the pre-selected preferences may be changed after semi-transparent window <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has been opened. This feature might be desirable, for example, if printed text displayed on the screen interferes more than desired with the pre-selected location of semi-transparent window <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Semi-transparent window <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be moved or resized in a way similar to that used in various known programs. For example, to resize semi-transparent window <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the user might touch stylus <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to a portion of the edge of semi-transparent window <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and drag this edge in the desired direction, thereby increasing or decreasing the size of semi-transparent window <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. To move semi-transparent window <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the user may touch with stylus <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> a particular place on semi-transparent window <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and drag the entire semi-transparent window <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to a new position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> To initiate the opening of the user interface, the user may simply contact touch-activated screen <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, step <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, at any desired location (for example at point <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> where writing by the user begins). The initial contact of stylus <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to screen <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> causes screen <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to generate a signal to data processor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, which then accesses the preferences established for opening semi-transparent window <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and uses those preferences to generate, step <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, semi-transparent window <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on display <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The user continues to write the manuscript character(s) in semi-transparent window <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, while screen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> sends the output, step <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, showing the movement of stylus <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> thereon to data processor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> which generates an output showing the handwritten input, step <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, as it is written, and simultaneously sends the pattern of the manuscript character to the handwriting recognition software <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, step <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The display will stay active as determined by system preferences, for example, while the user is writing a single block of text, such as a single character, or word. As each new block of text is commenced and, identified, for example, by lifting stylus <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> from touch-activated screen <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, the prior display may be cleared. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the preferences may be established so that the displayed character <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> remains displayed for a predetermined period of time, e.g., 2 seconds, after the last input from input device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to video display screen <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Once the pattern is completed, handwriting recognition software <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> determines the intended character, and sends it, step <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, through data processor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to be presented on display <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> (see letter <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In this fashion, system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> conveniently and efficiently generates typed characters in response to manually generated character input. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> If the user wishes, he may move or size semi-transparent window <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, step <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The display window <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may provide for switching between capital letters and small letters, numbers or an international character set, for example, by touching with the stylus <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> the virtual buttons <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of semi-transparent window <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Semi-transparent window <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may also provide for the display of a virtual keyboard having letter keys and/or number keys which would allow the user to select particular letters and/or numbers by touching the keys with the stylus. Preferably, such a virtual keyboard would be semitransparent to allow viewing of content under the window. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Semi-transparent window <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may also have a virtual button <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> which when activated will cause semi-transparent window <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to de-activate and disappear completely. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> As a further option, certain software may provide for the automatic opening of semi-transparent window <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as a prompt to the user for input to respond to a specific data entry field, for example, as a response to an e-mail, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, or in response to an internet web site which requires the entry of information or the completion of a form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Thus, while there have shown and described and pointed out fundamental novel features of the invention as applied to preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood that various omissions and substitutions and changes in the form and details of the methods and devices described and illustrated, and in their operation, may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the invention. For example, it is expressly intended that all combinations of those elements and/or method steps which perform substantially the same function in substantially the same way to achieve the same results are within the scope of the invention. Moreover, it should be recognized that structures and/or elements and/or method steps shown and/or described in connection with any disclosed form or embodiment of the invention may be incorporated in any other disclosed or described or suggested form or embodiment as a general matter of design choice. It is the intention, therefore, to be limited only as indicated by the scope of the claims appended hereto. </paragraph>
