<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to material handling equipment, and more particularly to a telescoping bridge crane system particularly arranged to be mounted over a floor of a structure, e.g., in the interior of the body of a truck, to provide maximum headroom between it and the floor of the structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Various bridge crane systems and devices are commercially available for use in over-the-road vehicles, such as trailer bodies, vans, trucks, and the like to enable the vehicle to be loaded and unloaded. For example, some devices and systems make use top running bridges mounted within the trailer adjacent the ceiling. In order to extend out of the trailer such bridges make use of hinged runways which are arranged to be held within a stowed position within the interior of the trailer body, and then to fold out of the rear of the trailer so that a portion extends beyond the end of the trailer to facilitate the loading and unloading of the trailer. This approach limits the storage space within the trailer in order to maintain clearance for the movement of the folding runway. It also requires a set-up procedure before the system is ready for use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> So-called &ldquo;enclosed track&rdquo; bridge crane systems solve the problem of load-lifting coverage beyond the runway and bridge envelope by utilizing telescoping bridges or runways each formed of an elongated hollow track section. In particular, at least one enclosed track is mounted horizontally at an elevated position and includes at least one wheel truck or trolley arranged to roll therein. The truck(s)/trolley(s) serve to suspend another enclosed track horizontally below the upper track. The lower enclosed track can be extended longitudinally with respect to the upper enclosed track, i.e., the truck(s)/trolley(s) can be rolled along the upper track from a stowed or a retracted position within the upper track to an extended position (also within the upper track but closer to its rear end). This action enables the lower track to be extended substantially beyond the rear end of the upper track section. A hoist or other lifting member can be mounted directly or indirectly on the lower track to enable the lifting of some load. Examples of such bridge crane systems are commercially available under the trademark MET-TRACK&reg; Stand Alone Workstation Bridge Cranes from Spanco, a division of Transol Corporation, the assignee of the subject application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> While the use of upper and lower enclosed tracks requires no additional set-up, it nevertheless also results in the loss of valuable headroom, particularly if the system is utilized in a confined space, such as within a trailer or other hollow vehicle body. Moreover, such telescoping or runways must be located directly below the fixed (upper) track or runway to prevent moment loading on the truck(s)/trolleys supporting the lower track or runway, since such trucks/trolleys are not typically amenable for supporting moment loads. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Examples of other types of prior art devices and systems for enabling a vehicle body to be loaded and unloaded are also found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,360,307 (Larsson), 4,425,071 (Dunbar), 5,062,760 (Samaniego), 5,338,147 (Kucharczyk et al.), 5,743,702 (Gunderson), and 6,126,379 (Feldman et al.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> While the aforementioned prior art devices and systems may be suitable for their intended purposes they never the less leave much to be desired from one or more standpoints, e.g., taking up considerable headroom in the interior of the vehicle, complexity, cost, ease of operation, ability to handle loads extending substantially beyond the bounds of the vehicle interior, etc. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> This invention entails a system, e.g., a low headroom telescoping bridge crane system, for suspending a load over a floor, e.g., the floor of a vehicle, such as a truck body, or a static structure, such as a building. The system comprises a first, second, third, and fourth elongated, enclosed, hollow tracks, plural elongated cross members, a plurality of trucks (e.g., wheeled carriages), and a plurality of generally U-shaped hangers. Each of the tracks includes a longitudinally extending slot. Each of the hangers has a downwardly extending leg, an intermediate section and an upwardly extending leg. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The first and second tracks are disposed parallel to each other over the floor. The third and fourth tracks are also disposed parallel to each other and are interconnected by at least one of the cross members to form a runway frame. A first one of the trucks is located within the first track and arranged to move along the interior of the first track. A second one of the trucks is located within the second track and arranged to move along the interior of the second track. The first truck is connected to a downwardly extending leg of a first of the hangers, with a portion of the first hanger passing through the slot in the first track, and with the upwardly extending leg of the first hanger being connected to the third track to support the third track beside and parallel to the first track. The second truck is connected to a downwardly extending leg of a second of the hangers, with a portion of the second hanger passing through the slot in the second track, and with the upwardly extending leg of the second hanger being connected to the fourth track to support the fourth track beside and parallel to the second track, whereupon the runway frame is disposed horizontally between the first and second tracks and can be slid in a horizontal plane from a retracted position to an extended position and vice versa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In accordance with one exemplary embodiment of this invention two trucks are located in each of the first and second tracks to support respective portions of the third and fourth tracks making up the runway frame. In addition, a bridging section is provided extending between the third and fourth tracks of the runway frame and is supported from movement therealong by a pair of trucks located within the third and fourth tracks of the runway frame. A hoist or other lifting member may be mounted on the bridging section.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> there is shown one exemplary embodiment of a low headroom telescoping bridge crane system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> constructed in accordance with the subject invention. The system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> makes use of a pair of elevated runways for supporting an extendable retractable runway frame therebetween, with the runway frame carrying a bridge section on which a conventional &ldquo;end-effector&rdquo; or a &ldquo;below-the-hook&rdquo; lifting device, such hoist, balancer, vacuum lifter, etc. is mounted. The system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has particularly suitability for mounting or disposition within the hollow body of a vehicle, e.g., in an over-the-road trailer, a truck, a van, etc., to facilitate the loading and unloading of the vehicle&apos;s body. However, it must be pointed out at this juncture that the system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can also be used in a static environment, e.g., within a building, in a yard or other open area, etc. To that end, the subject invention can be used in any application which requires low headroom and reach beyond the envelope of the system to lift and maneuver loads thereat. In mobile environments, such as when the system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is used in a truck or van body like shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> (and which will be described later), the system is mounted so that its runways and the supported runway frame assembly are located in the same plane immediately adjacent the ceiling or roof of the vehicle&apos;s hollow body, e.g., the trailer. This low headroom arrangement provides maximum space between it, the lifting device suspended from the bridge section of the runway frame assembly, and the floor of the structure in which the system is mounted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> basically comprises support frame assembly <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, including the pair of heretofore mentioned runways, the heretofore mentioned runway frame assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and a conventional lifting device, e.g,. hoist <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. In the exemplary embodiment shown herein, the support frame assembly <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> comprises plural, e.g., four, upright support columns or posts <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>C, and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>D, a pair of outside tracks <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, plural, e.g., two, cross members <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, plural, e.g., four, trolleys or trucks <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 7</cross-reference>) and associated hangers <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The outside tracks <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> make up the heretofore identified pair of runways and are arranged to slidably support the support frame assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> therebetween. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The runway frame assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> comprises a pair of inside tracks <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, plural, e.g., two, cross members <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, a pair of trolleys or trucks <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>), a pair of hangers <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 6</cross-reference>), and a bridge section <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The bridge section <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> serves to support, e.g., suspend, the lifting device <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> therefrom, and in the exemplary embodiment shown herein is in the form of an enclosed track (to be described later) including a trolley <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> from which the lifting device <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is suspended. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The two outside tracks <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> forming the system&apos;s runways are disposed parallel to each other and in the same elevated horizontal plane by the plural, hollow support columns <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>C, and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>D. As mentioned earlier the outside tracks (runways) serve to support the runway frame assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> between them and in the same plane as the outside tracks <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The mounting of the runway frame assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> between the outside tracks <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is effected by use of the trucks/trolleys <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and the associated hangers <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, respectively. When so mounted the runway frame assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is arranged to be slid down the runways <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> between a retracted position (to be described in detail later) wherein the runway frame assembly is located within the &ldquo;envelope&rdquo; of the mounting frame assembly <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (i.e., the cross members <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>) and a fully extended position (also to be described later) wherein a portion of the runway frame assembly is located beyond the &ldquo;envelope&rdquo; of the mounting frame assembly, and vice versa. In fact, the runway frame assembly can be located at any intermediate position between the retracted and fully extended positions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 7</cross-reference> the bridging section <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is mounted transversely with respect to the inside tracks <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> via the trolleys <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, respectively, and their associated hangers <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, respectively, so that the bridging section can be located at any longitudinal position along the tracks <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> As mentioned earlier, the support columns <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>C, and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>D are arranged to support the runways <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> at the elevated horizontal position. In accordance with the exemplary embodiment shown herein each of the support columns is of identical construction and is in the form of an elongated linear hollow member formed of any suitable strong material, e.g., steel. Each member includes a flanged lower end in the form of a base plate <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> for mounting the column in a vertical orientation on the floor of the vehicle body or on any other surface, e.g., the floor of a building or the ground of a yard, in which the system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is to be located. The upper end of each support column includes an angular connector flange <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> to which a horizontal support yoke <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is fixedly secured, e.g., welded. As will be described shortly, each horizontal support yoke <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is arranged to suspend a portion of an associated one of the outside tracks <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> below it and to enable the tracks to be adjusted with respect to each other to maintain their parallelism. In addition, each yoke supports a respective end of an associated cross member <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. To that end, each yoke includes a pair of spaced apart arms which are fixedly secured, e.g., welded, to an associated end of an associated cross member <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, the cross member <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is fixedly secured between the horizontal support yokes <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> on the columns <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>C, while the cross member <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is fixedly secured between the horizontal support yokes on the columns <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>D (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). The securement of the ends of the cross members to their respective yoke arms is accomplished by welding or some other attachment means, e.g., rivets, threaded fasteners, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The cross members <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are preferably mounted as close as possible above the outside tracks <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to minimize the system&apos;s headroom. To that end, each support yoke <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> includes a hollow interior space between its arms in which a slidable hanger member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is located and suspended. Each slidable hanger member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> comprises a short height bar or rod disposed vertically and having a pair of rod-like arms <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> projecting horizontally therefrom in opposed diametric directions. Each of the arms <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is located within a respective horizontally disposed elongated slot <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> in the pair of spaced arms making up the horizontal support yoke to enable the slidable hanger member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> to be slid to any longitudinal position along the slot <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. The lower end of each slidable hanger member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is fixedly secured (e.g., welded) to the top wall (to be described hereinafter) of a portion of one of the two outer tracks <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to suspend that track from the support yoke immediately below it. Thus, the runway track <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to which the hanger member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is secured is disposed and supported immediately below its associated cross frame member. Since each slidable hanger member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> can be slid along the associated slots <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> in its associated yoke <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> the spacing between the two outside tracks <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can be adjusted as desired. This enables the user of the system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to ensure that the tracks <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are maintained parallel to each other, since any skewing of those tracks could interfere with the smooth sliding of the runway frame assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> therebetween. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In the exemplary embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the columns <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>D are located at the far ends of the two outside tracks <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to support those ends of the tracks via their associated yokes and hangers. The other columns <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>C are located at the near ends of the two outside tracks <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to support those ends of the tracks via their associated yokes and hangers. It should be noted at this juncture that while the system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> as comprising four support columns, the system can make use of more or less such members to support the outside tracks at the elevated horizontal position, depending upon the length of the tracks and other matters, e.g., the amount of additional bracing that is utilized, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Turning now to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> the details of each of the outside tracks <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> will now be discussed. As can be seen each track is of a conventional &ldquo;enclosed-type&rdquo; construction. One particularly suitable enclosed track is that sold by Spanco, a division of Transol Corporation, the assignee of this invention, under the trademark Met-Track&reg;. Each track <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is an elongated member, formed of a strong material, e.g., steel, having a horizontally disposed top wall <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, a pair of vertical sidewalls <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> projecting downward from the top wall, a pair of angularly located sidewalls <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> located below the vertical sidewalls <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, and a pair of horizontally disposed flanges <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> projecting inward from the ends of the angularly located sidewalls <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> to form a slot <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> therebetween. Each track <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is arranged to receive at least one truck/trolley (to be described hereinafter) to slidably support the runway frame assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> between the tracks. In the exemplary embodiment the trucks/trolleys <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are located within the interior of the outside track <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, while the trucks/trolleys <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are located within the interior of the other outside track <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. All of the trucks/trolleys <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are of the same construction and will be described in detail later. Suffice it for now to state that each basically comprises a movable body member <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> having plural wheels or rollers <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> which are arranged to roll on respective inner surfaces of the flanges <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> on opposite sides of the slot <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> in the track in which the trolley is mounted. In accordance with one preferred exemplary embodiment of this invention each of the trucks is of conventional construction, such as that sold by Spanco, a division of Transol Corporation, as part of the MET-TRACK&reg; system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> As mentioned earlier, each truck/trolley includes a hanger secured thereto. Each hanger is a generally U-shaped member which serves as the means for supporting a portion of the associated inside tracks <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the runway frame assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. To that end, as best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the hanger associated with each truck/trolley mounted in an outside enclosed track basically comprises generally a U or J-shaped member having a first downwardly extending leg section <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, a transversely extending, e.g., arcuate, intermediate section <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, and an upwardly extending leg section <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The downwardly extending leg section is mounted on the trolley body <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> so that it extends downward through the slot <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> in the enclosed track. Accordingly, when the truck/trolley rolls along the flanges of that track, the downwardly extending section <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> does not bear against either edge of the flange forming the slot <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. Each hanger is of a rigid construction and formed of a strong material, e.g., steel. The outer surface of each of the upstanding leg portions <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of each hanger <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is fixedly secured, e.g., welded, to a respective portion of a respective one of the inside track sections <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> forming the runway assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, each track of the runway frame assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is of the same general shape as the externally located enclosed tracks <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the support frame assembly, but is of slightly smaller cross-sectional area. In the interest of brevity, the portions of the runway frame assembly tracks will be given the same reference numerals as the runway tracks <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The outside downwardly extending vertical wall <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> of each of the runway assembly tracks <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is secured to the outer surface of the upstanding end or leg portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of each of the hangers connected to the trolleys in the outside enclosed track sections <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> so that the tracks <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the runway frame assembly are located parallel to and beside (inside) the outside enclosed tracks <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, respectively, i.e., at virtually the same height with respect to the floor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Each of the enclosed tracks <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the runway frame assembly includes a single truck/trolley located therein. Thus, track <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> includes truck/trolley <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and track <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> includes truck/trolley <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The truck/trolleys <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of the runway are similar in construction to the truck/trolleys of the outside tracks <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> except that they are slightly smaller in size to fit within the smaller tracks. Thus each trolley includes plural rollers <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, and a body <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> from which a generally U or J-shaped hanger extends. Truck/trolley <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> supports hanger <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> therefrom, whereas truck/trolley <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> supports hanger <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> therefrom. Each hanger <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is identical in construction to the heretofore identified hangers and will be given the same reference numerals in the interest of brevity. Thus, as can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 9</cross-reference>, the upwardly extending leg <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of hanger <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is fixedly secured to a bracket or connector <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> at one end of the bridging section <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The connector is a hollow member which is fixedly secured (e.g., welded) to the leg section <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of hanger <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. One end of bridge section <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is located within the connector <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and is held in place by plural bolts <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>). The bridging section <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> as noted above is an elongated, hollow frame-like member, e.g., an enclosed track like those of the runways <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, but of smaller cross sectional area. At the opposite end of the bridging section is another bracket or connector <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> which is also fixedly secured to the upwardly extending leg portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the hanger <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> connected to the truck/trolley <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> in the other enclosed track <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the runway frame assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>, the details of the various trucks/trolleys of the system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can best be seen. Thus, as can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the truck/trolley <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> which is located within the enclosed track <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> closest to the end cross member <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> basically comprises a body <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> having four rollers or wheels <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> mounted thereon (two on each side of the body) on horizontally disposed axles. Two of the wheels <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> are located to run along the inside surface of the flange <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> of the outer wall of that track while the opposite two wheels roll along the upper surface of the opposed flange. In order to keep the truck/trolley <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> centered within the enclosed track <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> so that the hanger <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> does not rub against the edges of the slot <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> while the truck/trolley rolls therealong, the truck/trolley includes a pair of horizontally disposed idler or centering rollers or wheels <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> mounted at opposed ends of the body <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>. Each wheel <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is mounted on an axle oriented vertically so that each wheel is disposed in a horizontal plane. The diameter of the wheels is such that each makes contact with the opposed inner surfaces of the two vertically extending walls <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> of the enclosed track <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The other truck/trolley <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in the enclosed track <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is similarly constructed and arranged. The trolleys <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the other enclosed outside track <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are also constructed in the same manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The trucks/trolleys <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of the runway frame assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and which are located in the enclosed tracks <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are of identical construction to the trucks/trolleys <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> except that they are of slightly smaller size. In the interest of brevity, the same reference numbers are given to the same parts of the trucks/trolleys <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> are given to the trucks/trolleys <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> As mentioned earlier, the bridging section also preferably includes a trolley <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> therein for movably supporting a hoist or any other type of lifting mechanism <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> through the slot in the bottom of the track. The trolley <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> can be similar in construction to those described heretofore or can be of any other conventional construction. Thus, the hoist <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> can be moved to any longitudinal position along the length of the enclosed track forming the bridging section <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> there is shown the exemplary embodiment of a system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of this invention mounted within the hollow body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of a truck or van. The body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes atop wall <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a front wall <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a pair of side walls <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, a floor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and a rear wall in the form of one or more openable doors (not shown). The system is mounted in the body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> so that its support columns <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>D are secured to the floor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment shown the support column <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>B is located immediately adjacent the side wall <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> towards the front wall <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the support column <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>A is located immediately adjacent the side wall <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> towards the open rear wall, the support column <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>D is located immediately adjacent the opposite side wall <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> towards the front wall <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and the support column <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>C is located immediately adjacent that side wall <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> towards the open rear wall. It should be pointed out at this juncture that the embodiment <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> shown makes use of four support columns and two cross members. That is merely exemplary. Thus, the system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can make use of one or more support columns for the runways, depending upon the type of loads to be handled, the length of the runways, the amount of bracing provided, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, when the system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is mounted within the hollow interior of a vehicle body as just described, the runway frame assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can be moved from any retracted position within the envelope of the support frame assembly <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, to any extended position, wherein some portion of the runway frame assembly extends beyond the open rear end of the vehicle body. Depending upon the length of the inside track members, the runway frame assembly can be extended out of the rear of the truck body a substantial distance (e.g., almost equal to half the length of the runway frame assembly itself). With special construction it could extend even further. Since the bridging section <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> can be moved to any longitudinal position on the runway frame assembly, the lifting device <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> that is suspended by the trolley <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> from the bridging section <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> can be precisely positioned at any distance beyond the rear of the body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, up to the end of runway frame assembly. Moreover, the trolley <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> can be located to any position along the length of the bridging section. Thus, a load to be readily lifted into the truck body from virtually any position outside at the rear of the truck body. So too, a load can be lifted from virtually any position within the truck body and then the runway frame extended out of the truck body to a desired position and the bridging section and the hoist-supporting trolley can be moved to any position to deposit the load to virtually any position beyond the rear of the truck body. The runway frame assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can then be moved back to its retracted position for stowage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> It should be pointed out at this juncture that the system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> need not be mounted by support columns, but can itself be suspended by any suitable means from a ceiling or other structure so that the runway tracks and the runway assembly disposed therebetween is at any desired horizontal position. Moreover, the runway tracks <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the runway frame assembly tracks need not be of the enclosed type. Thus each track may be of an I-beam or some other shape to support a trolley or truck to slide/roll therealong. So, too, other types of carriers can be used in lieu of the trolleys/trucks to extend/retract the runway frame assembly between the runway tracks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Without further elaboration the foregoing will so fully illustrate my invention that others may, by applying current or future knowledge, adopt the same for use under various conditions of service. </paragraph>
