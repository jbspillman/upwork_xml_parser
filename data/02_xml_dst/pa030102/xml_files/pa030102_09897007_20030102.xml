<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to an enhanced location methodology for a location system, and is especially applicable to a timing-based location system. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Many modern location systems, such as Loran and the Global Positioning System, (GPS), are timing based. Measurements of the propagation delay of a signal between the target device (for which the location is to be determined) and one or more network devices (for which the locations are known) are used to obtain distance information, assuming that the time a signal takes to propagate is proportional to the distance the signal travels. Ranging systems estimate the distance between the target device and a network device, and time difference of arrival (TDOA) systems estimate the differences in the distances between the target device and a plurality of network devices based on the differences in the arrival times of signals traveling between the target device and the network devices. In both cases, these distance estimates are used to estimate the location of the target device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The simplest form of such a system is ranging. In a ranging system, a synchronization signal is sent from a network device to a target device, and the target device, in response, sends a timing signal that is detected by the network device. The network device is generally in a known location. The total propagation delay, multiplied by the propagation speed of the signal, gives the total distance traveled by the synchronization signal and the timing signal, which is equal to twice the distance between the target device and the network device (range data). This sequence may be reversed, with the target device sending the synchronization signal and the network device sending the timing signal, if the delay measurement is to take place on the target device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The distance between the target device and the network device, in two dimensions, defines a circular locus of points on which the device is located. This distance is generally combined with other information, such as the angle of arrival of the timing signal, to determine a location of the target device relative to the network device. In some implementations, multiple network devices are used to determine multiple distances between the target device and multiple known locations of network devices. However, using multiple ranging devices has the disadvantage of requiring the sending of a synchronization signal and a timing signal for each network device for which this ranging information is to be measured. The channel loading requirements are then the product of the number of target devices supported and the number of network devices involved with each target device. This second-order loading requirement often limits the number of location measurements that may be made in a given time frame. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In TDOA systems, such as Loran and GPS, a target device may send an unsynchronized signal that is detected by several network devices that are synchronized with each other, or a target device may receive signals from several network devices that are synchronized with each other but not synchronized with the target device. Although this does not directly give range data, it does give information about the differences in the distances between the target device and the various network devices (pseudo-range data). For any two network devices, the difference in the two propagation delays represents the difference in the distances from the target device to each of the network devices. As is well known in the art of location systems, this difference between the distances from the target device to each of two network devices establishes the set of possible locations as (in two dimensions) a hyperbolic locus. If three or more properly placed network devices (i.e., three devices not on the same line) are used in the measurement, it is usually possible to arrive at a unique two-dimensional solution (although certain cases may require a fourth properly placed network device). Most TDOA techniques involve heuristic or iterative solutions, since it is difficult to solve for the intersection of multiple arbitrary hyperbolae in a plane. Extension to three dimensions, requiring finding the intersection of multiple arbitrary hyperboloids, will only exacerbate this difficulty. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Both of these techniques described above suffer from an effect known in the art of location systems as geometric dilution of precision, or GDOP. A primary cause of this phenomenon is the failure of the circular or hyperbolic solution loci to intersect at right angles. Any timing error in the arrival time measurements or synchronizations will be multiplied by the cosecant of the angle of intersection of the two loci. The value of the cosecant is one (1) in the rare case where the angle of intersection is 90 degrees, and is greater at other angles, approaching infinity when the angle of intersection approaches zero or 180 degrees. For this reason, the three dimensional performance of GPS is limited on the vertical (height) axis because visible satellites are restricted to one side of the target device on the vertical axis, resulting in poor GDOP. The horizontal accuracy of the three dimensional performance of GPS is limited in occluded situations where part of the sky is not visible to the target device for the same reason. Further, most terrestrial based TDOA systems, in which the network devices are located substantially in a plane, are substantially incapable of offering any accurate vertical location information without supplementing the timing information with less reliable data, such as angle of arrival. Often, ranging is not an option in these systems due to the potential channel loading considerations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Thus, there exists a need for a technique which can offer improved range estimates without imposing a second-order channel loading requirement, which can provide a simple closed-form location solution instead of a complex or iterative algorithm, which can offer vertical location solutions using network devices arranged on a horizontal plane, and which can offer solution loci which intersect at angles as close as possible to 90 degrees. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In the interest of simplicity, the descriptions of location systems and techniques described herein use two-dimensional geometries except where specifically noted. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art of location systems that any of these systems and techniques may be directly extended to three dimensions or more. Although a typical system will require three or more network devices to arrive at a unique solution, the implementation and advantages of the present invention are most easily understood by focusing on a single pair of network devices and their interaction with a single target device. It will be understood by those skilled in the art of location systems that additional network devices will further improve the location estimates offered by any pair of network devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> typical network topology is illustrated having a first network device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, a second network device <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and a target device <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. It is assumed that the network devices <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are synchronized with each other or with a reference device (not shown). In accordance with the present invention, a synchronization signal is transmitted from the first network device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and, after propagating along a first distance <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, received by the target device <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. In response to this synchronization signal, the target device <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> sends a timing signal that, after propagating along a second distance <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> may be received by the second network device <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The second network device <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> estimates a time that the timing signal from the target device <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> arrives at the second network device <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The timing of this transaction is graphically illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. At a given time <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, the synchronization signal is transmitted from the first network device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. It is assumed that the value of the time <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is known to the first network device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, and may be reported to the second network device <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> or to a reference device. After a propagation delay <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> resulting from the finite propagation speed of the synchronization signal along the first distance <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the target device <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> detects the synchronization signal at a time <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. After a turnaround delay <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>, which may be any value (including zero), the target device <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> sends a timing signal in response to the synchronization signal at time <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>. It is assumed that the turnaround delay <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> is known to the second network device <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> or to a reference device, either because it has been established a priori or because the target device <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> reports the turnaround delay <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> to the second network device <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> or to a reference device in some manner. Minimizing the turnaround delay <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> will also minimize the effect of any clock error between the target device <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and the network devices <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> on the overall result. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> After a propagation delay <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> resulting from the finite propagation speed of the timing signal along the second distance <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, the second network device <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> at a time <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> detects the timing signal. The second network device <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may subtract the time <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> that the synchronization signal was transmitted by the first network device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> from the time <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> that the timing signal transmitted responsively by the target device <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> was detected by the second network device <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to establish the total delay between the transmitting of the synchronization signal and the detection of the timing signal. The second network device <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may further subtract the known turnaround delay <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> from that difference to determine the sum of the propagation delays <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>. Multiplying this result by the propagation speed of the signals (assuming that both signals propagate at substantially the same speed) will give the sum of the distances <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. These calculations described as being performed by the network device <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> may also be performed by the network device <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> or by any combination of the network devices <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, and other devices, as long as the devices know the value of the turnaround delay <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>, the time <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, and the time <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Since it is assumed that the locations of the network devices <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are known, the sum of the distances <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> defines an elliptical locus of points <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> on which the target device <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> may be located. This ellipse has foci at the locations of network devices <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. It is possible to estimate a location for the target device <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> in a system with more than two network devices by finding the point of intersection of several ellipses. However, this is not the most advantageous use of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, preferably both network devices <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> detect the timing signal transmitted by the target device <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. The sum of the distances <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> may then be detected as described above. Because both network devices <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> detect the timing signal, the difference between the distances <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> may be determined as is known in the prior art, defining a hyperbolic locus <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> on which the target device <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> may be located. The location of the target device <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> may then be determined to be one of the two points at which the ellipse <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> and the hyperbola <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> intersect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> This hyperbolic/elliptic combination has several advantages. With no overhead except for the sending of a single synchronization signal, which in most cases will actually improve system capacity over asynchronous operation, the locus of solutions for a pair of network devices is reduced from a curve to a pair of points. The locations of those points can be calculated in a simple, closed-form manner, instead of the iterative, computationally intensive methods generally involved in strictly hyperbolic (TDOA) systems. The distances <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and others may be readily established without requiring synchronization signals and associated responses from multiple network devices, as would be necessary in a traditional multipoint ranging system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Further, it can be demonstrated that the intersection of a hyperbola and a parabola constructed from the same two foci will inevitably be orthogonal (intersecting at precisely 90 degrees) at their point of intersection. The property of guaranteed orthogonality mitigates the part of the GDOP effect resulting from the angle of intersection of the solution loci. Even more significantly, if the network devices <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are assumed to be located in a horizontal plane (with the vertical dimension indicated by the building <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> depicted in the background of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>), it can be readily seen that the definition of the elliptical locus <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> provides a vertical result impossible with a strictly hyperbolic system, and exhibiting a much more desirable angle of intersection with the hyperbolic locus <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> than the corresponding circle <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> which would be offered by a traditional ranging system combined with a traditional TDOA system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> While the combination of the present invention with a TDOA system offers a number of unique advantages, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art of location systems that combining the elliptical solution locus of the present invention with the spherical solution locus of a ranging or a received signal strength information (&ldquo;RSSI&rdquo;) system, or with the linear solution locus of an angle if arrival (&ldquo;AOA&rdquo;) system, or with any other location systems, will result in improvements over the current art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, it is shown that inherent synchronization between network devices <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is not strictly necessary for implementation of the present invention. If the second network device <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is capable of detecting the synchronization signal sent by the first network device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the second network device <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> will detect the synchronization signal sent by the first device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> after it propagates along a third distance <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> from the first network device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to the second network device <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Using the time that the second network device <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> detects the synchronization signal from the first network device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, and the knowledge of the distance <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> between the first network device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and the second network device <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, the timing of the synchronization signal may be determined without a priori knowledge of the time <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> at which the synchronization signal was transmitted by the first network device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> as described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the timing of this implementation is similar to that described above with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> except that the second network device <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> further detects the synchronization signal at time <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight>, after a propagation delay <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> determined by the distance <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> between the first network device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and the second network device <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Since the network devices <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are at known locations, the distance <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> may be readily calculated and the propagation delay <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> easily known. Armed with the knowledge of the propagation delay <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> and arrival time <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> of the synchronization signal transmitted by the first network device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> at the second network device <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, the time of transmission <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> of the synchronization signal by the first network device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be determined by subtracting the known propagation delay <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> from the arrival time <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> of the synchronization signal from the first network device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> at the second network device <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and the sum of the distances <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> may be estimated as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> It will be apparent to those skilled in the art of mathematics that the intermediate step of determining the time of transmission <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> of the synchronization signal by the first network device is unnecessary, and that the difference between the sum of the propagation delays <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> and the propagation delay <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> is sufficient to establish the elliptical solution locus <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>, again assuming that the locations of the network devices <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the propagation speed of the signals are known. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Discussions to this point have involved a network-based implementation, where the timing information and location estimates are known to the network devices <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and/or to other devices in communication with them. The present invention, however, is also applicable to a subscriber-based system, where the target device <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> determines the timing information and estimates its own location. Such a system is depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, showing a protocol by which the target device <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> could establish similar information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the target device <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> may send a first synchronization signal that, after propagating along a first distance <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, is detected by the first network device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The first network device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may then responsively send a second synchronization signal that, after propagating along a second distance <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, is detected by the second network device <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The second network device <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may responsively send a timing signal that, after propagating along a third distance <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, is detected by the target device <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. The target device <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> may then establish the elliptical locus <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> as described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the target device <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> sends the first synchronization signal at time <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>. After a propagation delay <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> proportional to the distance <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> between the target device <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and the first network device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the first network device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> detects the first synchronization signal at a time <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>. After a turnaround delay <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight>, the first network device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> sends the second synchronization signal at a time <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>. The second network device <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> detects the second synchronization signal at a time <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight> after a propagation delay <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> proportional to the distance <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> between the first network device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and the second network device <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. After a second turnaround delay <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight>, the second network device <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> sends a timing signal at time <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight>. After a propagation delay <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> proportional to the distance <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> between the second network device <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the target device <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, the target device <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> detects the timing signal at time <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The target device <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> may be assumed to be privy to the time <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> at which it sent the first synchronization signal. The turnaround delays <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight> may also be assumed to be known to the target device <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, either because they are established a priori at both the target device <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and the network devices <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> or because they are transmitted to the target device <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. The propagation delay <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> is known because it is the product of the distance <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> between the network devices <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the propagation speed of the signal, and because, since the locations of the network devices <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are known, the distance <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> between them is readily calculated. Subtracting the transmission time <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> of the first synchronization signal from the detection time <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> of the timing signal, and further subtracting the known turnaround delays <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight> and the propagation delay <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> from that result, the sum of the propagation delays <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is derived. Multiplication by the propagation speed of the signal gives the sum of the distances <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. From that and knowledge of the location of the network devices <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, the ellipse <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> may be defined as described above. It will be clear to those skilled in the art of location systems that if the target device <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> further detects the first synchronization signal sent by the network device <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, a hyperbolic locus <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> may be constructed as in existing systems, such as GPS and Loran, which will complement the elliptical locus of the present invention. It will also be clear to those skilled in the art of location systems that, although the preferred embodiment describes synchronization of the network devices <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> by propagation of a synchronization signal between them, any implementation of synchronization between the network devices <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> that maintains a delay knowable to the target device <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> between the time of detection <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> of the first synchronization signal by the network device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and the time of transmission <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> of the timing signal by the second network device <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> will offer similar results. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, it may be seen that the present invention offers the possibility of hybridization between disparate systems. Shown is a subscriber device <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> capable of transmitting to network devices <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and receiving from a network device <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, depicted as a GPS satellite. In this arrangement, the differences in the arrival times of the timing signal at network devices <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> establishes a hyperbolic locus <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> as in the prior art. However, the timing signal is transmitted responsively to a synchronization signal from the network device <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> as described in the present invention. It is assumed that the network devices <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> know the timing of the synchronization signal, for instance in the manner described in the discussion of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. Thus, the present invention defines a first elliptical locus <highlight><bold>650</bold></highlight> from the sum of the distance <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> from the network device <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> to the target device <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and the distance <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> from the target device <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> to the network device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, as well as a second elliptical locus <highlight><bold>660</bold></highlight> from the sum of the distance <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> from the network device <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> to the target device <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and the distance <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> from the target device <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> to the network device <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. It is clear that this information results in improved vertical accuracy compared to that which would be provided by either system working alone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been described in conjunction with specific embodiments thereof, additional advantages and modifications will readily occur to those skilled in the art of location systems. The invention, in its broader aspects, is therefore not limited to the specific details, representative apparatus, and illustrative examples shown and described. Various alterations, modifications and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art of location systems in light of the foregoing description. These may include, but are certainly not limited to, application of the present invention to other implementations of location systems, as well as combination of the present invention with other location techniques such as AOA, RSSI, and ranging. Thus, it should be understood that the invention is not limited by the foregoing description, but embraces all such alterations, modifications and variations in accordance with the spirit and scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
