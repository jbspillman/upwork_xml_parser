<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, therein is illustrated a confectionary display device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> that is adapted to relay edible messages to the intended recipient. Device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which is generally polygonal in shape and is relatively planar in nature in one preferred embodiment, however it is to be understood that member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be circular or any other desired shape. Member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is adapted to receive at least an indicia <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> thereon, but preferably receives a plurality of indicia <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, to communicate a message or display an arrangement to the intended recipient. Now also referring <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, indicia <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be, by way of illustration but not limitation, letters of an alphabet, numerals, characters, caricatures, symbols, signs, and emblems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Now also referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, a cross-sectional view of the member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the indicia <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, both affixed thereto and independent thereof, is presented. Member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is preferably made of a hard candy substance having an outer shell <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> that is hard in nature. However, member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may have an inner substance <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which may either be soft or hard confectionary that is enclosed within the hard outer shell <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In one preferred embodiment, member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be a white candy stick that is similar to the LIK-UM-AID&reg; or WONKA&reg; products that are sold under the &ldquo;FUN DIP&rdquo; brand, wherein the white candy stick is dipped into a powder based confectionary which adheres thereto and is consumed. The white candy stick thereof may be adapted into a tablet form such as member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to allow the adherence of indicia <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> thereto in a substantially secure, yet possibly removable, manner. In an alternate preferred embodiment, the member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be similar to M&amp;M&apos;s&reg; candies, which are available through Mars, Inc., with a chocolate filling and a hard outer shell adapted to be of sufficient size to accommodate the adherence of indicia <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Indicia <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be selected from a variety of confectionary products that are presently known in the art. For purposes of illustration, but not limitation, indicia <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be hard candies such as the JOLLY RANCHERS&reg; candies which are available from Hershey Foods, Inc. The hard candies may be moistened with water which makes the hard candies sticky, thereby allowing adherence thereof directly to member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Another confectionary which may also be moistened for adherence to member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are jelly gum confectionary, such as the classic gum drop, or GUMMI BEARS available from Harmony Snacks, Inc. or any taffy style confectionary. The gels in these confections are firm and have ample resiliency for shape retention when marketed in stacked bags or in bulk. However, the eating qualities of the gel are desirably a soft tender bite and moderately quick dissolving when chewed. A second type of gel confection is jubes or hard gums produced from the same primary gel ingredients as sugared jellies, but lower in moisture content and generally containing additional starch. All of these confections have in common, firm, resilient gel structure which become tacky when moistened with water and securely adhere to member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Indicia <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may also be made of candies having a hard outer covering <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> or a shell as described above, wherein a center filling such as starch jelly centers or chocolate centers are coated with a sugar shell. For indicia <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> that have a hard outer covering <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, an adhesive means <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is utilized to attach the indicia <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Adhesive means <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be selected from any known edible tacky or sticky substance that is known in the art which is used in the food preparation industry. For purposes of illustration, but not limitation, in one preferred embodiment, the adhesive means <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be made by combining a quarter of a cup of powdered sugar with two tablespoons of light syrup and a pinch of baking powder. The ingredients are mixed together until a pasty liquid is obtained and can be applied to indicia <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Over time, the pasty liquid becomes solidified and has bonding capability. Indicia <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> having adhesive means <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is then attached to member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> wherein the adhesive means <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> hardens and securely attaches indicia <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Now referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> supporting means <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is provided for preferably storing indicia <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> that require an adhesive means <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> for attachment to member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Supporting means <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, for purposes of illustration, but not limitation, may be an elongated sheet of wax paper such that the adhesive means <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> attaches thereto in a secure yet removable fashion. Furthermore, the wax paper allows the adhesive means <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to remain tacky thereby facilitating the attachment thereof to member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Now referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6, a</cross-reference> storing means <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is provided for preferably storing indicia <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> that do not have an adhesive means <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> therewith and also for storing a plurality of members <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Storing means <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> preferably has a first compartment <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> that is adapted to accommodate a plurality of members <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Storing means <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> also has a second compartment <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for accommodating a plurality of indicia <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Second compartment <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may also be divided into a plurality of sub-compartments by at least a dividing means <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, such that varying indicia <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be grouped together in the sub-compartments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> While the above description contains many specificities, these should not be construed as limitations on the scope of the invention, but rather as an exemplification of preferred embodiments thereof. Many other variations are possible without departing from the essential spirit of this invention. Accordingly, the scope of the invention should be determined not by the embodiments illustrated, but by the appended claims and their legal equivalents. </paragraph>
