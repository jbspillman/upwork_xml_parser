<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to aeration devices and, more particularly is concerned with an aeration system for preventing the growth of marine organisms on underwater structures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It is known in the art that marine organisms will not grow on underwater structures if the water around the structure is in motion. A patent search has found no prior art useful for this purpose. However, the search did reveal an aeration device as described below. However, this prior art device does not disclose the unique features of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In U.S. Pat. No. 3,814,399, dated Jun. 4, 1974, Melreit disclosed a device for aerating water in a bathtub by a flow of heated air supplied to the device from a remote source. The device comprises a generally oval flat bottom base with a top section permanently attached thereto. The top section is formed with an inverted outer U-shaped channel extending around the periphery of the top section and forming an air passage with the base. Another similarly shaped central channel extends from one end of the top section longitudinally along the top section forming another air passage. The channels are supplied with the heated air under pressure through a connected base, and the air then flows into the water through a plurality of spaced holes formed in the channels. An opening is formed in the outer channel to provide access into both outer and central channels for cleaning. A slip collar is mounted on the supply air hose coupling to permit regulation of the amount of water aeration. A seat is formed integrally on the top section to provide a conformable area upon which the bather may sit when using the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> While this aeration system may be suitable for the purposes for which they were designed, they would not be as suitable for the purposes of the present invention, as hereinafter described. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> It is known in the art that underwater marine organisms will not grow on structures which are located in flowing or moving water. The aeration effect achieved by the present invention creates a water environment which is in constant movement thereby providing constant movement about the underwater structures being a piling or boat hull or the like which prevents marine organisms from growing on the underwater structure or boat hull. The present invention will also have a positive effect on the environment by reducing the use of toxic boat hull paints which are now in wide use and which are now used to prevent the growth of underwater marine organisms such as barnacles or the like. These paints are currently used on boat hulls as well as other underwater structures. Wide spread use of the present invention might include, for example, an entire boat marina having all boat slips connected up to a single large capacity air supply with a separate air valve being used to supply air to each boat slip whereby the boat user can simply turn his individual boat slip air supply off when the boat is not in its slip. Many other adaptations of the present invention will be accomplished by one skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
