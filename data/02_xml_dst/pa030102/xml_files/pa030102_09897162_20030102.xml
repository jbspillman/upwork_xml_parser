<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The described subject matter pertains to context sensitive help. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A substantially important element of a user-friendly computer program application is readily available &ldquo;help&rdquo; information. Most computer programs provide some form of help information such as a help menu item in a main user interface (UI) window and/or context-sensitive help. Responsive to a user selecting a help menu item, an operating system (OS) typically sends a computer program a particular message indicating to the computer program that the user selected the menu item, causing at least one help window to be displayed. The displayed help window includes help information such as a list of help topics, an index, an introduction to the computer program, and/or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> To locate information corresponding to a user&apos;s help request (e.g., information to resolve a question, solve a perceived problem, etc.), the user must typically scroll through displayed help topics or an index, perform a keyword search, type in a natural language question, and/or the like. By doing this, the user leaves the context of the computer program within which the user is working to locate the help information in the displayed help window. After the user has read the displayed help, the user typically closes the help window to return to the computer program application within which the user was previously working. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A goal of context-sensitive help is to provide a user with help information without requiring the user to leave the context of the computer program within which the user is working. Responsive to a user action such as a right-button mouse click over a displayed UI object, context-sensitive help typically provides immediate context-sensitive information about the object without requiring the user to perform additional actions such as performing a keyword search in a separate window to locate desired information as described above. (Such UI objects can be any type of object such as a label, a control such as a button or a scroll bar in a property sheet or a dialog box, a window, and the like). The provided context-sensitive help generally answers context-sensitive questions with respect to the object of interest such as &ldquo;What is this object&quest;&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Why would I use this object&quest;&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Conventional context-sensitive help implementations are limited in that a computer program that displays one or more UI objects, can not typically display context-sensitive help corresponding to the displayed objects unless the program was designed in advance to display context-sensitive help. This generally means that a software developer must have already mapped a respective unique ID to each UI object for which the program desires to provide such help. These unique IDs in turn must have already been mapped to one or more corresponding help files that include corresponding context-sensitive help information for the UI objects. Thus, a computer program generally cannot provide context-sensitive help for a UI that the program knows nothing about, regardless of whether the UI is being displayed, or rendered by the computer program. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> To illustrate this, consider that a network-based product such as a server appliance communicates its Web-based UI (e.g., a number of HTML files that describe one or more Web pages) over a network for subsequent display by a different computer. In this example, the server appliance&apos;s UI allows a user to manage data storage devices such as respective disk drives and/or logical storage volumes. Responsive to receiving the server appliance&apos;s UI, a Web browser such as Microsoft Internet Explorer&reg; that is executing on the different computer displays the communicated server appliance&apos;s Web page. In this example, the server appliance and the browser that is displaying the appliance&apos;s Web-based UI are executing on separate computers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Unfortunately, unless the browser that is displaying the UI was pre-programmed to display context-sensitive help corresponding to specifics of the server appliance&apos;s Web-based UI, context-sensitive help is not generally available to a user viewing such a UI. This is because the browser rendering the Web-based UI does not know about the context of the server appliance&apos;s UI. The browser only knows about its own UI. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In this example, if a user that is viewing the server&apos;s UI does not know the difference between managing disks and volumes, the user will not generally be able to obtain any context-sensitive help to describe the difference. Instead, if the user selects a help menu item or help button displayed in the browser&apos;s UI, the user will be presented with help information that corresponds to the browser. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The following subject matter addresses these and other problems of traditional help implementations, which do not provide for the display of Web based-UI context-sensitive help. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A context sensitive help system <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> for a Web-based UI may be described in the general context of computer-executable instructions, such as program modules, being executed by a computer. Generally, program modules include routines, programs, objects, components, data structures, etc. that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. An exemplary context sensitive help system for a Web-based UI may also be practiced in distributed computing environments where tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a communications network. In a distributed computing environment, program modules may be located in both local and remote computer storage media including memory storage devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the computing environment <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> includes a general-purpose computing device in the form of a computer <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. In one implementation, the computing device <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is a server appliance. A server appliance is a server does not require, for example, a monitor, a mouse or keyboard, and/or other interface peripherals. The server appliance may have one or more sets of well-defined functions such as a file server, an e-mail server, a data storage device, etc. The server appliance provides context-sensitive help for the appliance&apos;s Web-based UI. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The components of computer <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may include, by are not limited to, one or more processors or processing units <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, a system memory <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, and a bus <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> that couples various system components including the system memory <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> to the processor <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. Bus <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> represents one or more of any of several types of bus structures, including a memory bus or memory controller, a peripheral bus, an accelerated graphics port, and a processor or local bus using any of a variety of bus architectures. Such architectures include, for example, Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) bus, Micro Channel Architecture (MCA) bus, Enhanced ISA (EISA) bus, Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) local bus, and Peripheral Component Interconnects (PCI) bus also known as Mezzanine bus. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Exemplary Server Appliance Web-Based UI </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a block diagram that shows an exemplary server appliance&apos;s Web-based UI <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to provide a user that is viewing the Web-based UI on a device other than the server appliance with context-sensitive help corresponding to the Web-based UI. Web page <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may be only a portion of the Web-based UI. In other words, the Web-based UI may include any number of Web pages for presentation on a different computer than the server appliance computer. A user of the different computer interacts with the Web-based UI to remotely manage the server appliance, review information corresponding to the server appliance, and/or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The types/functions of various server appliance implementations are virtually unlimited. Thus, depending on the function of a particular server appliance, the information and/or function provided by an appliance&apos;s Web-based UI will vary accordingly. However, for purposes of this example, the Web page <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> illustrates information and function of a server appliance that is used for managing a data storage device. The Web-based UI&apos;s Web page <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> provides a user with context-sensitive help corresponding to the Web page. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The Web page <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> includes a menu bar <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, menu items <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>, a persistent help object <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, and a working area <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. The menu items provide a user with direct access to information and/or functionality that corresponds to a data storage device server appliance. Such menu items include hypertext links to direct a user to a particular Web page of the Web-based UI or function of the appliance with only a click of the mouse on either an image or word. Thus, the server appliance&apos;s framework determines both the look-and-feel of the Web page, as well as the appliance&apos;s response to user selection of a particular menu item. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Working area <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> presents information and functionality that corresponds to the server appliance. In this example, both because the server appliance is a data storage device and because the &ldquo;Disks and Volumes&rdquo; menu item <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is selected (also note the presence of sub-menu items <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>), the working area includes information corresponding to &ldquo;Disks and Volumes&rdquo;. This is further illustrated by the &ldquo;Disks and Volumes&rdquo; label <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and various links <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. In this implementation the links are hypertext links that responsive to user selection request the appliance to: (a) present a different Web page of its remote UI; (b) perform a particular function; (c) and/or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The persistent help object <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> provides access to context-sensitive help that is associated with the Web page <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The help object can be any object such as a hypertext link, a bitmap image of question mark representation (as illustrated in this example), and the like. In this implementation, the persistent help object is displayed in the menu bar <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. However, the help object can be displayed anywhere in the Web page. The persistent object <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is mapped to a Universal Resource Locator (URL) that identifies the network address of the server appliance that communicated the Web page <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> for display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The URL behind the help object <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> further specifies a number of additional parameters such as the displayed Web page&apos;s <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> unique ID. Each Web page <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of a server appliance&apos;s Web-based UI comprises a unique ID&mdash;meaning that a Web page&apos;s ID is unique with respect to all other Web page IDs within the appliance&apos;s UI framework. A Web page&apos;s unique ID is used to identify the Web page&apos;s corresponding context-sensitive help. (Systems, procedures, and data structures that use a unique ID to identify associated context sensitive help are discussed in greater detail below in reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> A Web-based UI <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can have many different features other than those described with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. For example, a different Web page <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may include an audio presentation of a Web-based UI, wherein a user can select context-sensitive help corresponding to the Web page with an utterance that is recognizable by voice recognition software. Moreover, the different Web page may comprise one or more of a combination of aspects such as the menu bar <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, the work area <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, and/or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a block diagram that shows a Web browser <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> that is executing on a different computer than a server appliance. The Web browser has received the server appliance&apos;s Web-based UI such as the Web-based UI/Web page <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, and renders it. The rendered remote UI provides a user of the server appliance with context-sensitive help for the appliance&apos;s Web-based UI. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The browser <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> includes a title bar <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, a button bar <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, an address bar <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, a display region for rendering a Web page <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of a server appliance&apos;s Web-based UI <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, and a status bar <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. The Web browser UI is typically customizable by a user to present one of a number of possible UIs portions. Thus, a Web browser may have more or less features than the features <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, as long as the Web browser can present a Web page such as the server appliance&apos;s Web-based UI. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The title bar <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> includes menu items such as a help menu item. (Individual menu items are not shown). The button bar <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> includes a number of buttons corresponding to the functionality of the Web browser <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> such as a help button <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. The address bar <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> provides a region to edit and display a text representation of a particular Web-site address such as a URL address. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In this example, a user has selected a &ldquo;Disks and Volumes&rdquo; Web page, which is part of a server appliance&apos;s remote, or Web-based UI <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. This is illustrated by a selected menu-item <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, label <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, and links <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, each of which is rendered in the browser&apos;s rendering area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Exemplary System to Provide Context-Sensitive Help for a Web-Based UI </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a block diagram that shows an exemplary portion of system memory <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> of a server appliance <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Program Data <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> includes data <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> comprising the server appliance&apos;s Web-based UI. Such data includes data for one or more Web pages such as Web Page <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The program data also comprises one or more Web page mapping tables <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> and an optional set of help files <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> A Web page mapping table <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight>, maps unique IDs to respective Web Pages of the remote, or Web based UI of the server appliance. The server appliance utilizes a Web page&apos;s unique ID to identify the Web page&apos;s corresponding context-sensitive help information To accomplish this, a Web page&apos;s unique ID identifies either: (a) one or more specific help files such one or more specific Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) files that contain the Web page&apos;s particular context sensitive help topic(s); or, (b) other information that is used to identify a help data source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In one implementation, a help data source includes, for example, a URL that identifies a networked device that stores help data. Because it is not necessary for help data to be hardwired into the mapping table <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight>, a referenced help data source can be modified, moved to a different location, and/or renamed as necessary. Moreover, because the mapping table can be used to map a source of help information to a device other than a server appliance <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and/or independent hardware vendors (IHVs) of the server appliance are not required to take up the server appliance&apos;s limited memory resources to help data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In one implementation, the mapping table <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> identifies a default set of help data. If the default set of help data is not accessible, the table identifies alternative help data and/or one or more alternative help data sources. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The help files <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> include context sensitive help information corresponding to one or more Web pages of the server appliance&apos;s <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> Web-based UI. As discussed above, it is not necessary for the help files to be stored on the server appliance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The application programs <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> include server appliance specific modules <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, embedded Web server <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>, and dynamic content generator(s) <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>. The appliance specific modules comprise one or more computer program applications to perform the single function or set of well-defined functions of the appliance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The embedded web server <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> both communicates a Web page to one or more other computers on a network and receives requests from the one or more computers on the network. (Procedures to use an embedded Web server to communicate, or &ldquo;serve&rdquo; a Web page and to receive requests from other computers are well-known to those skilled in the arts of computer programming and network software). Specifically, the embedded Web server communicates the server appliance&apos;s <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> data comprising a Web-based UI <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> to another computer. Requests for context-sensitive help corresponding to respective Web pages in the appliance&apos;s Web-based UI are received at one or more predetermined Universal Resource Locators (URLs). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The dynamic content generator program module(s) <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> comprises one or more computer programs that implement a server-side scripting interface to generate dynamic content including context-sensitive help for the server appliance&apos;s <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> Web-based UI. Such server-side scripting interfaces include, for example, Common Gateway Interface (CGI) and an Internet Server Application Program Interface (ISAPI), both of which are well known to those skilled in the art of computer programming. CGI is a broad category that includes all possible programming models that can be used to implement server-side scripting, including all computer program languages that can be used to generate computer-executable instructions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> To dynamically generate context-sensitive help for a particular Web page, a dynamic content generator <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> performs one or more of a combination of: (a) identifying a source of the particular Web page&apos;s corresponding help information; (b) retrieving the help information from the identified source; (c) performing any modifications to the retrieved help such that it will be compatible with one or more platforms of a computer (e.g., an operating system or a Web browser platform, a preferred language such as English or French, etc.) that sent the request for the context-sensitive help; and (d) performing any other modifications to the retrieved help based on other criteria (if any) that may effect the type and/level of context sensitive help that will be presented to a user. Such other criteria may be based on the intended use of the computer, based on predetermined user preferences, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> For example, a server appliance intended for use in a residential setting may also use predetermined preferences of users (e.g., a user&apos;s age) to generate the appropriate help content for the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> To modify help information to be compatible with a particular platform of a computer that is going to present the appliance&apos;s Web based UI, a set of parameter information is mapped to a URL that in turn is mapped to the persistent help object <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Such parameter information includes, for example: (a) a hardware platform indication; (b) an operating system indication such as Microsoft WINDOWS&reg;, Linux, and the like; (c) a Web browser type indication such as a Microsoft Internet Explorer&reg;, Netscape Navigator&reg;, and the like; (d) software version information; or (e) a preferred language. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> For example, if a particular Web browser does not display HTML, dynamic content generator program <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> converts the identified help information into some other preferred presentation format such as speech output. The server appliance may be coupled to various help files language sets such as English help files, Japanese help files, French help files, etc. The referenced program knows which language is being used on the computer that is presenting a server appliance&apos;s Web-based UI, and determines the correct help file to present to a user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In one implementation, the dynamic content generator program modules are modules within the embedded web server <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Exemplary Procedure to Provide Context-Sensitive Help for a Web-Based UI </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a flowchart diagram that shows an exemplary procedure <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> to provide context-sensitive help for a server appliance&apos;s Web-based UI. At block <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, a server appliance communicates a Web page of a Web-based UI to a different computer that is coupled to the server appliance over a network. At block <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>, the server appliance receives a request for context-sensitive help from the different computer that corresponds to the communicated Web-based UI (block <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>). Such a request is made by user selection of a help object <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. (In this implementation, the help object is mapped to a URL that identifies a network address of the server appliance). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> At block <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>, responsive to receiving the request for context-sensitive help (block <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>), the server appliance determines context sensitive information corresponding to the communicated Web-based UI (block <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>). At block <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>, the procedure generates a Web page that includes the determined context-sensitive help information (block <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>). At block <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, the server appliance communicates the context-sensitive help as another Web page to the different computer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Thus, in contrast to conventional Web-based UIs, which do not provide context sensitive help to a user, procedure <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> provides context-sensitive help for a Web-based UI, regardless of which type of computer, OS, Web browser, or language is used by a computer when presenting the Web-based UI. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Although details of various implementations are described above, such details are intended to satisfy statutory disclosure obligations rather than to limit the scope of the following claims. Thus, the subject matter as defined by the claims is not limited to the specific features described above. Rather, the subject matter is claimed in any of its forms or modifications that fall within the proper scope of the appended claims, appropriately interpreted in accordance with the doctrine of equivalents. </paragraph>
