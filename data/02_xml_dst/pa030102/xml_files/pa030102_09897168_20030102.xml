<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to hockey sticks or like-game sticks. More specifically, the present invention is concerned with a core for blade of a hockey or like-game stick and a method for making a blade having such a core. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Hockey is a widely popular sport. Conventional hockey sticks and like-game sticks include a blade and a shaft. The conventional manufacture process for such sticks involves a large number of individual operations. The separate steps include cutting, planning, sanding, laminating, tapering, fitting, bonding and finishing of the various pieces that make up the sticks. This process is very labour intensive and costly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Blade structures using interior cores are well known in the art. Such blades include an interior core which has opposed side surfaces joined with a pair of reinforced plastic layers, the length and height of which are substantially equal to the length and height of the entire finished blade. These reinforced plastic layers are laminated onto the core and are themselves covered by protective layers of wood veneers or equivalent materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Examples of such blade structure are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,013,288; 4,124,208 and 4,488,721; and in Canadian patents nos 1,047,561; 1,188,343; 1,183,883; 2,228,104 and 2,244,601. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A drawback of the prior art hockey stick blade and method for making same is the manufacturing time in making the blade. Another drawback is the fact that the interior core can only be used to make a specifically shaped blade since it dictates the finished blade dimensions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It thus remains a need to provide a faster and less costly method for making blades mountable in a shaft of a hockey or like-game stick. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The general object of the present invention is therefore to provide an improved blade for a hockey or like-game stick and method for making same. </paragraph>
</section>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> With reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the appended drawings, a first preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows an exploded view of a blade <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, to be mounted to a tubular hockey shaft <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or like-game stick. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The blade <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a preformed core <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, a shaft receiving member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and first and second preformed skins <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. It is to be understood that the terms &ldquo;first&rdquo; and &ldquo;second&rdquo; are used herein only for convenience and hence, are interchangeable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The core <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is shown having distal and proximate ends <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, top and bottom edge portions <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and first and second opposite lateral faces <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 3</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>). Again, the terms &ldquo;first&rdquo; and &ldquo;second&rdquo; are interchangeable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The top edge portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is tapered, the reason for which will be described hereinbelow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Generally stated, the proximate end <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is configured and sized to receive the shaft receiving member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the first and second lateral faces <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are configured and sized to respectively receive the first and second preformed skins <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> At least one of the first and second faces <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> may include cavities <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. In the example shown here, it is the first face <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> which includes the cavities <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. As will easily be understood by one skilled in the art, the cavities <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are advantageously provided on the face that is on the reverse side of the blade, i.e. the side less used for forceful shots by the hockey player. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The shaft receiving member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is shown including upper and lower portions <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and first and second opposite lateral sides <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The upper portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is configured and sized to be conventionally mounted to the hollow shaft <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the upper portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is smaller in dimension than the lower portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> such that lower portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> forms a shoulder <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The hollow shaft <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has a lower section <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> that is mountable to the upper portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of the shaft receiving member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The lower portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is configured and sized to be mounted to the proximate end <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the core <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> as will be described hereinafter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> More specifically, the proximate end <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the core <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> includes a recess <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> corresponding to the shape of the lower portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the shaft receiving member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> so as to be engaged thereby in a complementary fit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Keeping the above in mind, a hockey stick blade <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention is made as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The blade <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is constructed by first making a preformed core <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the type described above and having a size that is smaller than that of the finished blade <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Preferably, this preformed core <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is made of a single piece of wear-resistant material such as plastic. It is advantageous to use materials that are both strong enough to withstand the impact of a hockey puck and the like yet, light enough so that the user may easily manipulate the stick. Furthermore, as illustrated in the appended Figures, the bottom edge portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> or the core <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be in contact with the playing surface when the stick is used, hence the use of wear resistant material to manufacture the core <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the core <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is made of thermosetting plastic reinforced with high modulus fibres such as glass, carbon or kevlar fibres. Conventionally, some blades <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are curved such as those mounted to ice-hockey sticks and hence, have a concave or puck-hitting side. In this respect, it may be convenient to make the core <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> with a corresponding curvature. Conversely, the core may be made straight and curved during the skins gluing steps described hereinbelow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> As aforementioned, at least one of the first and second faces <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> may include cavities <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. In this way, the core <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> will be made using the least material possible and hence, will have the minimum possible impact on the overall weight of the blade <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The shaft receiving member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be made out of the same wear-resistant material as core <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, out of wood or out of any other suitable material. The shaft receiving member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is then mounted to the core <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Specifically, an adhesive is provided between the lower portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the complementary recess <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the core proximate end <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. In this way, the first face <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of core <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the first side <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are in the same lateral plane (hereinafter &ldquo;first lateral plane&rdquo;) while the second face <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of core <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the second side <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are in the same lateral plane (hereinafter &ldquo;second lateral plane&rdquo;). The adhesive may be for example an epoxy-based adhesive, a vinyl-ester-based adhesive, a polyurethane-based adhesive or a metacrylate-based adhesive, when the core <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is made of thermosetting plastic and the shaft receiving member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is made of wood. Of course, other suitable ways of mounting the shaft receiving member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to the core <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may also be contemplated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> One skilled in the art will understand that the core <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the shaft receiving member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> could be made of the same material and hence could be a single piece. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The first and second preformed skins <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be made by a variety of known ways. Preferably and with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the preformed skins <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are pre-cut out of a sheet of material <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> which will be described in details hereinafter. Skins <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be cut by a variety of ways known in the art such as with a die cutter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> With particular reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 2</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the first skin <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is mounted to both the first face <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of core <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and to the first side <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> while the second skin <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is mounted to the second face <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of core <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the second side <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Preferably skins <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are mounted to the core <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and to the member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> via an adhesive applied to their respective inner sides <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. The adhesive may be an epoxy-based adhesive, a vinyl-ester-based adhesive, a polyurethane-based adhesive or a metacrylate-based adhesive, for example. In this way, the shaft receiving member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is securely mounted to the core <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> both by the adhesive provided between its lower portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the recess <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the core <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and by the skins <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> With reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, it is to be noted that the core is so dimensioned in height that when the first and second skins <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are mounted to the first and second faces <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> as explained above, the skins <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> meet over the tapered top edge portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Specifically, the top parts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the skins <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> meet and adhere to one another via an adhesive such as that used to attach the skins <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to the core <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and to member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. This is an advantage since it provides a blade <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having a top portion that is very thin which is a desired feature in hockey stick blades. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The top edges <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of the skins <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> form the top edge <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of the blade <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>; the bottom edges <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of skins <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the bottom edge <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the core <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> form the bottom edge <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of the blade ; and the distal end <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the core <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and the distal ends <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of the skins <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> form the distal end <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of blade <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the core <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is advantageously so dimensioned that the shape of the blade <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is defined by the shape of the first and second preformed skins <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Hence, the same core <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be used for a variety of blades shaped in different manners. A particular blade shape may be selected on the basis of the shape of the skins <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Hence, the skins <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> as preformed according to the desired final shape of the blade <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the length of the core <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the blade <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be substantially similar. However, the height of core <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is smaller than that of the blade. As discussed hereinabove, the top edge portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the core <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is tapered to yield a pointed top edge. This is an advantageous feature since it allows the top skins <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to meet without creating a significative void in the top edge portion thereof. Indeed, such a void would either fill with adhesive, which would unnecessarily make the blade heavier, or would stay void and create a frail spot in the blade. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The skins <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be made of a variety of materials. In the preferred embodiment of FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the skins <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are made of high modulus fibre such as glass, carbon and/or kevlar fibres in a rigid binding resin. The skins <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> could also be made of thin strip reinforcement of parallel axial high modulus fibres in a matrix of thermoset resin, for example. Of course other suitable materials for making skins <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> such as, for example, high quality wood veneer and acrylonitrile/butadiene/styrene plastic (ABS plastic) may also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Turning now more specifically to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> of the appended drawings, the skins <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are also configured to receive a protective layer <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> thereon. This protective layer <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> may cover the whole blade <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with the exception of the distal end <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> if so desired. The protective layer <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> may advantageously be made of a reinforcing high modulus light weight fabric. Preferably, the protective layer <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is made of fiberglass woven textile within a matrix of plastic material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Turning now briefly to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> of the appended drawings, a blade <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> will be described. The major difference between the blade <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and the blade <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> concerns the skin <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> which is made of wood instead of the fibre making the skin <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as discussed hereinabove. This illustrates that the two skins are not necessarily made of the same material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, which is very similar to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, illustrates a blade <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> where both the first and second skins <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> are made of wood veneer and are covered by a protective layer <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> advantageously made of a reinforcing high modulus light weight fabric. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, which illustrates, in a sectional view similar to that of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> blade <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention, each of preformed skins <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> includes superimposed outer and inner layers. More specifically, each skin <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is provided with respective inner wood veneer layers <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> and outer fibre layers <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. As previously mentioned, other types of materials can be used to make the layers. Outer and inner layers are advantageously mounted to the core <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> by means of an adhesive such as for example an epoxy-based adhesive, a vinyl-ester-based adhesive, a polyurethane-based adhesive or a metacrylate-based adhesive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated to one skilled in the art that the various blades <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and described hereinabove, are all provided with a shaft receiving member that is so configured and sized to conventionally mount the blade to a hollow shaft. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> of the appended drawings illustrates a hockey stick <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> provided with a blade <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> manufactured according to an aspect of the present invention and integrally mounted to the shaft <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> of the hockey stick. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> As will be understood by one skilled in the art, the blade end of the shaft <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> is shaped as the lower portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) to be mounted to the recess <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the core <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The two skins <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> (only one shown) are then secured to the core <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and to the blade end of the shaft <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> It will therefore be understood that the term &ldquo;shaft&rdquo; used herein and in the appended claims should be construed as meaning an actual shaft <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> or a shaft receiving member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> or any variation thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> It is also within the scope of the present invention to provide a blade core assembly (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) which includes the preformed core <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the shaft receiving member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which are pre-assembled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> It is to be understood that even though the appended drawings illustrate regular player&apos;s hockey stick, the present invention could be used to construct a goalkeeper hockey stick. The terms &ldquo;hockey stick&rdquo; and &ldquo;blade&rdquo; being generically used herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> It is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and parts illustrated in the accompanying drawings and described hereinabove. The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practised in various ways. It is also to be understood that the phraseology or terminology used herein is for the purpose of description and not limitation.
