<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to microelectronic device fabrication. More particularly, the present invention relates to fabrication of a microelectronic storage device.

<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In the microelectronics field, continual pressure exists to find faster, denser, and more cost-effective solutions to data storage. Whether the data storage is fast, on-die storage such as static random access memory (SRAM), whether it is the somewhat slower embedded dynamic random access memory (eDRAM), the even slower off-die dynamic random access memory (DRAM), or whether it is magnetic- or magneto optical disks for mass storage, each technology is constantly being advanced to meet the demand for increased speed and capacity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It was discovered that some polymers exhibit ferromagnetism. One such polymer is poly vinylidene fluoride (PVDF, whose repeat formula is (CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-CF<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>) and some of its copolymers. Another continual pressure that exists is lower energy requirements for nonvolatile data storage, particularly for mobile platform data storage that may use storage media such as flash memory or disk drives. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a ferroelectric polymer storage device including a ferroelectric polymer structure that is sandwiched between an array of electrodes that achieve electrical signaling across the ferroelectric polymer structure. With the knowledge of the ferromagnetic qualities of such polymers, the inventors ventured to take advantage of the ability to orient ferromagnetic polymer molecules as a data storage device. A careful design may be accomplished by choosing preferred interfacial layers. This may significantly improve non-volatile memory reliability and storage performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The ferroelectric polymer storage device may be referred to as a cross-point matrix polymer memory structure. Because of the mechanical- and thermal-sensitive nature of the ferroelectric polymer composition embodiments, the present invention addresses surface engineering solutions for the polymer memory structures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The cross-point matrix polymer memory structure may comprise a first electrode. A protective film may be disposed upon the first electrode. A ferroelectric polymer structure is disposed over the protective film and the substrate. A second electrode and a second protective film are disposed in a cross-layout configuration to the first electrode and the first protective film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The following description includes terms, such as upper, lower, first, second, etc. that are used for descriptive purposes only and are not to be construed as limiting. The embodiments of an apparatus or article of the present invention described herein can be manufactured, used, or shipped in a number of positions and orientations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Reference will now be made to the drawings wherein like structures will be provided with like reference designations. In order to show the structures of the present invention most clearly, the drawings included herein are diagrammatic representations of integrated circuit structures. Thus, the actual appearance of the fabricated structures, for example in a photomicrograph, may appear different while still incorporating the essential structures of the present invention. Moreover, the drawings show only the structures necessary to understand the present invention. Additional structures known in the art have not been included to maintain the clarity of the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is an elevational cross-section illustration of a memory structure <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> during fabrication of a ferroelectric polymer (FEP) memory according to one embodiment. A substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is depicted as being patterned with a mask <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and a recess <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has been formed in substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> through mask <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Recess <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is prepared to accept a first or lower electrode <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. First electrode <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be formed by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of any material that is suitable as an electrical conductor according to electrical conductors known in the art. In one embodiment, first electrode <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is an aluminum material. In one embodiment, first electrode <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is a copper or copper alloy material. The thickness of the first electrode <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> (and the second electrode <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) may depend upon the specific lithography and design rules. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> also illustrates extraneous electrode material <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>&prime; above and on mask <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, both of which will be removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, a self-aligned structure may be formed by initially depositing first electrode <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> by physical vapor deposition (PVD) as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. First electrode <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be made of any material that is suitable as an electrical conductor according to what is known in the art. First electrode <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, when formed by PVD, may be carried out in a collimated fashion to achieve little or no contact with the sidewalls <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> above an upper surface of first electrode <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in recess <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. A collimated PVD will resist contact of electrode material with sidewalls <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> above the upper surface of what is deposited if the aspect ratio of the collimator is set to match or exceed the aspect ratio of recess <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Mask <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may remain in place for both patterning of recess <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and for forming first electrode <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> on substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. After PVD of first electrode <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, mask <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be removed according to known techniques such as wet stripping or such as ashing the mask and rinsing the substrate. Accordingly, extraneous electrode material <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>&prime; depicted upon mask <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, is removed with the mask removal technique. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates the memory structure <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> after further processing to form a self-aligned electrode structure. A protective layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is formed over substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and first electrode <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Protective layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be formed by CVD or PVD in order to achieve contact at sidewalls <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of recess <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. CVD and PVD conditions are known in the art, and are often dictated by the specific application, the materials to be deposited, and the thermal budget of the article being manufactured. In one embodiment, atomic layer chemical vapor deposition (ALCVD), according to known technique, is used to from protective layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Protective layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be a metal, a refractory metal, or a metal or refractory metal alloy. Additionally, protective layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be a nitride, oxide, or carbide of the metal, refractory metal, or alloy thereof. Further, combinations of the above may be selected such as a composite protective layer. One embodiment of protective layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> includes a titanium nitride layer. Another embodiment includes a titanium oxide layer. Further details of protective layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, as to materials embodiments, are set forth herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates the memory structure <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> after further processing. Protective layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> has been reduced in vertical profile to leave a first or lower protective film <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> over first electrode <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Reduction of the vertical profile may be carried out by mechanical polishing, chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP), chemical etchback, and the like. In one embodiment, CMP is employed with a chemical recipe that is selective to substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, although some reduction of the vertical profile in the Z-direction may be permitted. Accordingly, a damascene structure is formed of substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, first electrode <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and first protective film <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> First protective film <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may be made of a material selected from metals, refractory metals, their alloys, their nitrides, oxides, carbides, and combinations thereof. In one embodiment, first protective film <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may be a metal such as aluminum. In another embodiment, first protective film <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may be a refractory metal such as titanium, a refractory metal nitride such as titanium nitride (TiN), or a refractory metal oxide such as titania (TiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>), as either rutile or anatase phase. Other refractory metals may include titanium, zirconium, hafnium, and the like. Other refractory metals may include cobalt and the like. Other refractory metals may include chromium, molybdenum, tungsten, and the like. Other refractory metals may include scandium, yttrium, lanthanum, cerium, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, first protective film <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is formed by CVD, PVD, or ALCVD of TiN or TiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. First protective film <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may be in a thickness range from about 10 nanometers (nm) to about 100 nm, preferably from about 20 nm to about 50 nm. With the formation of first protective film <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, memory structure <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is prepared to receive an FEP structure over the substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates the memory structure <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> after further processing. In one embodiment, a first or lower FEP layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is formed over substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and first protective film <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> by the Langmuir-Blodgett deposition technique. The Langmuir-Blodgett (L-B) deposition technique is well known in the art. It usually comprises an ambient temperature process of dipping a substrate into a vessel containing fluid material that will precipitate onto the substrate during dipping. Thereafter, a spin-on FEP layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is formed above and on first FEP layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Spin-on FEP layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> may be formed by depositing the FEP material as a fluid in a puddle prime onto substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for a period of from about 5 to 25 seconds and spinning substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and in a rotational range from about 300 revolutions per minute (rpm) to about 6000 rpm and for a time range from about 5 seconds to about 20 seconds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Following the formation of spin-on FEP layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, a second or upper FEP layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is formed above and on spin-on FEP layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> by the L-B deposition technique. The formation of first and second FEP layers <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, respectively, represents surface engineering of spin-on FEP layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> that may reduce damage at the interface between the FEP structure <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and the first and second electrodes <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, respectively. In other words, where spin-on FEP layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> requires isolation from the electrodes in order to prevent damage, surface engineering by forming at least one of the first or second FEP layers <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, respectively, helps to achieve the preferred isolation. Additionally, the vertical thickness of FEP layers <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be selected to be in the range from about 4.5 &angst; to about 45 &angst;. One thickness embodiment is about five monolayers or about 23 &angst;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Various polymers may be used to form first and second FEP layers <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment the FEP layers <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are selected from polyvinyl and polyethylene fluorides, copolymers thereof, and combinations thereof. In another embodiment, the FEP layers <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are selected from polyvinyl and polyethylene chlorides, copolymers thereof, and combinations thereof. In another embodiment, the FEP layers <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are selected from polyacrylonitriles, copolymers thereof, and combinations thereof. In another embodiment, the FEP layers <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are selected from polyamides, copolymers thereof, and combinations thereof. Other embodiments may include combinations of the above that cross different types such as polyfluorides and polyamides or polyfluorides and polyacrylonitriles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, first and second FEP layers, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are L-B deposited polymers selected from (CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-CF<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>, (CHF-CF<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>, (CF<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-CF<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>, &agr;-, &bgr;-, &ggr;-, and &dgr;-phases thereof, preferably the &bgr;-phase, (CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-CF<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>-(CHF-CF<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>m </subscript></highlight>copolymer, &agr;-, &bgr;-, &ggr;-, and &dgr;-phases, preferably the &bgr;-phase of (CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-CF<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>-(CHF-CF<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>m </subscript></highlight>copolymer, and combinations thereof. The copolymer of (CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-CF<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>-(CHF-CF<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>m </subscript></highlight>may be referred to as P(VDF-TrFE) or poly vinylidene fluoride-triflouroethylene. In one particular embodiment, first and second FEP layers, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are a copolymer of (CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-CF<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>-(CHF-CF<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>m </subscript></highlight>wherein n and m equal 1, and wherein n is in a fraction range from about 0.6 to about 0.9, preferably from about 0.7 to about 0.8, and more preferably about 0.75. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> It may be preferable to form crystalline ferroelectric polymers of first- and second-layers <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. By &ldquo;crystalline&rdquo; it may be understood that the L-B deposition technique may form a polymer that is a highly ordered structure according to the Miller-Bravais indices lattice system or the like, wherein substantially a monolayer is initially formed. In one example, the formation of a monolayer of P(VDF-TrFE) copolymer may have a vertical profile of about 4.5 &angst;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Most polymer systems will exhibit some degree of atacticity, however, the L-B technique has achieved virtually isotactic polymer films. Where a copolymer is formed by the L-B deposition technique, the film will tend more away from isotacticity than for a monomer under similar deposition conditions. In some situations, a syndiotactic film may be formed, even where functional groups in the polymer or copolymer film are bulkier than others. By the same token, a syndiotactic copolymer is achievable under the L-B deposition technique, but the copolymer will also tend toward atacticity, depending upon whether the copolymer film forms as a random, regular, block, or graft copolymer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The crystalline structure may begin to deviate from a highly ordered (isotactic or syndiotactic) lattice configuration where several monolayers of an FEP structure are formed by the L-B deposition technique. In one embodiment, a five-monolayer structure is formed. In another embodiment, a 10-monolayer structure is formed. Accordingly, instead of a highly ordered monocrystalline lattice structure, lamellae of monolayers or monolayer groups may form with some dislocations at the lamellar interfaces. The crystalline nature of a five- or 10 monolayer structure may be compared to a hypothetical highly ordered five- or 10-monolayer structure, in a range from about 20% crystalline to about 80% crystalline. In one embodiment, the ordered amount of crystallinity (degree of isotacticity or syndiotacticity) in the FEP structure is in a range from about one-third to about two-thirds, preferably greater that about one-half of the lamellar structure up to and including about 95% crystalline. The ordered amount of the crystalline structure may be quantified by diagnostic techniques such as scanning electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, and others. Under tightly controlled operating conditions, crystallinity may be as high as about 95% for 5- and 10-monolayer structures, and structures between these monolayer numbers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The spin-on FEP layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> that is disposed between layers <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be likewise made of any of the polymers, copolymers, combinations, and ratios thereof as set forth in this disclosure. The thickness of spin-on FEP layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> may be in a range from about 500 &angst; to about 2,000 &angst;, preferably from about 600 &angst; to about 1,500 &angst;, and most preferably from about 700 &angst; to about 1,000 &angst;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> also illustrates further processing in which a second or upper protective film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and a second or upper electrode <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are formed in a configuration that may be referred to as a &ldquo;cross point&rdquo; <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> array that exposes FEP structure <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> between first electrode <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and second electrode <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. In other words, the cross point <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> or projection of the width W, of first electrode <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> upward onto second electrode <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> exposes an area of FEP structure <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> that is about equivalent to the square of width W if second electrode <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> also has a width of about width W. The amount of FEP structure <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> that is within this projected area may be most susceptible of being written to and read from as a memory element embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The cross point <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of memory structure <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may have a dimension in the X-direction that may be tied to a particular minimum-feature mask technology. For example, lithography process flows may have minimum features that are 0.25 micrometers (microns), 0.18 microns, 0.13 microns, and 0.11 microns. Other minimum features that may be accomplished in the future are applicable to the present invention. As set forth herein, the Z-direction thickness of second protective film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and second electrode <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, may match those of first protective film <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and first electrode <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates another embodiment of the present invention. In one embodiment, a single crystalline FEP layer <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> is formed by the L-B technique as is known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6, a</cross-reference> memory structure <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> includes a substrate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and a recess <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> that contains a first or lower electrode <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> disposed within sidewalls <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of recess <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> as well as a first protective film <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> disposed within the sidewalls <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of a recess <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. A single, crystalline FEP layer <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> is disposed above and on substrate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and first protective film <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. Above and on crystalline FEP layer <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> is disposed a second protective film <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, disposed above and on second protective film <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is a second or upper electrode <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. The cross point <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, defined by an area that is about the square of width W, is between first electrode <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and second electrode <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. Cross point <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> comprises a signal interface for data storage according to an embodiment. A crystalline FEP structure <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> is therefore formed out of a single FEP layer <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. The degree of crystallinity may be in a range from about 20% to about 95%, and may within this range, may preferably be more than about half. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Some advantages reside in this embodiment in comparison to a multi-layer structure such as FEP structure <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. Although a single about 4.5 &angst; thick layer, an about 45 &angst; thick layer, or twice i.e. an about 90 &angst; thick layer for that matter, may not be significantly thick enough to prevent significant damage at the polymer/electrode interface during ALCVD of second protective film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, a thicker layer may be made with additional processing time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Additional processing time may come from a trade-off for a single crystalline ferroelectric polymer layer <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> that may be thinner than ferroelectric polymer structure <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. However, the trade-off is that deposition time during a single FEP-layer formation by the L-B deposition technique may expand to include all processing time that previously was needed to form ferro electric polymer structure <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Hence the following processing times that otherwise would have been used for surface engineering a multi-layer FEP structure depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, may be employed to form crystalline FEP structure <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>: set-up, deposition, and shut-down time for first FEP layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, set-up, spin-on, cure, and shut-down time for FEP layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, and set-up, deposition, and shut-down time for second FEP layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the thickness of a single, crystalline FEP layer may be in a range from about 100 &angst; to about 2,000 &angst; or larger, subject only to the design rules of a specific application. Other thicknesses may be in a range from about 200 &angst; to about 1,500 &angst;. Other thicknesses may be in a range from about 300 &angst; to about 1,000 &angst;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, a spin-on FEP layer may also be a stand-alone FEP structure similar to what is depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> as a single, crystalline FEP structure <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. The only deviation from what is depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is that structure <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> is a spin-on layer instead of an L-B deposition layer. It may be noted that the degree of crystallinity of such a spin-on FEP structure <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> may be lower than the degree of crystallinity of crystalline FEP structure <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> formed by L-B deposition. However, it is preferred that the spin-on layer be at least half crystalline. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The thicknesses of a spin-on FEP structure <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> that may be selected may be in a range from about 300 &angst; to about 2,000 &angst; or larger. In this spin-on embodiment, surface engineering of the FEP structure may be detailed as the ALCVD formation of the first and second protective films <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, respectively, as well as the use of PVD for the second electrode <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The following discussion may be applicable to the structures depicted in both <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>. Protective films <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, or <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> are preferably formed by ALCVD according to known technique. Although a CVD of second electrode <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> is not preferred due to the physical contact- and temperature-sensitive nature of FEP structure <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>, ALCVD of protective films <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> may be carried out due to the lower processing temperatures required by ALCVD. After the formation of second protective films <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, second electrodes <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> are formed by PVD under conditions that will not substantially damage FEP structures <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates a process flow embodiment that describes fabrication of a memory cell of an FEP structure and that describes surface engineering of the FEP structure(s). A process <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> includes various process flow alternatives. First the process <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> begins by forming <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> a first electrode on a substrate. The substrate may be silicon with logic and other structures such as embedded memory. The logic and/or embedded memory may include structures such as n-doped metal oxide silicon (n-MOS), p-doped MOS (p-MOS), complementary MOS (CMOS), bipolar CMOS (BiCMOS) and others. The substrate may also be a processor that includes row and column addressing communication at a periphery. As set forth herein, the substrate may also be a fiberglass-resin (FR) type structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Upon the substrate, the inventive embodiment(s) may be arranged with contact of first and second electrodes at the periphery. After forming <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> of the first electrode, the process flow continues by forming <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight> a first protective film as set forth herein. Thereafter, the process flow may take various embodiments as set forth herein. In one embodiment, an L-B deposition <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight> of a first FEP layer is carried out. Next, a spin-on <highlight><bold>732</bold></highlight> FEP layer is formed above an on the first FEP layer. Thereafter, a second FEP layer is deposited <highlight><bold>734</bold></highlight> according to the L-B technique. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In another process flow embodiment as set forth herein, a single, crystalline L-B deposition <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight> is carried out to form the crystalline FEP layer <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> that amounts to a crystalline FEP structure <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. L-B deposition, although it may be slower than spin-on deposition to achieve a preferred thickness, may form from one to about 1,000 layers or more. In another process flow embodiment as set forth herein, a single spin-on <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight> FEP layer is formed that amounts to an FEP structure as set forth herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> After the formation of an FEP structure, the process flow may continue by forming <highlight><bold>760</bold></highlight> a second protective film in a pattern that will be aligned with a second electrode. As set forth herein, the second protective film may be formed under ALCVD conditions that will not substantially compromise the integrity of the FEP structure. Thereafter, a second electrode is formed <highlight><bold>770</bold></highlight> above and on the second protective film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Interface damage to the FEP structure may be significant only during formation of the second protective film. According to one surface engineering process flow, the L-B deposition <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight> process may be omitted. Accordingly, a process flow will proceed from forming <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> a lower electrode, forming <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight> a lower protective film, spin-on forming <highlight><bold>732</bold></highlight> an FEP layer, L-B depositing <highlight><bold>734</bold></highlight>, an upper, crystalline FEP layer, forming <highlight><bold>760</bold></highlight> an upper protective film, and forming <highlight><bold>770</bold></highlight> an upper electrode. According to this embodiment, processes may be omitted where not needed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> One embodiment of the present invention is a memory system. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> illustrates an elevational side view of part of a memory system <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> that is inserted into a host (not pictured) according to an embodiment of the present invention. The memory system <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> besides the host (not pictured) may include a memory article <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> disposed upon a substrate <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> that may be microprocessor silicon or the like. Alternatively, substrate <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> may be a board such as a fiberglass-resin (FR) card or motherboard including a current type referred to as FR<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the substrate <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> is depicted as microprocessor silicon that may contain logic circuitry thereon. A physical interface <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight> for a host is also depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. In one embodiment, physical interface <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight> may be a dual in-line lead frame package that will disposed upon a motherboard, an expansion card, and application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) board, or the like. A signal interface <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight>B is also depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. In this embodiment, signal interface <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight>A may be a bond wire that leads from the memory article <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> to packaging structures of physical interface <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight>. Signal interface <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight>B may also comprise a lead frame such as for a dual in-line package. Other embodiments of a signal interface may include optical interfaces including wave guides and spatial transmitter/receiver devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The data storage portion of the inventive memory system <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> may include the memory article <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> that is disposed on the substrate <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight>. As set forth herein, the memory article <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> may comprise a first electrode disposed on a substrate, an FEP structure, and a second electrode as set forth herein. Further, the memory article <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> may include first-and second crystalline FEP films as set forth herein as a surface-engineering solution to resist damage at the electrode-FEP interface. Other, more specific embodiments of the inventive memory system as set forth herein may be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Various physical interfaces may be employed with the inventive memory system <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight>, depending upon the appropriate host. The memory system <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> may be employed with a physical interface that is configured to a host type selected from communications hosts such as a PCMCIA card interface, a personal data assistant (PDA) interface with or without wireless communication ability, and a hand-held host such as a cellular telephone. Another host type may be a mobile data storage interface that may include a compact flash card interface, a MEMORY STICK&reg; interface made by Sony Corporation, a HIP ZIP&reg; or PEERLESS&reg; interface made by Iomega Corporation, a POCKET CONCERT&reg; interface made by Intel Corporation, and others. Another host type may be a removable storage medium interface, a desktop personal computer expansion slot interface, and the like. In each instance, the appearance of the specific physical interface <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight> will vary to take on the requisite receptacle, etc. of the host. Similarly, the appearance of the specific signal interface <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight> will vary to take on the requisite connector, etc. of the host. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> For example, a PCMCIA card has a physical interface comprising at least the long edges of the card that frictionally and slidingly connect with the card bay. The signal interface for a PCMCIA card comprises at least the female multi-contact sockets at the back of the card, and the specific plug-in outlets at the front of the card. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Low operating voltages are preferred and achieved by embodiments of the present invention. According to an embodiment, switching voltage may be in the range from about 0.5 V to less than about 9 V, and preferably in a range from about 0.5 V to about 5 V. This voltage may relate to both the destructive read method and the write method according to an embodiment. Nonvolatile memory such as flash may require charge pump technology to achieve a sufficient voltage to write to the floating gate. The present invention presents a low-voltage technology for nonvolatile memory that may obviate the need for charge pump technology and other higher-voltage memory technologies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The following is an example of a method of making an embodiment of the present invention. Reference may be made to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. First, a substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is provided, comprising logic-bearing silicon for an inventive cross-point polymer memory structure including a dielectric material such as silicon oxide. In substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a recess <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is etched and a PVD aluminum first electrode <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is formed within recess <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. A protective layer of TiN is formed by CVD. Again, limited to thermal budget restrictions, PECVD may be substituted for the usually higher-temperature CVD of TiN. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> After filling of recess <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> by PECVD of TiN to form a protective layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, a CMP process is carried out that reduces the Z-direction profile of the memory structure <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and converts protective layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to a damascene protective film <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Under L-B deposition conditions, a first crystalline FEP layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is formed to a thickness from about 5 &angst; to about 45 &angst;, preferably about 23 &angst; from P(VDF-TrFE). Because surface engineering of the ferroelectric polymer structure FEP <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> may only be of significance to the polymer material that is exposed to processing after the formation of structure <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, first crystalline ferroelectric polymer layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may be omitted as set forth herein. Next, a spin-on FEP layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is formed to a thickness from about 500 &angst; to about 2,000 &angst;, preferably about 1,000 &angst;. Spin-on FEP layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> may be formed by depositing the FEP material as a fluid in a puddle prime onto substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for a period of from about 5 to 25 seconds and spinning substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and in a rotational range from about 300 revolutions per minute (rpm) to about 6000 rpm and for a time range from about 5 seconds to about 20 seconds. Spin-on FEP layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> comprises a copolymer of (CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-CF<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>-(CHF-CF<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>m </subscript></highlight>wherein n and m equal 1, and wherein n is about 0.75. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> A second or upper crystalline FEP layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is L-B deposition formed to a thickness from about 5 &angst; to about 45 &angst;, preferably about 23 &angst; from P(VDF-TrFE). Where either first- and second-crystalline FEP layers <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, respectively are present, the layers in this example comprise a copolymer of (CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-CF<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>-(CHF-CF<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>m </subscript></highlight>wherein n and m equal 1, and wherein n is about 0.75. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, a mask (not depicted) is patterned in a cross-point configuration to first electrode <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The mask pattern exposes a width similar to the width of the first electrode. Thereafter, a protective TiN layer is formed with a thickness in the range from about 10 nm to about 100 nm is formed under PVD or ALCVD conditions that operate at or below about 100&deg; C. Thereafter, a second electrode is formed by PVD, also at operating conditions at or below about 150&deg; C. in order to protect the FEP structure <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. According to this example, the cross-point matrix polymer memory structure operates in a range below about 9 V, and preferably in a range from about 0.5 V to about 5 V. This voltage may relate to both the destructive read method and the write method according to an embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> It will be readily understood to those skilled in the art that various other changes in the details, material, and arrangements of the parts and method stages which have been described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of this invention may be made without departing from the principles and scope of the invention as expressed in the subjoined claims. </paragraph>
