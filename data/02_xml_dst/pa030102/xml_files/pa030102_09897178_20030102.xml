<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A third party gift certificate system and method. The gift certificate package comprises: a gift certificate printed on an exterior side of a sealed envelope, wherein the gift certificate includes a redeemable amount; and a bank check enclosed within the sealed envelope, wherein the bank check includes a payable amount. The gift certificate package is issued by a third party for a redeemable amount that is generally greater than the payable amount of the bank check. When the gift certificate is presented to a participating merchant, the participating merchant removes the bank check, thereby obtaining immediate payment. The third party profits from the difference between the redeemable amount of the gift certificate and the payable amount of the bank check. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Technical Field </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to packaging and processing third party redeemable instruments, and more particularly to a system and method for issuing and processing third party gift certificates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Gift certificates have become an invaluable tool for vendors to market their goods and services. In fact, almost all retail vendors, including restaurants, department stores, boutiques, on-line stores, etc., offer some form of gift certificates. For consumers, gift certificates provide a convenient mechanism to purchase and give a gift. In particular, gift certificates not only allow a purchaser to adhere to an exact budget, but they also virtually eliminate the often difficult gift selection process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> To further the usefulness and effectiveness of gift certificates, intermediary third parties have entered the gift certificate marketplace. Specifically, third parties enter into agreements with vendors and then sell gift certificates for the participating vendors pursuant to the agreement. This then allows consumers to purchase a gift certificate for any one of a number of participating vendors (e.g., stores or restaurants) from a single third party intermediary. To further increase flexibility, the third party may offer a universal gift certificate redeemable by a number of different vendors (e.g., the gift certificate may be valid at any store in a shopping mall). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In order to profit from this third party model, the third party generally keeps a portion of the gift certificate revenue. For example, if a third party sold a $100 gift certificate for a participating vendor, the third party would collect $100 from the customer, issue a $100 gift certificate to the customer for the participating vendor, and then pay the vendor the $100 less a transaction fee (e.g., $5). Thus, under this model, the customer would receive $100 worth of goods and/or services, the third party would profit $5 for each such transaction, and the vendor would receive $95. The fact that the vendor ends up selling their goods and/or services at a slight discount can be readily justified by the vendor as a marketing cost associated with guaranteed revenue. Thus, the third party model is convenient for the customer, and profitable to both the vendor and the third party. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, one of the drawbacks of the third party model described above is the fact that the gift certificate itself is not a liquid form of currency to the vendor. In other words, after the vendor receives the gift certificate, the vendor must look to the third party for reimbursement. This may result in a payment waiting period, and create some risk that the third party will default (thereby decreasing the value of the transaction). To alleviate this, an escrow can be set up for the vendor in order to ensure payment. However, the process of maintaining and tracking separate escrows for numerous vendors creates significant accounting overhead and costs for the third party. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, a need exists for a system and method in which third party gift certificates (and other redeemable instruments) can be issued and processed without creating additional costs and overhead to the parties involved. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The present invention overcomes the above-mentioned problems, as well as others, by providing a system and method for issuing redeemable instruments, such as gift certificates, in which the vendor receives immediate payment and the third party incurs little or no additional overhead. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In a first aspect, the invention provides a third party payment system, comprising: a first redeemable instrument printed on an exterior side of a sealed envelope, wherein the first redeemable instrument has a first redeemable value; and a second redeemable instrument enclosed within the sealed envelope, wherein the second redeemable instrument has a second redeemable value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In a second aspect, the invention provides a third party gift certificate system, comprising: a gift certificate printed on an exterior side of a sealed envelope, wherein the gift certificate includes a redeemable amount; and a check enclosed within the sealed envelope, wherein the check includes a payable amount. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In a third aspect, the invention provides a a method for implementing a third party payment system, comprising the steps of: issuing a redeemable instrument to a first party for a predetermined amount, wherein the redeemable instrument is provided by a third party and is printed on an exterior side of a sealed envelope, and wherein the sealed envelope contains a negotiable instrument; guaranteeing that the redeemable instrument can be redeemed in exchange for a consideration provided by a second party equal to the predetermined amount; and reimbursing the second party by allowing the second party to remove the negotiable instrument from the sealed envelope, wherein the negotiable instrument is payable to the second party for a payable amount.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the figures, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> depicts an exemplary third party gift certificate system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> issued by a third party pursuant to this invention. Gift certificate system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is packaged as a sealed envelope with a redeemable gift certificate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> printed on a front side. Gift certificate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> includes a redeemable or predetermined amount <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The redeemable amount <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> typically reflects both the redeemable dollar value of the gift certificate, as well as the amount the purchaser paid for the gift certificate (in this case, $10). Also included on gift certificate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are additional written indicia. For example, gift certificate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> includes spaces for indicating to whom the gift certificate is to be given <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>; from whom the gift certificate was given <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>; the name of the third party <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> who issued the gift certificate (e.g., Simply Certificates.com&trade;); an authorized signature <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>; a bar code <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>; etc. Also included is information <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> regarding the vendor or vendors where the gift certificate is valid. In this case, the gift certificate is valid at a plurality of participating merchants that are shown on the rear side of the gift certificate (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). It should be appreciated that while this preferred embodiment comprises a universal gift certificate (i.e., it is redeemable by a plurality of participating merchants), a gift certificate redeemable by only a single merchant could likewise be implemented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> As noted above, the gift certificate system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a sealed or enclosed envelope. The sealed envelope includes a removable top tab (or edge) <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and removable side tabs (or edges) <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Each tab is removable along perforations <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, thereby allowing the gift certificate envelope to be readily opened. Printed on each tab is a warning <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> that warns the gift certificate holder not to remove the tabs. If the tabs are removed by the gift certificate holder, the gift certificate is voided. Although this preferred embodiment utilizes a sealed envelope having removable tabs, any type of sealable (i.e., close-able) envelope or package could be utilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the back side <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the gift certificate system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is shown. As can be seen, the gift certificate is redeemable at a plurality of vendors or merchants. The back side also includes warnings <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> printed on each of the tabs. The gift certificate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is sold to a purchaser/giftor who, in turn, can give the gift certificate to a customer/giftee. The customer/giftee would then present the gift certificate to one of the participating vendors and redeem the gift certificate for consideration in the amount <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> listed on the front side of the gift certificate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Thus, in the case of a restaurant, the customer would receive a credit in the amount of the gift certificate (e.g., $10) towards the final bill. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> depicts the sealed envelope of gift certificate system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> being opened. Gift certificate system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> would typically only be opened by the vendor or merchant after the gift certificate has been presented and redeemed by a customer. As shown, gift certificate system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is opened by removing the tabs <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and then separating the front side of the gift certificate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> from the back side <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to reveal an enclosed second redeemable instrument, in this case, a negotiable bank check <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, bank check <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is made payable to the participating merchant(s) for a payable amount <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In the case of a universal gift certificate, where there are numerous participating merchants (i.e., possible payees), the check would be drafted in such a manner that the participating merchants, and only the participating merchants, could present the check for payment. Thus, the enclosed check <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> has no value to any party other than a participating merchant. Bank check <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> can be detached from the gift certificate system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by tearing it along perforation <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, when the participating merchant redeems the gift certificate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the merchant receives immediate reimbursement for the provided goods and services, simply by tearing open the envelope and removing bank check <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. As can be seen, the bank check <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is made out to a payable amount (e.g., $8) that is slightly less than the gift certificate redeemable amount (e.g., $10). Accordingly, the third party that sold the gift certificate would profit 20%, or $2 from the transaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> It should be understood that while this preferred embodiment describes a gift certificate system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> that includes a gift certificate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> printed on the outside of a sealed envelope, and a negotiable bank check <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> contained on the interior portion of the envelope, any type of redeemable instrument could be utilized. For the purposes of this invention, a &ldquo;redeemable instrument&rdquo; includes any type of gift certificate, coupon, ticket, money order, voucher, security, negotiable instrument, commercial paper, etc., (but specifically excludes postage). Thus, the instrument printed on the outside could comprise an airplane ticket, and the instrument contained on the inside could comprise a money order, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, an exemplary business model flow diagram <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is depicted. In a first step (I), a third party gift certificate issuer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> sells a gift certificate to a purchaser for $100. Pursuant to the transaction, the purchaser <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> receives a $100 gift certificate, which contains an enclosed bank check valuing $80. In a second step (II), purchaser <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> transfers the $100 gift certificate containing the $80 bank check to a customer <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> in the form of a gift (i.e., purchaser <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is the giftor and customer <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is the giftee). In a next step (III), customer <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> presents and transfers the $100 gift certificate to a participating merchant <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, where it is redeemed for $100 worth of goods or services (i.e., consideration). Finally, (IV) the participating merchant <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> opens the sealed envelope, removes the $80 bank check, and presents it to a bank <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> for payment. Preferably, a prearranged agreement <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> between third party <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and participating merchant <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is first established in order to implement this model. For example, in this case, third party <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and participating merchant <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> agreed that third party <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> would retain 20% of the gift certificate sale. Thus, the redeemable amount <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the gift certificate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> will generally be greater than the payable amount <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the bank check <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> It should be understood that the invention described here could be used for any transaction in which a third party issues any type of redeemable instrument, or in which it is merely desirable to package a second redeemable instrument inside a first redeemable instrument. Moreover, it should be understood that the dollar amounts described herein are for exemplary purposes only, and obviously other amounts could be utilized. For instance, although preferred, it is not required that the amount of the instrument on the outside of the envelope be greater than the amount of the instrument contained in the envelope. Furthermore, an explicit dollar amount need not be actually printed on one or both of the instruments (e.g., the instrument printed on the outside of the envelope could comprise an airplane ticket with no dollar amount). Thus, either instrument may have a &ldquo;value&rdquo; that may or may not equate to a fixed dollar amount. Finally, it should be understood that the step of gifting the redeemable instrument from purchaser <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to customer <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> comprises an optional step that is not necessary to practice the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The foregoing description of the preferred embodiments of this invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed, and obviously, many modifications and variations are possible. Such modifications and variations that may be apparent to a person skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of this invention as defined by the accompanying claims. </paragraph>
