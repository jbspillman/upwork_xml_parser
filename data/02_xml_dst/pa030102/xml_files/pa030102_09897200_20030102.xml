<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Technical Field </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Semiconductor devices containing a discontinuous cap layer are described herein. More particularly, semiconductor devices formed from substrates containing one or more conductive metal elements each having a cap material applied thereon as a discontinuous cap layer are described herein. Also described are methods for manufacturing such semiconductor devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Generally, semiconductor devices include a plurality of circuits which form an integrated circuit. Integrated circuits can be useful for computers and electronic equipment and can contain millions of transistors and other circuit elements that can be fabricated on a single silicon crystal semiconductor device, i.e., chip. For the device to be functional, a complex network of signal paths will normally be routed to connect the circuit elements distributed on the surface of the device. Efficient routing of these signals across the device can become more difficult as the complexity and number of the integrated circuits are increased. Thus, the formation of multi-level or multi-layered interconnection schemes such as, for example, dual damascene wiring structures, have become more desirable due to their efficacy in providing high speed signal routing patterns between large numbers of transistors on a complex semiconductor chip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> When fabricating integrated circuit wiring with a multi-layered scheme, an insulating or dielectric material, e.g., silicon oxide or the low dielectric constant insulators described herein, will normally be patterned with several thousand openings to create conductive line openings and/or via openings using photoprocessing techniques, e.g., photolithography with subsequent etching by a plasma process. These via openings are typically filled with a conductive metal material, e.g., aluminum, copper, etc., to interconnect the active and/or passive elements of the integrated circuits. The semiconductor device is then polished to level its surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A continuous cap layer is then normally deposited over the planarized surface featuring the dielectric material and conductive metal material. Next, a dielectric material is deposited over the continuous cap layer, via and conductive line openings are created within the dielectric layer as before, another conductive metal material is deposited within the openings and another continuous cap layer is deposited thereon. The process is then repeated to fabricate a multi-layer interconnect wiring system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, several problems exist when employing a continuous cap layer. First, the continuous cap layer possesses a relatively high dielectric constant, typically between 4 and 7, causing the resulting semiconductor device to also possess a relatively high effective dielectric constant, typically between 3 and 5. This, in turn, results in a higher capacitance between the conductive metal material causing the electric signals to travel at a slower speed with increased cross-talk through the interconnection wiring patterns. Second, the reliability of the semiconductor device is limited because the electromigration lifetime of the wiring structures is relatively short. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It would be desirable to provide a semiconductor device containing a discontinuous cap layer that can provide a relatively low effective dielectric constant for the device thereby allowing the electric signals to travel faster therethrough. This, in turn, will allow for the device to have a reduced effective capacitance. An increased electromigration lifetime of the device is also desirable. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Novel semiconductor devices containing a discontinuous cap layer, i.e., discontinuous cap elements, and possessing a relatively low dielectric constant have been discovered. The novel semiconductor device containing the discontinuous cap layer includes at least a substrate, a first dielectric layer applied on at least a portion of the substrate, a first set of openings formed through the dielectric layer to expose the surface of the substrate so that a conductive material deposited within and filling the openings provides a first set of electrical contact conductive elements and a discontinuous layer of cap material covering at least the top of the elements to provide a first set of discontinuous cap elements. Optionally, an opening is formed between the first set of conductive metal elements and through the dielectric layer to expose the surface of at least a portion of the substrate so that a second dielectric material is deposited in and fills the opening. This is known as a gap fill structure. The semiconductor device may also include a third dielectric layer applied on the top surfaces of the cap elements and first or second dielectric layer between the first set of conductive metal elements, a second set of openings formed through the third dielectric layer to expose the surface of at least a portion of the discontinuous cap elements so that a conductive metal material deposited within and filling the second set of openings provides a second set of electrical contact conductive metal elements, and a second cap material applied to and in contact with at least a portion of the top surface of the second set of conductive metal elements as a discontinuous layer to provide a second set of discontinuous cap elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> An alternative semiconductor device containing a discontinuous cap layer and possessing a relatively low effective dielectric constant in accordance with the present disclosure is also provided. The novel semiconductor device containing the discontinuous cap layer includes at least a substrate, a first dielectric layer applied on at least a portion of the substrate, a first set of openings formed through the dielectric layer to expose the surface of the substrate so that a conductive material deposited within at least a portion of the opening and a cap material applied to and in contact with the top surface of the conductive material and filling the remaining portion of the opening. Optionally, a gapfill opening formed between the first set of conductive metal elements and through the dielectric layer to expose the surface of at least a portion of the substrate so that a second dielectric material is deposited in and fills the opening. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A method for making the semiconductor device has also been discovered which comprises the steps of: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> a) providing a substrate having a dielectric layer formed thereon; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> b) forming at least a first and second opening in the dielectric layer and exposing the top surface of the substrate; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> c) depositing a conductive metal material within and filling the openings; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> d) depositing a cap material over the top surfaces of the first set of conductive elements and dielectric layer; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> e) etching the cap material over the dielectric layer and between the conductive metal elements to substantially remove the cap layer and expose the dielectric layer to provide a set of discontinuous cap elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> An alternative method for forming the semiconductor device comprises the steps of: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> a) providing a substrate having a first dielectric layer formed thereon; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> b) forming at least a first and second opening in the dielectric layer and exposing the surface of the substrate; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> c) depositing a mixture comprising a major amount of a conductive metal material and minor amount of a segregating metal material within and filling the first and second opening; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> d) heating the device in a selected gas mixture to a temperature and for a time period sufficient for the segregating metal material to segregate to the top of each opening and form on the surface of the conductive metal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> By forming discontinuous cap elements on the top surfaces of the conductive metal elements, the semiconductor devices containing the discontinuous cap elements described herein advantageously possess a low effective dielectric constant thereby causing the electric signals generated by the device to travel at a faster rate with reduced cross-talk. Thus, even if the cap material may have a high dielectric constant (e.g., SiNitride), the formation of the discontinuous cap elements results in a low effective dielectric constant for the overall device, e.g., an effective dielectric constant ranging from about 1.5 to about 3.5 in the case of no gapfill structure present in the device and an effective dielectric constant ranging from about 1.0 to about 3.0 and preferably about 1.5 and about 2.3 in the case of a gapfill structure present in the device.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> One embodiment in accordance with the present disclosure provides semiconductor devices including at least a semiconductor substrate containing, for example, a first dielectric layer and a first set of openings formed therein and filled with a conductive metal material to provide a first set of conductive metal elements and a first cap material applied on the top surface and in contact with at least a portion of the set of conductive metal elements to form a first set of discontinuous cap elements, i.e., discontinuous cap layers. The semiconductor device may also include a second dielectric layer applied on the surfaces of the discontinuous cap elements and first dielectric layer, a second set of openings formed within the second dielectric layer and exposing the surface of the cap elements therein, a conductive metal material deposited within and filling the openings to form a second set of conductive metal elements, and, a second cap material applied on the top surfaces and in contact with at least a portion of the second conductive metal elements to provide a second set of discontinuous cap elements. The semiconductor device may also include a plurality of layers of dielectric and metal elements formed according to the above description such as, for example, about 5 to about 10 layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Referring now to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>F, one such semiconductor device in accordance with the present disclosure can be formed by first providing a semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> that is of the conventional type and may contain, for example, circuitry and other interconnection levels. Generally, the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> will first have dielectric layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> formed on at least a portion thereon. Suitable materials for dielectric layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can include any conventional organic or inorganic porous and non-porous material known to one skilled in the art, particularly those materials with a low dielectric constant. It is particularly advantageous to employ porous dielectric materials herein since, as one skilled in the art would appreciate, these materials will decrease the effective dielectric constant of the semiconductor device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Preferred organic materials include, but are not limited to, organic thermosets such as, for example, SiLK, Flare, polyimides, polyarylene ethers, benzocyclobutenes and the like with SiLK being most preferred for use herein. The organic dielectric materials useful in forming organic dielectric layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will ordinarily possess a dielectric constant less than about 3 and preferably from about 2 to about 2.7. The average pore size and size distribution of these materials will ordinarily range from about 1 to about 50 nm, with less than about 10 nm being preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Preferred inorganic materials for use herein include, but are not limited to, materials composed of silicon oxide optionally containing one or more elements selected from C, H and F, e.g., FSG, C doped oxide, F doped oxide, alloys of Si, C, O and H, SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, and the like. Specific examples include, but are not limited to, Black Diamond from Applied Materials, Coral from Novellus Systems, and a variety of spin applied films based on hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ), methyl silsesquioxane (MSQ), phenyl silsesquioxane and the like. Also, porous forms of these materials may be used, with the average pore size being from about 1 to about 50 nm and preferably less than about 10 nm. The inorganic dielectric materials useful in forming inorganic dielectric layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will ordinarily possess a dielectric constant less than about 3.5 and preferably from about 2 to about 3. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Techniques and parameters for forming dielectric layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> on substrate <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> (e.g., spin coating) are within the purview of one skilled in the art. The dielectric layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can ordinarily be applied on the surface of substrate <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> as a substantially planarized layer. A substantially planarized layer can be achieved either directly through the formation process, e.g., in the case of a chemical vapor deposition or spin on technique, or by applying known and conventional procedures, e.g., chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP), once the dielectric layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has been formed to advantageously provide a substantially planarized surface as generally depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>. Typically, the thickness of dielectric layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will range from about 100 to about 600 nm and preferably from about 100 to about 300 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> When employing an organic dielectric material as layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, it is particularly advantageous to form a mask/polish stop layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on organic dielectric layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Suitable materials for mask/polish layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can include any conventional material known to one skilled in the art. Preferred materials for use herein include, but are not limited to, amorphous films of SiN, SiCH, SiCOH, silicon oxide and the like. Techniques and parameters for forming mask/polish stop layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are within the purview of one skilled in the art. This layer is advantageously employed as a hardmask and/or a chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP) stop layer when, as described below, for subsequent processing steps of the device, e.g., when forming openings <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and/or cap elements <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> discussed hereinbelow. Mask/polish stop layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can then be subjected to a planarization process such as, for example, a standard CMP polishing process known to one skilled in the art to remove any metal thereon and provide a substantially planarized surface. Optionally, layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may have about 2 or about 3 sub-layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Once inorganic dielectric layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or mask/polish stop layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has been formed on the surface of organic dielectric layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, openings <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> having a top portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>with defining sidewalls <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and lower portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are formed therein to expose the top surface of substrate <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference>. It is particularly advantageous to create openings that are of a dual damascene (via plus next level conductor) wiring interconnect structure for use herein. Openings such as the dual damascene structure can be formed in layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and organic dielectric layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or inorganic dielectric layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by techniques known to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> For example, at least one top portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of opening <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> will be formed in mask/polish stop layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and/or dielectric layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the top portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of opening <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> having a first width and defining sidewalls <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and bottom surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (not shown) by techniques known to those skilled in the art, e.g., a resist layer (not shown) can be applied to the top surface of dielectric layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and patterned and developed using known photolithographic techniques. Then an etching process is conducted to form top portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of opening <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The etch process can be, for example, a selective etch process or a suitable anisotropic etching technique such as reactive ion etching that etches the mask/polish stop layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, when employed, to form the top portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>.. In other words, by using this process, the depth of top portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of opening <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> formed during the etch process may be precisely controlled . Where layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is not employed, then the etch process can be a timed etch through a portion of inorganic layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to form top portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of opening <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which is within the purview of one skilled in the art. A desired width and depth of each top portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of opening <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> will normally vary according to the design requirements for a given conductor, i.e., the conductive material that will eventually be used in the conductive line and via openings as discussed hereinbelow. A preferred width of each top portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of opening <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> will ordinarily range from about 0.05 to about 10 &mgr;m and preferably from about 0.1 to about 1.2 &mgr;m while the depth will range from about 0.05 to about 1 &mgr;m and preferably from about 0.1 to about 0.4 &mgr;m. </paragraph>

A preferred width of each lower portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of opening <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> will ordinarily range from about 0.05 to about 5 &mgr;m and preferably from about 0.1 to about 0.6 &mgr;m.

<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Following the formation of openings <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a conductive material is deposited within and fills the top and lower portion of opening <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to form a set of conductive metal elements <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> having a top surface <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</cross-reference>. The set of conductive elements <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be formed by any known or conventional procedure, for example, by electroplating or selective or non-selective chemical vapor depositions (CVD&apos;s), sputtering or other physical vapor deposition. Any conventional conductive metal material can be used herein as the conductive material. Suitable metal materials for forming conductive elements <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> include, but are not limited to, Ti, TiN, TiW, Ta, TaN, W, Al, Cu, Pd and the like and combinations thereof with Cu being preferred for use herein. Excess metal commonly covers top surface <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, and is removed by, for example, CMP, leaving an essentially planar surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Next, a cap material is deposited on the top surfaces of inorganic dielectric layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or mask/polish stop layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and conductive metal elements <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> as continuous layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</cross-reference>. Suitable materials for forming cap layer include conventional dielectric diffusion barrier materials known to one skilled in the art. Preferred dielectric materials include silicon based dielectric materials such as, for example, silicon nitride, amorphous silicon carbide, amorphous alloys of Si, N, C and H, SiNOH, SiCOH and the like. Techniques for depositing cap layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are within the purview of one skilled in the art, e.g., PE CVD. The thickness of cap layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> will ordinarily range from about 10 to about 100 nm and preferably from about 20 to about 60 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Once cap layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> has been deposited as a continuous layer on the top surfaces of inorganic dielectric layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or mask/polish stop layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and conductive layer metal elements <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, cap layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> will be patterned in accordance with known and conventional procedures, e.g., applying a photoresist mask over inorganic dielectric layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or mask/polish stop layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and conductive metal elements <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, utilizing photolithography, employing a suitable selective etching technique to substantially remove the portion of the cap layer between the conductive metal elements <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and exposing the top surface of inorganic dielectric layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or mask/polish stop layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to provide discontinuous cap elements <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> on the top surface of conductive metal elements <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and then stripping the photoresist mask as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</cross-reference>. As one skilled in the art will readily appreciate, some portion of the cap material may remain on the top surface of inorganic dielectric layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or mask/polish stop layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> following the removal process. However, it is desired that all of the cap material be removed from the top surface top surface of inorganic dielectric layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or mask/polish stop layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to form the discontinuous cap elements <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> on the top surface of conductive metal elements <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, in the case where cap layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is deposited over inorganic dielectric layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, then the portion of the cap layer between the conductive metal elements <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and on the top surface of inorganic layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be selectively removed employing a suitable anisotropic etching technique such as, for example, reactive ion etching, to expose the top surface of inorganic dielectric layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and provide discontinuous cap elements <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> on the top surface of conductive elements <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In the case where cap layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is deposited over layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, then the portion of the cap material of cap layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> between the conductive metal elements <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and on the top surface of mask/polish stop layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be selectively removed employing (1) a suitable timed etch technique based on F etch chemistry when the cap material and mask/polish stop material possess the same etch rate or (2) a suitable selective etch technique when the cap material and mask/polish stop material possess different etch rates to expose the top surface of mask/polish stop layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and provide discontinuous cap elements <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> If desired, inorganic dielectric layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and organic dielectric layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be removed between conductive metal elements <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to provide a gapfill opening <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1F</cross-reference>. Generally, gapfill opening <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be formed by techniques known to in the art to substantially remove inorganic dielectric layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or layers <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. For example, a resist layer (not shown) can be applied to the top of the device. The resist layer is patterned and developed using known photolithographic techniques. Then etching(s) is conducted to form opening <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> such as, for example, by employing a suitable anisotropic etching technique, e.g., reactive ion etching (RIE). Parameters for creating opening <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (e.g., type of etchant(s), concentration of etchant(s), time, temperature, etc.) are within the purview of one skilled in the art. As one skilled in the art will readily appreciate, the sidewalls of top portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the conductive metal elements <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> will advantageously act as a hardmask during the etching procedure such that the width of opening <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> will be defined by the distance between the top portions of adjacent conductive elements <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> down to and exposing the surface of substrate <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Additionally, since the sidewalls of the top portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>between conductive metal elements <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> act as a hardmask during the etching process, some portion of the organic or inorganic dielectric material of layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will remain in the area underneath the top portion of conductive metal elements <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and along the sidewalls of lower portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and further in contact with the surface of the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Following the formation of opening <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, a relatively low dielectric constant material, e.g., one possessing a dielectric constant less than about 2.5 and preferably from about 1.5 to about 2.2, is deposited in and fills opening <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to form low dielectric constant filled element <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1G</cross-reference>. Suitable materials for use herein include, but are not limited to, porous spin-on materials containing pores within a dielectric matrix. This matrix may be comprised of, for example, Si oxide (Nanoglass), MSQ, or an MSQ/HSQ mixture. The average pore size and size distribution of these materials will ordinarily range from about 1 to about 50 nm, with less than about 10 nm being preferred. By filling gapfill opening <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> with a relatively low dielectric constant material, the resulting semiconductor device will advantageously possess a low effective dielectric constant, e.g., less than about 2.5 and preferably from about 1.5 to about 2.2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Optionally, additional layers (not shown) can be applied to the top surfaces of cap elements <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and/or inorganic dielectric layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or mask/polish stop layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or element <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. For example, a dielectric material, which is the same type of dielectric material used in forming layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, i.e., an organic or inorganic dielectric material whichever is employed, can first be applied over the top surface of the device and, optionally a second mask/polish stop layer depending if an organic dielectric layer is used, with openings formed therein as discussed above, the openings being created to expose at least a portion of the top surface of cap elements <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. A conductive metal material, e.g., Cu, can then be deposited within and filling each opening to form a second set of conductive metal elements. Next, a cap material can be applied over the top surfaces of the second set of conductive metal elements and dielectric or mask/polish stop layer as a continuous layer. Then the continuous cap layer is selectively etched between the second set of elements to provide a second set of cap elements on at least a portion of the top surface of the second set of conductive metal elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> As seen in the embodiments shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>D, an alternative semiconductor device described herein can be formed by first providing a semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> having a dielectric layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> formed thereon, optionally an mask/polish stop layer <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> in the case where dielectric layer is formed from an organic dielectric material, and openings <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> formed in dielectric layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and optional mask/polish stop layer <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> and exposing a portion of the surface of substrate <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>. Techniques and materials used in forming substrate <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, layers <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> and openings <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> are the same as those discussed with respect to the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference>. Thicknesses for each of the above layers and openings will also generally be the same as those used in forming the layers and openings of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference>. Optionally, layer <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> may have about 2 or about 3 sub-layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Next, a conductive metal material <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> and segregating cap material <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> are advantageously deposited in and filling openings <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> filling. The segregating material may be deposited as a separate layer, or a mixture comprising a major amount of the conductive metal material and a minor amount of the segregating cap material may be deposited. Generally, three steps are needed to form the structure of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B, e</cross-reference>.g., metal deposition, CMP, and an anneal step to segregate cap material <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> to the top of opening <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. After these three steps are completed, the conductive metal material <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> fills the lower portion <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of opening <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and at least a portion of top portion <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of opening <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, e.g., at a thickness ranging from about 0.05 to about 0.5 &mgr;m and preferably from about 0.1 to about 0.3 &mgr;m, with the segregated cap material <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> filling the remaining portion of top portion <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of opening <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, e.g., at a thickness ranging from 1 nm to about 10 nm and preferably from about 2 nm to about 5 nm, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>. In this manner, segregating cap material <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> can be formed on the surface of conductive metal material <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> as a discontinuous cap layer without having to perform subsequent lithography and etch steps as discussed above with respect to the continuous cap layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Suitable conductive metal materials for use herein include, but are not limited to, those discussed above with respect to filling opening <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with Cu being also being preferred for this embodiment. Suitable segregating cap material <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> for use herein include any conventional segregating materials known to one skilled in the art.

<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Generally, conductive metal material <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> and segregating cap material <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> can be deposited in opening <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> by first depositing one or more of the of the foregoing segregating cap materials <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> in opening <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> as a separate layer in the form of a thin film, i.e., coating, employing techniques known in the art or the segregating cap material may be deposited as a mixture of the conductive and segregating material also employing techniques known in the art. Three steps are generally needed to form the structure of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>; metal deposition, CMP, and an anneal step to segregate material <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> to the top of <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> as a layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In the case where segregating cap material <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is first deposited as a separate layer, the thin film of the segregating material will be typically applied at a thickness ranging from about 1 nm to about 100 nm and preferably from about 2 to about 5 nm. Next, conductive metal material <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> is deposited over the thin film and fills opening <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Techniques for depositing conductive metal material <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> can be the same as those discussed above. Following opening <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> being filled with the conductive material and the step of CMP to planarize the metal, the device will be subjected to an anneal step to segregate the cap material <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> to top portion <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of opening <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and being on the surface of conductive metal material <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>. In other words, the conductive metal material and segregating material (of the segregating oxide material) are subjected to a thermodynamic driving force by the annealing step to convert the segregating material to its oxide thereby resulting in the segregating oxide material <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> segregating to top portion <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of opening <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and being on the surface of conductive metal material <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>. Generally, the aneal step is performed at a temperature of from about 200 to 450&deg; C. for a time period ranging from about 10 to about 300 minutes in a gas mixture of, for example, H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O and H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, which reduces the copper oxide and, in turn, oxidizes the segregating material. The ratio of partial pressure of the hydrogen to water vapor (i.e., ratio P(H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)/P(H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O)) will ordinarily range from about 0.01 to 10,000 at about 200&deg; C. At about 400&deg; C., the ratio P(H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)/P(H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O) will ordinarily range from about 0.01 to about 1,000. A preferred anneal is at a temperature of about 400&deg; C. for about 240 minutes in a furnace made by bubbling a mixture of about 5% H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and 95% N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>through water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, in the case of depositing a mixture of the conductive and segregating materials, the segregating cap material and the conductive metal material are advantageously mixed in an amount ranging from about 1 nm to about 10 nm of a minor amount of the segregating material and from about 150 nm to about 2 microns of a major amount of conductive material. Then, the device is heat treated under similar anneal conditions as discussed above such that the segregating cap material will surface segregate and oxidize at the top portion <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of opening <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and form on the top surface of conductive metal material <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> as segregating oxide material <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> If desired, inorganic dielectric layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> or mask/polish stop layer <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> and organic dielectric layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> can be removed between openings <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> to provide a gapfill opening <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</cross-reference>. Generally, gapfill opening <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> can be formed by etching techniques discussed above. Following the formation of opening <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, a relatively low dielectric constant material, e.g., one possessing a dielectric constant of from about 1.5 to about 2.2 and preferably from about 1.5 to about 1.8, is deposited in and fills opening <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> to form low dielectric constant element <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</cross-reference>. Suitable material can generally be those discussed above with respect to element <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. By filling the gapfill opening <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> with a relatively low dielectric constant material, the resulting semiconductor device will advantageously possess a low effective dielectric constant, e.g., ranging from about 1.0 to about 3.0 and preferably from about 1.5 to about 2.3. </paragraph>

For example, a dielectric material, which is the same type of dielectric material used in forming layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, i.e., an organic or inorganic dielectric material whichever is employed, can first be applied over the top surface of the device and, optionally a second mask/polish stop layer depending if an organic dielectric layer is used, with openings formed therein as discussed above, the openings being created to expose at least a portion of the top surface of cap material <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. A conductive metal material, e.g., Cu, and segregating metal cap material can then be deposited within and filling each opening to form a second set of conductive metal material and metal oxide cap material elements. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The following example is given to illustrate a device containing an organic dielectric layer with a discontinuous dielectric cap layer and gapfill opening formed and then filled within the scope of this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The semiconductor substrate used in this example consists of a silicon wafer substrate of 200 mm diameter. First, the organic thermoset dielectric material SiLK from Dow Chemical Co. having a dielectric constant of 2.7 was spin coated on the top surface of the wafer at a thickness of 300 nm. As is known in the art, this material forms a substantially planarized surface by spin coating. Next, a mask/polish material comprised of Si, C and H was formed on the top surface of the organic dielectric layer as a mask/polish stop layer at a thickness of 50 nm. The layer was formed by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PE CVD) in an Applied Materials DxZ tool from trimethylsilane in a He carrier gas at 350&deg; C., although other techniques, conditions and tools may be used. A silicon oxide or nitride layer was formed also by PE CVD on top of the mask/polish stop layer completing a bilayer hardmask. A trilayer hardmask of both SiNitride and SiOxide and the mask/polish stop layer may also be used. A top portion of a first and second opening (the line pattern) was then created in the top hardmask layer by a first lithography and dry etch step, using methods known in the art. A second opening was then created in the lower layer of the hardmask in the first and second opening by a second lithography and dry etch step, using methods known in the art. These openings are then transferred into the SiLK layer as a lower portion of the openings using dry etch methods also known in the art. The lower portion of the opening, or via opening, was formed at a width of 120 nm, while the top portion of the opening, or line opening, was formed at a width of 140 nm. Additionally, the distance between the top portions of the first and second openings was150 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> To metallize the openings, first a thin conductive liner was deposited to line both the via and line openings, comprised of one or more layers of materials selected from the group TaN, Ta, Ti, TiN, W, and WN. Then, a thin Cu layer was deposited by physical vapor deposition (sputtering), and then a thick Cu layer was deposited to fill the openings by electrodeposition from solution. Finally the substrate was planarized by chemical mechanical polish (CMP) to form a set of conductive elements separated by regions of SiLK dielectric. During CMP, the top hardmask layers were removed leaving only the SiCH layer on top of the SILK between the conductive elements with the top surface of the SiCH layer being substantially co-planar with the top surface of the conductive elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> After this CMP planarization, an electroless plating process was used to selectively deposit a thin layer of a ternary alloy of Co, W and P on the top surface of the conductive elements at a thickness of 5 nm, although from 2 to 20 nm may also be used. The process details are known to one skilled in the art. Following the formation of the conductive metal elements followed by electroless plating, gapfill openings were then formed by dry etch methods, removing first the SiCH hardmask, and then the organic dielectric material remaining between the conductive elements. The SiLK dielectric material underneath the top portions of the conductive elements and in contact with the sidewalls of the lower portion of the elements remained in place as these gapfill openings are formed. The gapfill openings were then filled with a porous dielectric material consisting of a porous methylsilsesquioxane (MSSQ), using standard spin coating and baking methods. The preferred porosity was about 50% (the percentage of the MSSQ that is pores or voids) resulting in a dielectric constant of 1.5 for the porous dielectric. This was achieved by using 50% porogen in the MSSQ preparation. Porous films of this type are available from Japan Synthetic Rubber Corporation, Honeywell Inc. under the trade name of Nanoglass, from the IBM Almaden Research Center under the tradename of &ldquo;Dendriglass&rdquo; and other such suppliers as is well known to those well versed in this field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> During filling of the gapfill openings, the porous dielectric formed a thick film covering the entire substrate. The thick film was then removed by a chemical mechanical polish (CMP) process that stops at the Cu surface, leaving an approximately planar surface. As would be known in the art, other porous dielectric materials may be used including porous SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, porous HSQ (under trade name XLK from Dow Corning Inc.), porous SILK (from Dow Chemical Co.) and other such porous materials where the requirement was that they have a low dielectric constant below 2.0 and preferably substantially below 2.0. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> To complete the structure, a dielectric cap material of SiNitride having a dielectric constant of about 7.0 and a thickness of 35 nm was deposited as a blanket film atop the conductive elements and the planarized porous MSSQ dielectric. The SiNitride capping dielectric was formed by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PE CVD) using a gas flow containing silane and ammonia gases at 400&deg; C. Next, the portion of the SiNitride layer over the planarized porous MSSQ dielectric (between the conductive elements) was removed to form discontinuous cap elements of SiNitride on top of the Cu conductors. This removal was performed using a lithography and dry etch step using methods known in the art, and the same lithography MASK used in the second lithography and dry etch step may be used (because the pattern is identical). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Using a capacitance model, the effective overall dielectric constant of this device with a gapfill material having a dielectric constant of 1.5 was calculated to be 1.86. In contrast, the effective overall dielectric constant of the device with a gapfill material having a dielectric constant of 1.5 and a continuous cap layer (in the case where the portion of the SiNitride layer over the planarized porous MSSQ dielectric is not removed) was calculated to be 2.44. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> As would be known to one skilled in the art, the dielectric constant of the gapfilled ILD (porous MSSQ) may be changed and the effective overall dielectric constant of the device will change accordingly. For example, when the dielectric constant of the gapfilled ILD (porous MSSQ) is 2, the effective overall dielectric constant of the device was 2.8. In contrast, the effective overall dielectric constant of the device with a gapfill material having a dielectric constant of 2.0 and a continuous cap layer (in the case where the portion of the SiNitride layer over the planarized porous MSSQ dielectric is not removed) was calculated to be 3. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Also, the cap composition may be changed within the scope of the invention, so that SiNitride in this example may by replaced by alloys of Si, C, H, or Si, N, C, and H, or by any diffusion barrier material for which a dry etch process is known. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The following example is given to illustrate a device containing an organic dielectric layer with a discontinuous InOxide plus Silicon Nitride cap layer and gapfill opening formed and then filled within the scope of this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The semiconductor substrate used in this example consists of a silicon wafer substrate of 200 mm diameter. First, an organic thermoset dielectric material SiLK from Dow Chemical Co. having a dielectric constant of 2.7 was spin coated on the top surface of the wafer at a thickness of 300 nm. As is known in the art, this material forms a substantially planar surface by spin coating. Next, a mask/polish material comprised of Si, C and H or SiN was formed on the top surface of the organic dielectric layer as a mask/polish stop layer at a thickness of 50 nm. The layer was formed by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PE CVD) in an Applied Materials DxZ tool from an appropriate precursor gas such as trimethylsilane (for the SiCH) or silane and ammonia (for the SiN) diluted in a He carrier gas at 350&deg; C. although other techniques, conditions and tools may be used. A silicon oxide or nitride layer was formed also by PE CVD on top of the first layer completing a bilayer hardmask. A trilayer hardmask of both SiNitride and SiOxide and the mask/polish stop layer may also be used. A top portion of a first opening and second opening (the line pattern) was created in the top hardmask layer by a first lithography and dry etch step, using methods known in the art. A second opening was then created in the lower layer of the hardmask of the first and second opening by a second lithography and dry etch step, using methods known in the art. A lower portion of each opening was then transferred into the SiLK layer using dry etch methods also known in the art. The lower portion of the openings, or via openings, was formed at a diameter of about 120 nm while the top portion of the openings, or line openings, was formed at a width of about 140 nm. Additionally, the distance between the top portions of the first and second openings was about 150 nm. Other mask/polish stop schemes can be used which may include three layer structures comprising SiCH or SiCOH, SiN and SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, for example, to improve the ease of processing and the definition of the patterned features transferred into the SiLK layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> To metallize the openings, first a thin conductive liner was deposited to line both the top portion and lower portions of the openings. The liner was formed from one or more layers of materials selected from the group TaN, Ta, Ti, TiN, W, and WN. The liner structure was deposited by PE CVD, sputtering, reactive sputtering or combinations thereof. Then, a thin Cu layer was deposited by physical vapor deposition (sputtering) or chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and then a thick Cu layer was deposited to fill the openings by electrodeposition from solution. Finally the substrate was planarized by chemical mechanical polish (CMP) to form a set of conductive elements separated by regions of SiLK dielectric. During CMP, the top hardmask layer was removed leaving only the SiCH or the SiN layer on top of the SILK between the conductive elements. The top surface of the residual hardmask layer was substantially co-planar with the top surface of the conductive elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> After this CMP planarization, the substrate is heated to 350&deg; C. in vacuum or in an oxygen-free furnace to remove adsorbed molecules and then a thin layer of In was deposited at a thickness of 5 nm by physical vapor deposition (sputtering or evaporation) on the top surface of the conductive elements. The process details are known to one skilled in the art. The substrate was then annealed at 400&deg; C. for 240 minutes in a furnace ambient made by bubbling a mixture of 5% H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and 95% N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>through water to convert the In to In<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. The ratio of partial pressure of the hydrogen to water vapor (ratio P(H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)/P(H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O) ) was in the range from 0.01 to 1,000 at 400&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Following the formation of the conductive metal elements and In<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>formation, gapfill openings were then formed by dry etch methods. First, the residual hardmask (SiN or SiCH) was removed followed by the SiLK organic dielectric layer between the conductive elements. The SiLK dielectric material underneath the top portions of the conductive elements remained in contact with the sidewalls of the lower portion as the gapfill openings were formed. The gapfill openings were then filled with a porous dielectric material consisting of a porous methylsilsesquioxane (MSSQ) with a porosity of about 50% (the volume percentage of the voids in the matrix) resulting in a dielectric constant of about 1.5 for the porous dielectric using standard spin coating and baking methods. This was achieved by using about 50% porogen or pore generating material in the resin preparation. During filling of the gapfill openings, the porous dielectric formed a thick film covering the entire substrate and the thick film was then removed by a chemical mechanical polish (CMP) process that stops at the Cu surface, leaving an approximately planar surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> To complete the structure, a dielectric cap material comprised of SiNitride and having a dielectric constant of about 7.0 was deposited at a thickness of 35 nm as a blanket film atop the conductive elements and the planarized porous MSSQ dielectric. The SiNitride capping dielectric was formed by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PE CVD) using a gas flow containing silane and ammonia gases at 400&deg; C. Next, the portion of the SiNitride layer over the planarized porous MSSQ dielectric and between the conductive elements was removed to form discontinuous cap elements on top of the Cu conductors. This removal was performed using a lithography and dry etch step employing the same lithography mask used in the first lithography and dry etch step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Using a capacitance model, the effective overall dielectric constant of this device with a gapfill material having a dielectric constant of 1.5 was calculated to be 1.86.

<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The following example is given to illustrate a device containing an organic dielectric layer with a discontinuous SiNitride cap layer and with a buried RIE stop within the scope of this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The semiconductor substrate used in this example consists of a silicon wafer substrate of 200 mm diameter. First, a dielectric stack of 3 sub-layers was deposited on the top surface of the wafer. There were 2 layers of a organic thermoset dielectric material (such as SiLK from Dow Chemical Co.) and having a dielectric constant of 2.7. The thickness of each layer was about 150 nm. Between the layers was a layer of a Si containing spin-on dielectric (such as HOSP from Honeywell Corp.) that was 30 nm thick. As is known in the art, these materials form a substantially planarized surface by spin coating, and also different thicknesses for the 3 sub-layers may be used within the scope of the invention. Next, a mask/polish stop layer comprised of Si, C and H was formed on the top surface of the organic dielectric layer at a thickness of 50 nm. The layer was formed by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PE CVD) in an Applied Materials DxZ tool from trimethylsilane in a He carrier gas at 350&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> A silicon nitride (SiN) layer was formed also by PE CVD on top of the SiCH layer, and then a 3rd layer, commonly SiOxide, was deposited by PE CVD, completing a trilayer hardmask. A top portion of a first and second opening (the line pattern) was then created in the top SiOxide hardmask layer by a first lithography and dry etch step, using methods known in the art. A second opening was then created in the SiN and SiCH layers of the hardmask of the first and second opening by a second lithography and dry etch step, using methods known in the art. These openings were then transferred into the SiLK layer to form a lower portion of the first and second opening using dry etch methods also known in the art.

The SiNitrde capping dielectric was formed by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PE CVD) using a gas flow containing silane and ammonia gases at 400&deg; C . Next, the portion of the SiNitride layer over the SiCH Hardmask layer was removed to form discontinuous cap elements comprised of SiNitride on top of the Cu conductors. This removal was performed using a lithography and dry etch step using methods known in the art, and the same lithography MASK used in the first lithography and dry etch step may be used (because the pattern is identical). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Using a capacitance model, the effective overall dielectric constant of this device with a gapfill material having a dielectric constant of 1.5 was calculated to be 2.95. In contrast, the effective overall dielectric constant of the device with a gapfill material having a dielectric constant of 1.5 and a continuous cap layer (in the case where the portion of the SiNitride layer is not removed) was calculated to be 3.4. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> A porous dielectric may also be used within this invention. Examples are porous methylsilsesquioxane (MSSQ), porous SiLK, porous films available from Japan Synthetic Rubber Corporation, Honeywell Inc. under the trade name of Nanoglass, and as the material called &ldquo;Dendriglass&rdquo; from the IBM Almaden Research Center and other such suppliers as is well known to those well versed in this field. When a porous dielectric was used, the effective overall dielectric constant of the device was reduced. Also within this invention, the buried RIE stop can be left out of the structure. Also, the Cap composition may be changed within the scope of the invention, so that SiNitride in this example may by replaced by alloys of Si, C, H, or Si, N, C, and H, or by other suitable materials. </paragraph>
