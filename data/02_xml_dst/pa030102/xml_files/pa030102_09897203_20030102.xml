<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to transformers, and more specifically, the invention relates to a laminated transformer system and method. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Transformers are electrical devices commonly used to transfer an alternating current or voltage from one electric circuit to another by means of electromagnetic induction. A transformer typically consists of two or more conductor windings placed on the same iron core magnetic path. The conductor windings, or coils, produce a magnetic field flux that is associated with the electrical current that passes through them. The iron core is generally made up of sheets or laminations of rolled iron, such as electrical grade steel. Laminating the core minimizes magnetic eddy current production and hysteresis. The iron may be treated so that it has a high magnetic conduction quality, or permeability, throughout the length of the core. One application of a transformer, for example, is as a ballast component in a high-intensity discharge lamp. In this and other applications, the transformer should function in a quiet and efficient manner while minimizing heat production. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Currently, transformer cores may be welded at two locations that serve to hold the laminations primarily in a horizontal direction. A shortcoming of this welding strategy is that the individual laminations may separate at their corners in a vertical direction. Repeated handling or lifting of the transformer produces stress forces on the unit that may result in a &lsquo;fanning&rsquo; of the lamination corners. The separation of the lamination corners may be visually unappealing and may even result in increased noise production and failure of the transformer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In order to prevent the &lsquo;fanning&rsquo; of the laminations, additional welds have been applied near the corners of the transformer core. This strategy has been proven effective for preventing lamination separation, but has also resulted in disruption of the magnetic field flux. The additional material introduced by the weld and subsequent deformation of the transformer housing typically results in the formation of magnetic eddies and, as a consequence, hysteresis. This may reduce the efficiency of the unit and produce additional heat. As such, welding the laminations near the corners is not a practical solution for the prevention of &lsquo;fanning&rsquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In summary, the laminations of transformer cores are typically held together by a set of primary welds. The primary welds, however, do not prevent the separation of the laminations at their corners. Previous attempts to bond the laminations near their corners have resulted in reduced unit efficiency and increased hysteresis and heat generation of the transformer. Therefore, it would be desirable to achieve a strategy for bonding the transformer laminations in a manner that overcomes the aforementioned and other disadvantages. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENTLY PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Referring to the drawings, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is an elevated perspective view of one embodiment of the present invention designated in the aggregate as numeral <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The transformer system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may include a laminated housing <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, at least one low power weld <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, at least one primary weld <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and a coil assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> including a first coil <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and second coil <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The laminated housing <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may include a plurality of laminates that form a magnetic core. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> As further shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> laminate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of one embodiment may include three separate components <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. The components may be arranged to form a double-window type configuration known in the art. For example, a centrally located leg <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and two parallel yokes <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> positioned perpendicular to and at opposite ends of the central leg <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The two yokes <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> project laterally outward from the central leg <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and are joined at both ends by outer legs <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The outer perimeter of the arranged laminate components <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> may form the laminated housing <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The components may form laminates for a single-window type, a cross or modified type, or other configuration type transformer. The laminate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> need not be manufactured from separate components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> As further shown in cross-section in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> plurality of laminates <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be positioned parallel and adjacent to one another in a stacked arrangement. The laminates <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be manufactured from an electrical grade steel material and may comprise a magnetic core <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the laminates <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be treated to obtain a high magnetic conduction quality, or permeability, throughout the length of the magnetic core <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Those skilled in the art will recognize that a variety of laminate materials, treatments, components, and arrangements may be selected for use in the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 2</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the coil assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be positioned within the laminated housing <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the coil assembly may include a first coil <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and a second coil <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> disposed on the magnetic core <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The coils <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> may be positioned adjacent to one another and coaxially with the central leg <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. In another embodiment, the coil assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be positioned on separate legs. The coils <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> may each include a wire, or winding, wound around the coil axis to carry an electrical current. Each winding may be electrically connected to a circuit. During transformer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> operation, the first coil <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> winding may be energized by a primary electrical current to produce a magnetic field flux. The magnetic field flux, then, may induce a secondary electrical current within the secondary coil <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> winding. The secondary electrical current may be proportional to the nature of the wire windings. The nature of the wire windings includes factors such as wire composition, number of windings, and the like. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the nature of the wire windings may be varied for use in the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> At least one low power weld <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may be applied on the laminated housing <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to bond the laminates <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> together. In one embodiment, two low power welds <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may be applied on each of opposing laminated housing <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> sides. Each low power weld <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may be placed adjacent an outer edge of the laminated housing <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> side. The use of low power weld(s) <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may ensure that the magnetic field produced by the coil assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is not substantially disrupted during transformer operation. In one embodiment, the low power weld <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may comprise a tungsten inert gas weld. The low power weld <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may be applied with an electrical welding power setting of about 100 amps. In one embodiment, the low power weld <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may comprise a low penetration weld. The aforementioned types of low power welds minimize laminate deformation thereby preventing eddy formation and subsequent magnetic field disruption. Furthermore, the low power weld(s) <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may prevent the &lsquo;fanning&rsquo; of the laminated housing corners and may reduce transformer noise production. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the low power weld(s) may be applied in a variety of positions and orientations on the laminated housing to achieve one or more of the aforementioned advantages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> At least one primary weld <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be applied on the laminated housing <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to bond the laminates <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> together. In one embodiment, two primary welds <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be applied on each of opposing laminated housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> sides. The primary weld(s) may be placed at the joints of the laminate components <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> to functionally bond said components together and the laminates <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to one another. In one embodiment, the primary weld <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be applied with a power setting of about 170 amps. The use of primary weld(s) <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is known in the art and may bond the laminates <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in a single direction as in, for example, a horizontal direction. The primary weld(s) <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may not, by themselves, prevent the &lsquo;fanning&rsquo; of the laminated housing <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> corners. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> A method for attaching a laminated housing <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to a transformer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may include applying a low power weld <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to the laminated housing <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The laminated housing <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may include a plurality of laminates <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The laminates <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be bonded together without substantially disrupting a magnetic field produced by a coil assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The coil assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be positioned within the laminated housing <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The low power weld <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may comprise a tungsten inert gas weld and may comprise a low penetration weld.
