<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a rotary phase separator for separating liquid from gas in a zero or variable gravity environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Typically, the separation of gas from a liquid is accomplished by allowing entrapped gas to bubble upward out of the liquid under the influence of gravity. This method does not work in zero or variable gravity environment encountered by space vehicles. Typically, in such environments, a liquid/gas circulation system is used that includes a circulating pump; an accumulator to accommodate volume changes in the liquid/gas mixture and a separator to separate the liquid phase from the gas phase. Such systems are utilized to generate oxygen by electrolysis of water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Current state of the art systems utilize bellows accumulators to accommodate volume changes due to variation in the amount of oxygen being delivered and a special membrane separator to remove generated gas from the liquid stream. When used in a zero gravity environment, a bellows accumulator can become gas bound, leading to reduced liquid capacity in the accumulator. The membrane separator must be replaced often because the membrane becomes contaminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> To eliminate the need for a membrane separator, a rotary phase separator that uses centrifugal force to separate the liquid phase from the gas phase can be utilized. However, a typical rotary phase separator requires a liquid control system that vents accumulated gas as necessary to maintain a relatively constant liquid level. Further, in such systems it is of critical importance that the separated phases not be mixed upon exit of the separator such as may occur on start up before sufficient rotational speed has been attained to sufficiently separate the phases of the mixture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> For this reason it is desirable to develop a system that does not become contaminated during use, which does not require periodic replacement and which can accommodate liquid level fluctuations, thereby acting as an accumulator. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The invention is a rotary phase separator assembly including an accumulator and a liquid outlet valve for use in a closed loop recirculating system to separate the phases of a liquid/gas mixture at varying liquid levels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The rotary phase separator has a separating chamber capable of accommodating different liquid levels and thereby acts as an accumulator for a closed loop gas/liquid-recirculating system. The rotary phase separator assembly includes an accumulator/separator chamber defined by an inlet housing and an outlet housing. The accumulator/separator chamber is cylindrically shaped about a longitudinal axis. An inlet port for the liquid/gas mixture opens tangentially into the accumulator/separator chamber such that incoming flow of the mixture initiates a spinning motion. The inlet port opens into a pre-swirl chamber that begins the separation of the liquid from the gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The liquid and gas continue to rotate about the axis and are driven by a plurality of disks and cylinders attached to a hollow shaft driven by a motor. Hydrodynamic bearings are provided to support the shaft such that the shaft will rotate on a cushion of liquid drawn from the accumulator/separator chamber. The hydrodynamic bearings substantially eliminate any mechanical friction to increase the reliability and life of the entire assembly. The disks and cylinders are in frictional contact with the liquid/gas mixture to create a centrifugal force that throws the liquid toward the outer diameter of the accumulator chamber. As the liquid is thrown to the outside of the accumulator chamber, the gas is displaced and migrates toward the axis about the hollow shaft. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The disks include a plurality of holes disposed near the axis to allow gas to flow through the disks along the shaft to an opening within the shaft leading to the hollow portion of the shaft. Gas within the hollow section of the shaft exits through a non-rotating gas outlet tube to a gas outlet port. The gas outlet tube includes a valve member actuated by a solenoid to seal the gas outlet tube shut when the shaft is not rotating and until sufficient gas has accumulated within the accumulator/separator chamber to facilitate phase separation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The valve is required to prevent liquid from exiting through the gas outlet port. The inner walls of the hollow section of the shaft are tapered toward the opening in the shaft. With the shaft spinning, centrifugal force drives any liquid trapped within the hollow section along the tapered walls of the shaft and through to the opening to reenter the accumulator/separator chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Liquid rotating along the outer diameter of the accumulator/separator chamber exits through a liquid outlet valve. The liquid outlet valve includes a valve seal biased closed against inner and outer seats by a plurality of control springs equally positioned about the outer diameter of the accumulator/separator chamber. The control springs exert sufficient load on the valve seal to remain closed until a predetermined pressure differential is reached between liquid in the liquid outlet and liquid in the accumulator/separator chamber. Control of the liquid outlet is required to prevent gas from exiting along with the liquid through the liquid outlet during system start up. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The subject invention includes an accumulator chamber to accommodate varying levels of liquid such that a separate liquid control system is not required, and gas and liquid outlet control valves that remain closed until the rotary phase separator attains optimal separation conditions to prevent mixing of phases between the liquid and gas outlet ports.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Referring to the Figures, wherein like numerals indicate like or corresponding parts throughout the several views, the subject invention is a rotary phase separator assembly for separating a liquid from a gas contained in a liquid/gas mixture and is generally shown at <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The rotary phase separator separates phases of the liquid/gas mixture by using a motor <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> to drive a shaft <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> having a plurality of disks <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and cylinders <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> that contact the liquid/gas mixture to spin the liquid such that centrifugal force drives the liquid toward an outer diameter <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> thereby creating a liquid ring <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> that displaces gas. The gas then migrates toward the center to create a gas core <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The liquid and gas are then exhausted from the chamber through separate outlet ports. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The rotary phase separator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes an inlet housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and an outlet housing <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> connected to one another to form an inner accumulator/separator chamberl<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The accumulator/separator chamber <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is cylindrical with the outer diameter <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> concentric about a longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Preferably the inlet housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> includes extended sections <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that are attached to the outlet housing <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The connection of the outlet housing <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to the inlet housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be accomplished by any means known by a worker skilled in the art. A seal <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> seals the connection point between the housings <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The inlet housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> includes an inlet opening <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, tangential to the outer diameter of the pre-swirl chamber <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> A motor <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> mounted to the inlet housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> drives a shaft <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> about the longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Preferably the motor <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is a canned electric motor. A canned electric motor is only one possible means of rotating the shaft <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. It is within the contemplation of this invention that any motor known by a worker skilled in the art can be used to drive the shaft <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Further the shaft may be driven by alternate methods, such as being driven off of a hydraulic pump or other adjacent apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Bearing assemblies <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> disposed within the inlet and outlet housings <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> support the shaft <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> for rotation about the longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the bearing assemblies <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are hydrodynamic bearings. Hydrodynamic bearing assemblies are known in the art and support the shaft <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> for rotation on a cushion of liquid. Rotating the shaft <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> on a cushion of liquid substantially eliminates mechanical contact such that friction is substantially reduced. The use of hydrodynamic bearings substantially increases the operational life of the rotary phase separator assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The inlet and outlet housings <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> include liquid inlet passages <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and liquid exhaust passages <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to provide liquid flow to the hydrodynamic bearings. The bearing assembly <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> disposed in the inlet housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is a radial bearing to support rotation of the shaft <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The bearing assembly <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> disposed in the outlet housing <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> includes a radial and a thrust bearing such that the end of the shaft <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is supported for rotation and restrained from movement along the longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The shaft <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> includes a hollow section <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> in communication with a gas outlet <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The plurality of disks <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are secured to the shaft <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and extends radially toward the outer diameter <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the accumulator/separator chamber <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Each disk <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> includes a hub portion <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> that is secured to the shaft <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Preferably a last disk <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is secured to the shaft by a keyway connection <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> on the shaft <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Each succeeding disk <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> slides over the shaft and engages the proceeding disk such that all the disks are locked with one another to rotate with the shaft <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. A nut <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> threads onto the shaft and tightens down against the disk hub portions <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> to secure the disk <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to the shaft <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. This is only one means of securing the disks <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to the shaft <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and any means known by a worker skilled in the art is within the contemplation of this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Preferably there are seven disks <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and each disk includes a plurality of openings <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> disposed near the hub portion <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. The openings <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> provide the flow of gas through the disks <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The disks <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> also include a cylindrical section <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> that extends perpendicularly about a circumference of the disks <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. In the preferred embodiment a last disk <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> includes a cylindrical section <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and a first disk <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> nearest the inlet opening <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> does not include the cylindrical section <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. The first disk <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> does not include a cylindrical section <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> to allow the incoming liquid/gas mixture to freely flow into the accumulator/separator chamber <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> thereby reducing or eliminating any possible back pressure through the inlet opening <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The last disk <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> includes a series of vanes <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> disposed radially on a side of the disk <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> facing the outlet housing <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The vanes <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> extend from the disk <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> to within close proximity of the inside of the housing <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The inclusion of a vane <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> on the last disk <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is necessary to prevent liquid from accumulating about the shaft <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and migrating into the gas outlet <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The disks <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and cylinders <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> rotate and are in frictional contact with the liquid ring <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The frictional contact between the liquid ring <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and the disks <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and cylinders <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> maintains rotation of the liquid and creates a centrifugal force that drives the liquid ring <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> toward the outer diameter <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the accumulator/separator chamber. A gap <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> disposed between cylinders <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> allows liquid to move toward the outer diameter <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the accumulator/separator chamber <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and allows gas to move radially inward toward the longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The hollow section <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of the shaft <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> includes openings <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> that open to the accumulator/separator chamber <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The hollow section <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> includes and inner walls <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> that taper toward the openings <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> such that liquid trapped within the hollow section <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of the shaft <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is driven toward the openings by centrifugal force created by rotation of the shaft <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and exits through the openings <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> into the accumulator/separator chamber <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Preferably, a gas outlet tube <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> extends within the hollow section <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of the shaft <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> from the gas outlet <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The gas outlet tube <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> includes an opening <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> at a distal end <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and a valve member <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> actuated by a solenoid <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> to close the opening <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> of the gas outlet tube <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. A seal <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> disposed on the valve member <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> seals against the opening <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. The solenoid <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> may be of any type known by a worker knowledgeable in the art. When the valve member <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is open, gas enters the gas outlet tube <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and exits the gas outlet <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> liquid outlet valve <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is disposed within a cavity <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> of the outlet housing <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and extends annularly about the accumulator/separator chamber <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Seals <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> seal between the liquid outlet valve <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and the outlet housing <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The liquid outlet valve <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> includes an inner and outer seat <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> that define an opening <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> perpendicular to the longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The outer seat <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is disposed on a member <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> that extends angularly outward from the outer diameter <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the accumulator/separator chamber <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. A washer shaped elastomeric valve seal <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> seals against the inner and outer seats <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and is biased toward a closed position by plurality of control springs <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the valve seal <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> is formed from an elastomeric material, however it is within the contemplation of this invention to use any material known to a worker skilled in the art. A poppet <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is disposed between the valve seal <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and the control spring <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to guide movement of the valve seal <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>. Each control spring <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is set within a spring pocket <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. An outlet sleeve <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> maintains spacing between the inner and outer seats <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> such that the inner and outer seats <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> remain coplanar. A de-swirl chamber <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is disposed adjacent the opening <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Liquid passing between the upper and lower seats <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> flows through a substantially perpendicular bend into the de-swirl chamber <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> that acts to settle the turbulent effects of liquid rotating in the accumulator/separator chamber <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The control springs <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are of a predetermined load such that the valve seal <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> remains closed until a predetermined difference in pressure between liquid in the de-swirl chamber <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and the accumulator/separator chamber <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is reached. Such a pressure differential occurs when liquid is being drawn from the assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> such as by a pump (not shown). Liquid within the de-swirl chamber <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> exits through an outlet port <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. The outlet port <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>, best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, is disposed tangential to the accumulator/separator chamber <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Referring back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the quantity of liquid in the accumulator/separator chamber <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is determined by measuring the difference in pressure between the liquid ring <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and the gas core <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. To measure this difference the outlet housing includes a gas pressure tap <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> disposed near the center of the accumulator/separator chamber <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and a liquid pressure tap <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> disposed near the outer diameter <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the accumulator/separator chamber <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The dashed lines <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> indicate a maximum and minimum inner diameter of the liquid ring <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The amount of liquid within the accumulator/separator chamber <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can vary between a maximum where the liquid ring <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> has an inner diameter indicated by dashed line <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> that is disposed just above the openings <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> through the disks <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. A minimum amount of liquid is indicated by dashed line <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> where the inner diameter of the liquid ring <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> extends just to the inside of the cylinders <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. The effective volume of the liquid within the accumulator/separator chamber <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is measured between the first disk <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and the last disk <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and varies depending on the inner diameter <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> of the liquid ring <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In operation, the liquid/gas mixture enters the accumulator/separator chamber <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> through the inlet opening <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in a tangential manner, best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, much like directing flow from a house around the inner walls of a bucket. The liquid initially enters the pre-swirl chamber <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> adjacent the accumulator/separator chamber <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Initial separation of the liquid from the gas begins within the pre-swirl chamber <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The preliminary separation of the liquid and the gas occurs with the heavier liquid thrown outward toward the outer diameter <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the accumulator/separator chamber <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the lighter gas being displaced by the liquid and migrating toward the center about the longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The partially separated liquid/gas mixture then enters the accumulator/separator chamber <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> past the first disk <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The first disk <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> does not include a cylinder section <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> in order to substantially reduce backpressure into the inlet opening <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The motor <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> rotates the shaft <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and thereby the disks <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> in a direction common to the incoming flow of liquid/gas mixture. As the liquid/gas mixture flows around the first disk <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, the gas is displaced by the liquid and thereby moves toward the longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to form the gas core <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The liquid moves toward the outer diameter <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the accumulator/separator chamber <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to form the liquid ring <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The rotation of the disks <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and cylinders <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> maintains the incoming rotation of the liquid portion of the mixture along the outer diameter <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the accumulator/separator chamber <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Rotation of the disks <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and cylinders <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> generates a centrifugal force that drives the liquid toward the outer diameter <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the accumulator/separator chamber away from the longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The gas core <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> forms because the heavier liquid displaces the lighter gas to form the gas core <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> within the liquid ring <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Gas flows through the openings <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> in the disks <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> toward the openings <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> to the hollow section <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of the shaft <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Within the hollow section <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of the shaft <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is the non-rotating gas outlet tube <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> that exhausts gas to the gas outlet <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The opening <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> of the gas outlet tube <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> remains closed until sufficient gas accumulates in the gas core <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to assure effective separation of liquid and gas. Once sufficient gas has accumulated the solenoid <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> actuates the valve member <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> to open the gas outlet tube <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. Actuation of the solenoid <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> may be by any means known by a worker knowledgeable in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Liquid from the liquid ring exits the accumulator/separator chamber <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> through the liquid outlet valve <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the liquid outlet valve <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> remains closed until the predetermined pressure differential between liquid in the de-swirl chamber <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and liquid in the accumulator/separator chamber <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is attained. There is no external control of opening the liquid outlet <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. The predetermined pressure differential is dependent on the load selected for the control springs <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. A worker skilled in the art would understand that the load selected for the control springs <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> could be changed to satisfy application specific requirements. </paragraph>
