<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> (1) Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a broadcast apparatus, a reception apparatus, and a data transmission/reception method, and especially relates to techniques of multiplex, transmission, and reception of data to be simultaneously displayed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> (2) Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In recent digital broadcasting, additional data such as character information is multiplexed with program data such as video and audio and broadcast. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In general, the same or update additional data is repeatedly multiplexed with program data and broadcast, in a predetermined cycle such as five seconds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> After a viewer&apos;s start operation, a reception apparatus keeps the viewer waiting while the reception apparatus waits for necessary additional data for one or two cycles, processes it, and displays it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Also, in a virtual interactive system in which a viewer repeatedly select items from displayed menus to search for necessary information, they have to wait in every selection operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A reception apparatus that provides desired information to a viewer shortly after the viewer&apos;s selection operation is disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. H10-126753. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> This reception apparatus receives navigation information which associates a plurality of pieces of image information with each other, and accumulates a piece of image information to be displayed next in a memory in advance. Accordingly, the reception apparatus intends to reduce a waiting time from the viewer&apos;s selection operation to the display of the desired image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Here, if additional data to be multiplexed with program data is different for each program like characters or detailed information about a program, which are to be displayed simultaneously with an image of the program, additional data changes when one program changes to another. Therefore, a viewer has to wait until the reception apparatus starts to display additional data whenever one program changes to another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Suppose there is a waiting time of seven seconds. The waiting time of seven seconds is not so problematic for a relatively long program of thirty minutes or one hour. However, the shorter a broadcast time period of a program becomes, the greater the influence with the waiting time becomes. Especially, a broadcast time period of a commercial (CM) is generally no longer than thirty seconds. In addition, a CM program has to meet a lot of requirements from its sponsor. Therefore, it is problematic if characters are not displayed even for a few seconds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Note here that conventional reception apparatuses are not designed to handle such a problem caused when one program changes to another. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> &lt;Overview&gt;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> The preferred embodiment of the present invention relates to a data transmission/reception system including the following broadcast apparatus and reception apparatus. The broadcast apparatus multiplexes program data of a program to be reproduced by a reception apparatus and additional data for characters to be displayed with the program, and broadcasts them. The reception apparatus receives the program data and the additional data and displays them together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> Here, the broadcast apparatus multiplexes program data with additional data, from before the start of a CM program to the end of the CM program. The broadcast apparatus also multiplexes the program data with an instruction to accumulate the additional data, before the start of the CM program. The broadcast apparatus further multiplexes the program data with an instruction to display characters with the CM program, after the start of the CM program. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> The reception apparatus accumulates the additional data before the start of the CM program, and displays the characters with the CM program using the accumulated additional data after the CM program starts, in accordance with the multiplexed instructions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> With this construction, the characters can be displayed with the CM program from the start of the CM program, without delay. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment, in order to reduce the load of multiplexing operations, a main program is multiplexed with its additional data only from the start of the main program to a multiplex start time for additional data of a program to be broadcast immediately after the main program (such a thing is hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;succeeding&rdquo; one). If there is no succeeding program or if there is no additional data corresponding to the succeeding program, the main program is multiplexed with its additional data from the start to the end of the main program. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> A multiplex start time for additional data of a CM program varies depending on whether a main program or another CM program is broadcast immediately before the CM program. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> Specifically, when another CM program is broadcast immediately before the CM program (such a thing is hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;preceding&rdquo; one), the broadcast apparatus starts multiplexing for the CM program additional data, at the start of the preceding CM program. On the other hand, when a main program is broadcast immediately before the CM program, the broadcast apparatus starts the multiplexing operation for the CM program additional data a predetermined time period before the start of the CM program. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> Also, in this embodiment, a broadcast bandwidth is fixed. So, a broadcast bandwidth for additional data of one program is the same as a broadcast bandwidth for additional data of a plurality of programs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> &lt;Construction&gt;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a construction of a data broadcast system related to the present embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> The data broadcast system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is roughly made up of a broadcast apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and a reception apparatus <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> The broadcast apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is equipped in a broadcasting station or the like to broadcast program data and additional data. This broadcast apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a main data holding unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a CM data holding unit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a broadcast schedule holding unit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, a program data organizing unit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, an additional data organizing unit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, a multiplexing unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, a modulating unit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, and a transmitting unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> The main data holding unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> holds program data of a plurality of main programs and additional data of the plurality of main programs in correspondence. Here, the main programs refer to relatively long programs of several tens of minutes to several hours. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> It is assumed here that the main data holding unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> holds main program data A to Z (MP A to Z in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, their management codes are &ldquo;M1001&rdquo; to &ldquo;M1026&rdquo;) of main programs A to Z, and main program additional data A to Z (MPA A to Z in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, their management codes are &ldquo;MA1001&rdquo; to &ldquo;MA1026&rdquo;) of the main programs A to Z. The program data of each program is divided so as to allow CM programs to be inserted. For example, the main program data A is divided into main program data A-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of a main program A-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and main program data A-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of a main program A-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (MP A-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and MP A-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, their management codes are &ldquo;M1001-1&rdquo; and &ldquo;M1001-2&rdquo;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> The CM data holding unit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> holds program data of a plurality of CM programs and additional data of the plurality of CM programs in correspondence. Here, the CM programs refer to relatively short programs of several tens of seconds to several minutes. They are inserted between main programs and broadcast. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> It is assumed here that the CM data holding unit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> holds CM program data A to Z (CM A to Z in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, their management codes are &ldquo;C1001&rdquo; to &ldquo;C1026&rdquo;,) of CM programs A to Z and CM additional data A to Z (CMA A to Z in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, their management codes are &ldquo;CA1001&rdquo; to &ldquo;CA1026&rdquo;) of the CM programs A to Z. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> The broadcast schedule holding unit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> holds a broadcast schedule of programs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows an example program broadcast schedule held in the broadcast schedule holding unit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the program broadcast schedule shows a broadcast date, a channel code, a broadcast start time, a broadcast end time, a program management code, a program title, an additional data management code, and an additional data title. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows the transmission timing of data which is broadcast by the broadcast apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The vertical direction represents time, with the passage of time being shown from top to bottom. The horizontal direction represents bandwidths. As illustrated, the bandwidth of program data broadcasting and the bandwidth of additional data broadcasting are constant in predetermined bandwidths. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> Here, although instruction broadcasting is performed intermittently, the total bandwidth for the additional data broadcasting and the instruction broadcasting is assumed to be constant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> A bandwidth is defined by the number of transmitted bits per unit time (bit rate), and a predetermined bandwidth refers to a bandwidth allocated for each broadcast stream of program data and additional data of each channel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> The broadcast apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> multiplexes program data of a main or CM program with its additional data and instructions to the reception apparatus <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and broadcasts them at the transmission timing shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> The program data organizing unit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> organizes program data made up of video and audio data. The program data organizing unit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> includes an EDPS (Electronic Data Processing System) which organizes program data of a long period of several weeks, and a DS (Data Server) which organizes program data of a short period of several days. According to the program broadcast schedule held in the broadcast schedule holding unit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the program data organizing unit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> acquires program data of a main program scheduled to be broadcast in a time period from the main data holding unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, acquires program data of a CM program scheduled to be broadcast in the same time period from the CM data holding unit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and inserts the CM program data within the main program data so as to organize program data in which the main and CM program data is arranged in the scheduled broadcast order. Such program data organized by the program data organizing unit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is hereinafter called &ldquo;complete program data&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0204" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0204&rsqb;</number> The additional data organizing unit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> organizes additional data corresponding to each program. The additional data organizing unit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> includes a data broadcast organizing server. The additional data organizing unit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> acquires additional data (sub additional data) corresponding to each part of complete program data (sub program data), which shows continuous contents, from the main data holding unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the CM data holding unit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The sub program data here is sub program data of a main program or sub program data of a CM program. The sub program data of the main program is a part of the program data of the main program, which is obtained when the sub program data of the CM program is inserted. In other words, the sub program data of the main program is program data which is broadcast from the broadcast start time of the main program data or the broadcast end time of the preceding CM program data to the broadcast end time of the main program data or the broadcast start time of the succeeding CM program data. The sub program data of the CM program is the CM program data itself. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0205" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0205&rsqb;</number> The multiplexing unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> generates multiplexed data by multiplexing the complete program data organized by the program data organizing unit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, with the additional data organized by the additional data organizing unit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and instructions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows a detailed construction of the multiplexing unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> included in the broadcast apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the multiplexing unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> includes a broadcast pattern searching unit <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, an additional data combining unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a cache instruction generating unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, a display instruction generating unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, a preceding multiplexing unit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, and a simultaneous multiplexing unit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0208" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0208&rsqb;</number> The broadcast pattern searching unit <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> searches the complete program data organized by the program data organizing unit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, for (a) a first pattern in which sub program data of a CM program is followed by sub program data of another CM program and (b) a second pattern in which sub program data of a main program is followed by sub program data of a CM program. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the broadcast pattern searching unit <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> finds the first pattern in <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, and the second pattern in <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0209" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0209&rsqb;</number> The additional data combining unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> generates combined sub additional data by combining sub additional data of a CM program to be broadcast earlier in a first pattern and sub additional data of a CM program to be broadcast later in the first pattern, in a distinguishable state, when the broadcast pattern searching unit <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> finds a first pattern. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, for example, the additional data combining unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> combines the CM additional data A an B, the CM additional data B and G, the CM additional data A and B, the CM additional data B and H, the CM additional data A and B, and the CM additional data B and F, for the first pattern pairs <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, respectively. Here, the additional data combining unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may generate combined sub additional data of three or more sets of sub additional data by combining combined sub additional data and sub additional data, or combining combined sub additional data and combined sub additional data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0210" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0210&rsqb;</number> The cache instruction generating unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> generates a cache instruction to instruct the reception apparatus <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to accumulate (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;to cache&rdquo;) sub additional data before the broadcast start time of its corresponding sub program data. More specifically, the cache instruction generating unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> generates a cache instruction to instruct the reception apparatus <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to cache the sub additional data, which is included in combined sub additional data and is not to be broadcast immediately. The cache instruction generating unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> also generates a cache instruction to instruct the reception apparatus <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to cache sub additional data of a CM program to be broadcast later in a second pattern when the broadcast pattern searching unit <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> finds a second pattern, which is to be broadcast after a main program, when the broadcast pattern searching unit <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> finds a second pattern. The cache instruction may define the timing of caching of specified sub additional data, as when the reception apparatus <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> receives it or when a timer of the reception apparatus <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> recognizes a specified execution time. It is assumed here that the reception apparatus <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is to cache sub additional data upon receiving it. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, for example, the cache instruction generating unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> generates instructions to cache the CM additional data B (its management code CA1002), the CM additional data G (its management code CA1007), the CM additional data H (its management code CA1008), the CM additional data F (its management code CA1006), and the CM additional data A (its management code CA1001). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0211" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0211&rsqb;</number> The display instruction generating unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> generates a display instruction to instruct the reception apparatus <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to display characters with sub program data using its sub additional data during a reproduction time period of the sub program data. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, for example, the display instruction generating unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> generates instructions to display the CM additional data A (its management code CA1001), the CM additional data B (its management code CA1002), the CM additional data G (its management code CA1007), the main program additional data A (its management code MA1001), the CM additional data H (its management code CA1008), and the CM additional data F (its management code CA1007). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0212" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0212&rsqb;</number> The preceding multiplexing unit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> repeatedly multiplexes, during the broadcast time period of sub program data of a CM program to be broadcast earlier in each first pattern (e.g. <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>), this sub program data with combined sub additional data generated by the additional data combining unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a display instruction for sub additional data corresponding to the sub program data to be broadcast earlier in the first pattern, and a cache instruction for sub additional data corresponding to sub program data to be broadcast later in the first pattern. This multiplexing is performed so that the total bandwidth for the combined sub additional data, the display instruction, and the cache instruction is a predetermined bandwidth. Also, the preceding multiplexing unit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> repeatedly multiplexes, during a predetermined time period before the broadcast end time of sub program data of a main program to be broadcast earlier in each second pattern (e.g. <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>), this sub program data with sub additional data corresponding to sub program data of a CM program to be broadcast later in the second pattern and a cache instruction for the sub additional data of the CM program. This multiplexing is also performed so that the total bandwidth for the sub additional data and the cache instruction is the predetermined bandwidth. Specifically, in the time period <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> (from 6:13:00 to 6:13:30), the preceding multiplexing unit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> repeatedly multiplexes the CM program data A with combined sub additional data which is made up of the CM additional data A and B, a display instruction for the CM additional data A, and a cache instruction for the CM additional data B, on the predetermined bandwidth in total. In the time period <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> (from 6:13:30 to 6:14:00), the preceding multiplexing unit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> repeatedly multiplexes the CM program data B with combined sub additional data which is made up of the CM additional data B and H, a display instruction for the CM additional data B, and a cache instruction for the CM additional data H, on the predetermined bandwidth in total. In the time period <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> (from 6:12:40 to 6:13:00), namely in the last twenty seconds of the broadcast time period of the main program data A-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the preceding multiplexing unit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> repeatedly multiplexes the CM additional data A with a cache instruction for the CM additional data A, on the predetermined bandwidth in total. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0272" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0272&rsqb;</number> In this way, according to this embodiment, from before the start of a CM program to the end of the CM program, the broadcast apparatus multiplexes program data with additional data, a cache instruction to cache the additional data before the start of the CM program, and a display instruction to display characters with the CM program after the start of the CM program, and the broadcast apparatus then broadcasts them. In addition, according to the multiplexed instructions, the reception apparatus caches the additional data before the start of the CM program and display the characters with the CM program using the cached additional data after the start of the CM program. Accordingly, the reception apparatus can display the characters to be displayed with the CM program in time for the start of the CM program. That is, the reception apparatus does not keep viewers waiting for display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0273" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0273&rsqb;</number> Here, although additional data refers to characters to be displayed with a program in this embodiment, any kind of data to be simultaneously used with a program such as still video data, moving video data, audio data, and other operating instructions to a reception apparatus may be replaced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0274" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0274&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, additional data of a main program starts to be multiplexed with program data of the main program at the start of the main program. This is based on an assumption that a broadcast time period of a main program is so long that no inconvenience will result if characters included in the additional data are not displayed with the program data for several seconds at the start of the main program due to a waiting time in which the additional data is received, processed and displayed. Also, in this embodiment, additional data of a main program is stopped being multiplexed with program data of the main program at a multiplex start time for additional data of the succeeding program. This is based on an assumption that a broadcast time period of a main program is so long that no inconvenience will result if characters included in the additional data are not presented with the program data to a user who only starts to receive the data for the last several seconds at the end of the main program. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0275" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0275&rsqb;</number> These can simplify multiplexing operations and reduce the load of them. However, multiplexing for additional data of a main program may be performed in the same way as that for additional data of a CM program. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0276" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0276&rsqb;</number> Also, the predetermined time period need not be determined in advance. The time period may be determined by an indication by an outside. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0277" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0277&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in this embodiment, a multiplex start time for additional data of a CM program varies depending on whether the preceding program is a CM program or a main program in order to simplify multiplexing operations for continuous CM programs and reduce the load of them. However, the multiplex start time may be fixed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0278" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0278&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in this embodiment, a multiplex start time for additional data varies depending on whether the additional data is for a CM program or a main program. However, it may vary depending on whether a display time period of sub program data is longer than a predetermined criterion time period. In this case, the multiplexing unit further includes a broadcast time period judging unit which judges a time period in which sub program data is displayed by a reception apparatus is longer than a predetermined criterion time period. When the broadcast time period judging unit judges that the display time period of the sub program data is no longer than the predetermined criterion time period, the sub additional data is treated in the same way as that of a CM program in this embodiment; otherwise, in the same way as that of a main program in this embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0279" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0279&rsqb;</number> Additionally, although additional data is always multiplexed with program data in this embodiment, additional data may be multiplexed not with program data but only with an instruction to the reception apparatus at each transmission time determined based on a reproduction start time of the additional data, and broadcast. In this case, the transmission timing of the sub additional data may vary depending on whether a reproduction time period of the sub additional data is longer than a predetermined criterion time period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0280" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0280&rsqb;</number> Also, a criterion for showing a threshold value of a broadcast time period of the preceding program in order to determine a multiplex start time for additional data (hereinafter called &ldquo;first criterion&rdquo;) may differ from a criterion for showing a threshold value of a broadcast time period of a program in order to judge whether characters may not be displayed for several seconds at the start and the end of the broadcast time period (hereinafter called &ldquo;second criterion&rdquo;). In this case, the multiplexing unit further includes (a) a short program judging unit which judges whether a display time period in which video is reproduced by the reception apparatus using sub program data is no longer than a predetermined first criterion and (b) a long program judging unit which judges whether the display time period is longer than a predetermined second criterion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0281" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0281&rsqb;</number> Sub additional data may be updated during a broadcast time period of its corresponding sub program data. In this case, a multiplex start time for additional data varies depending on a broadcast time period of the preceding program in this embodiment. However, the multiplex start time may vary depending on a time period from the most recent update time of the preceding additional data corresponding to the preceding program data to the end of the preceding program. In this embodiment, characters are not displayed for several seconds at the start and the end of a program when a broadcast time period of the program is long enough. However, it may be assumed that characters are not displayed for several seconds at the start of a program when a time period from the start of the program to the first update time of additional data of the program is long enough. Also, it may be assumed that characters are not displayed for several seconds at the end of a program when a time period from the last update time of additional data of the program to the end of the program is long enough. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0282" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0282&rsqb;</number> The first criterion and the second criterion depend on a time period of a broadcast cycle of sub additional data. Therefore, the broadcast apparatus may further include a criterion determining unit which determines a first criterion to be used by the short program judging unit and a second criterion to be used by the long program judging unit, by multiplying the time period of a broadcast cycle of sub additional data by each predetermined coefficient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0283" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0283&rsqb;</number> The first criterion may be determined not by a broadcast time period of a program but by an indication by an outside. For example, a user may determine whether a multiplex start time for additional data is before or at the start of a program and instruct the broadcast apparatus to follow that. In the same way, a user may determine whether additional data continue to be subjected to multiplex until the start of the succeeding program and instruct the broadcast apparatus to follow that. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0284" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0284&rsqb;</number> Although a predetermined bandwidth is allocated for additional data broadcasting and instruction broadcasting in total in this embodiment, the bandwidth need not be fixed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0285" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0285&rsqb;</number> For example, a total bandwidth for multiplexed data is not allocated to a predetermined bandwidth. Instead, the total bandwidth may be increased by adding a bandwidth for additional data which is additionally multiplexed to the predetermined bandwidth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0286" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0286&rsqb;</number> The caching unit may perform caching by accumulating additional data, which is being broadcast by radio broadcasting, such as satellite broadcasting and terrestrial broadcasting, or cable broadcasting, such as cable television broadcasting and internet broadcasting, (a) in a storage medium connected to a reception apparatus, such as a hard disc drive, a recordable compact disc drive, a rewritable compact disc drive, an magnet-optical disc drive, a recordable DVD drive, a rewritable DVD drive, a DVD-RAM drive, a floppy disc drive, a memory card, or (b) in a storage medium included in a reception apparatus, such as a hard disc and a main memory. Also, the caching unit may perform caching by copying additional data, which is stored in the above storage medium or which is prestored in a storage medium of a supplement to a magazine, to a high-speed processing memory, such as an on-board cache memory and an on-chip cache memory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0287" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0287&rsqb;</number> Additionally, computer programs to have a computer perform the processing of the above embodiment may be recorded on computer-readable recording media to be distributed or transferred through internet and sold. These recording media can be, for instance, a floppy disc, a compact disc, a recordable compact disc, a rewritable compact disc, a magnet-optical disc, a recordable DVD disc, a rewritable DVD disc, a DVD-RAM, and a memory card, all of which allow the user to load into and remove from a computer. The recording media may be also a hard disk, a semiconductor memory, or the like that are provided in a computer in advance. The recording media are not limited to the above ones. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0288" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0288&rsqb;</number> Although the present invention has been fully described by way of examples with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Therefore, unless such changes and modifications depart from the scope of the present invention, they should be construed as being included therein. </paragraph>

<claim-text>(a) in a first case where the broadcast time period of the first program data is shorter than the predetermined criterion time period and the broadcast time period of the second program data is no shorter than the predetermined criterion time period, repeatedly multiplexing the second additional data with the second program data until a specific time, repeatedly multiplexing the first additional data with the second program data from the specific time to a start of the broadcast time period of the first program data, and repeatedly multiplexing the first additional data with the first program data during the broadcast time period of the first program data, the specific time being a point in time before the start of the broadcast time period of the first program data, and a time period between the specific time and the start of the broadcast time period of the first program data being a predetermined time period, </claim-text>
<claim-text>(b) in a second case where the broadcast time period of the first program data and the broadcast time period of the second program data are each shorter than the predetermined criterion time period, repeatedly multiplexing the second additional data and the first additional data with the second program data from the specific time to the start of the broadcast time period of the first program data and repeatedly multiplexing the first additional data with the first program data during the broadcast time period of the first program data, and </claim-text>
<claim-text>(c) in a third case where the broadcast time period of the first program data is no shorter than the predetermined criterion time period, regardless of whether the broadcast time period of the second program data is shorter than the predetermined criterion time period, repeatedly multiplexing the second additional data with the second program data until the start of the broadcast time period of the first program data and repeatedly multiplexing the first additional data with the first program data during the broadcast time period of the first program data; and </claim-text>
</claim-text>
<claim-text>a broadcasting step for broadcasting the data multiplexed in the multiplexing step. </claim-text>
