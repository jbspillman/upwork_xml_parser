<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to radiation therapy treatment and more particularly to a system and method for providing such treatment. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Radiotherapy devices are generally used for the treatment of patients. A radiation therapy device usually comprises a gantry which can be swiveled around a horizontal axis of rotation in the course of a therapeutic treatment. A linear accelerator is located in the gantry for generating a high energy radiation beam for therapy. This high energy radiation beam can be an electron radiation or photon x-ray beam. During treatment, this radiation beam is trained on a zone of a patient lying on the isocenter of the gantry rotation. The delivery of radiation by a radiation therapy device is prescribed and approved by an oncologist. Actual operation of the radiation equipment, however, is normally done by a therapist. When the therapist administers the actual delivery of the radiation treatment as prescribed by the oncologist, the radiation emitting device is programmed to deliver the specific treatment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Typically, in such a system, the oncologist has a clear understanding of the particular type of treatment that is desired. For example, if it is a prostate cancer treatment, the oncologist will be an expert in that type of cancer treatment and will provide the appropriate treatment plan. Similarly, if the cancer is a breast cancer, then the oncologist that has sufficient knowledge about that type of cancer will provide the treatment regarding that type of cancer. However, in those instances where an expert is not available, it is possible that the patient may not receive the kind of treatment that can aggressively treat a particular type of problem. Particularly in areas that are undeveloped, i.e., third world countries, where experts are not available, it would be desirable to be able to provide the best possible treatment plan for a particular type of cancer. Accordingly, what is desired is a system allowing for a radiation therapy treatment where an expert is not available to provide the particular treatment plan. The system should be easy to use, adaptable, and compatible with existing radiotherapy equipment. The present invention addresses such a need. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to radiation therapy treatment and more particularly to a system and method for providing such treatment. The following description is presented to enable one of ordinary skill in the art to make and use the invention and is provided in the context of a patent application and its requirements. Various modifications to the preferred embodiment and the generic principles and features described herein will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. Thus, the present invention is not intended to be limited to the embodiment shown but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and features described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Turning now to the drawings and, with particular attention to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> radiation treatment apparatus embodying the present invention is shown therein and generally identified by reference numeral <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The radiation treatment apparatus <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is configured to vary the synchronization of the RF modulator pulse and the injector pulse, as will be discussed in greater detail below. The radiation treatment apparatus <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> includes a beam shielding device (not shown) within a treatment head <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, a control unit in a housing <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and a treatment unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> according to the present invention. The radiation treatment device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> includes a gantry <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> which can be swiveled around a horizontal axis of rotation <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> in the course of a therapeutic treatment. The treatment head <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is fastened to the projection of the gantry <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. A linear accelerator is located in the gantry <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to generate the high powered radiation required for the therapy. The axis of the radiation bundle emitted from the linear accelerator and the gantry <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is designated by <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Electron, photon or any other detectable radiation can be used for the therapy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> During the treatment, the radiation beam is trained on a zone <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of an object <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, for example, a patient who is to be treated and who lies at the isocenter of the gantry rotation. The rotational axis <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the gantry <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the rotational axis <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of a treatment table <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and the beam axis <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> intersect in the isocenter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The plates or leaves of the beam shielding device within the treatment head <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are substantially impervious to the emitted radiation. The collimator leaves or plates are mounted between the radiation source and the patient in order to delimit the field. Areas of the body, for example, healthy tissue, are therefore subject to as little radiation as possible and preferably to none at all. The plates or leaves are moveable such that the distribution of radiation over the field need not be uniform (one region can be given a higher dose than another). Furthermore, the gantry can be rotated so as to allow different beam angles and radiation distributions without having to move the patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The radiation treatment device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> also includes a central treatment processing or control unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> which is typically located apart from the radiation treatment device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The radiation treatment device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is normally located in a different room to protect the therapist from radiation. The treatment unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> includes output devices such as at least one visual display unit or monitor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and an input device such as a keyboard <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Data can be input also through data carriers such as data storage devices or a verification and recording or automatic setup system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The treatment processing unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is typically operated by the therapist who administers actual delivery of radiation treatment as prescribed by an oncologist by using the keyboard <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> or other input device. The therapist enters into the control unit of the treatment unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> the data that defines the radiation dose to be delivered to the patient, for example, according to the prescription of the oncologist. The program can also be input via another input device, such as a data storage device. Various data can be displayed before and during the treatment on the screen of the monitor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Typically in this type of system, the oncologist will be an expert who has a full knowledge of how a treatment plan should be administered. However, in many instances the oncologist may not have the latest information regarding a particular treatment of a particular type of cancer. For example, if the patient is in an undeveloped country where there is not easy access to a physician or oncologist that has the requisite knowledge, the treatment provided by the oncologist might not be adequate or possible. Accordingly, a system and method in accordance with the present invention allows one to develop a treatment plan based on information retrieved from the treatment unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> To more fully describe the features of the present invention, refer now to the following discussion in conjunction with the accompanying figures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates a hardware environment used to implement the present invention. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, in the preferred embodiment the present invention is implemented in a server computer (&ldquo;server&rdquo;) <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The server <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> could be part of the treatment unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) or could be a separate unit. The server <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> generally includes, a processor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, a memory <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> such as a random access memory (RAM), a data storage device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> (e.g., hard drive, floppy disk drive, CD-ROM disk drive, etc.), a data communication device <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> (e.g., modem, network interface device, etc.), a monitor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> (e.g., CRT, LCD display, etc.), a pointing device <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> (e.g., a mouse, a track ball, a pad or any other device responsive to touch, etc.) and a keyboard <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. It is envisioned that attached to the computer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be other devices such as read only memory (ROM), a video card drive, printers, peripheral devices including local and wide area network interface devices, etc. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that any combination of the above system components may be used to configure the server <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The server <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> operates under the control of an operating system (&ldquo;OS&rdquo;) <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, such as MVS&trade;, AIX&trade;, UNIX&trade;, OS/2&trade;, WINDOWS&trade;, WINDOWS NT&trade;, etc., which typically, is loaded into the memory <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> during the server <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> startup (boot-up) sequence after power-on or reset. In operation, the OS <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> controls the execution by the server <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of computer programs <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, including server and/or client-server programs. Alternatively, a system and method in accordance with the present invention may be implemented with any one or all of the computer programs <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> embedded in the OS <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> itself without departing from the scope of the invention. Preferably, however, the client programs are separate from the server programs and are not resident on the server. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The OS <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and the computer programs <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> each comprise computer readable instructions which, in general, are tangibly embodied in or are readable from a media such as the memory <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, the data storage device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and/or the data communications device <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. When executed by the server <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the instructions cause the server <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to perform the steps necessary to implement the present invention. Thus, the present invention may be implemented as a method, apparatus, or an article of manufacture (a computer-readable media or device) using programming and/or engineering techniques to produce software, hardware, firmware, or any combination thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The server <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is typically used as a part of an information search and retrieval system capable of receiving, retrieving and/or disseminating information over the Internet, or any other network environment. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that this system may include more than one of server <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In the information search and retrieval system, such as a digital library system, a client program communicates with the server <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> by, inter alia, issuing to the server search requests and queries. The server <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> then responds by providing the requested information. The digital library system is typically implemented using a database management system software (DBMS) <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> such as the DB2&trade; by IBM Corporation. The DBMS <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> receives and responds to search and retrieval requests and termed queries from the client. In the preferred embodiment, the DBMS <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is server-resident. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Objects are typically stored in a relational database connected to an object server, and the information about the objects is stored in a relational database connected to a library server, wherein the server program(s) operate in conjunction with the (DBMS) <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to first store the objects and then to retrieve the objects. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the foregoing is an exemplary configuration of a system which embodies the present invention, and that other system configurations may be used without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, a system and method in accordance with the present invention allows for the appropriate treatment plan to be provided via the server based on information within the server or accessed by the server. To more fully describe this feature, refer now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a flow chart illustrating a system and method in accordance with the present invention. In a preferred embodiment, a treatment wizard would be initiated for radiation therapy, via step <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. Next, it is determined if demographic information is within the system, via step <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. If there is no patient demographic information in the system, then the data must be entered into the system, via step <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. The information can be placed in the system either via a manual entry or via an electronic patient record system, via step <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. Next, it is determined what disease needs to be treated, via step <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. The appropriate treatment protocol is then provided, based upon the patient identifying information and the disease to be treated, via step <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The appropriate treatment protocol could be implemented in a variety of ways depending upon the protocol used. For example, Siemens Corporation provides treatment protocols from its centers of excellence (COE) for a variety of diseases (such as prostate cancer, breast cancer, head and neck cancer, etc.) To illustrate the treatment protocol providing step <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> in more detail, refer now to the following discussion conjunction with the accompanying figure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a flow chart which illustrates providing the appropriate treatment protocol in accordance with the present invention. First a wizard is initiated for treating a particular disease (for example, prostate cancer), via step <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. Next, a determination is made as to which protocol will be provided, via step <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. Any number of protocols (COE &num;1-COE &num;n) could be provided based upon the COE&apos;s capability. In the case of a prostate cancer treatment, a CT of the patient will be taken, the target tumors will then be outlined and a treatment plan will be provided, via step <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. Next, it will be determined if the plan has been approved, via step <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>. If the plan has not been approved, then a new plan is provided, via step <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. Once the plan is approved, then quality checks are performed, via step <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Next, the target is treated a predetermined number of times (for example, 25 times), via step <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. Steps <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> are duplicated from the appropriate COE protocol to provide the patient with the most effective treatment. Accordingly, the user of the system does not have to be an expert in the field to provide this treatment based upon the COE. Thereafter, a determination is made whether the treatment is finished, via step <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. If the treatment is not finished, return to step <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. If the treatment is finished, then end treatment wizard. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, through the present invention a treatment plan could be provided based upon a protocol in a database within the server. In addition, the database can be updated on a regular basis through access to the Internet, intranet, or other types of input to insure that the particular treatment plan provided is the most up-to-date treatment plan for the disease to be treated. In so doing, a system is provided that can be used in settings where experts are not available. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the treatment plan is implemented by a &ldquo;wizard&rdquo; which would allow the user to input information in response to queries via the user interface to provide the optimum treatment. A system and method in accordance with the present invention could allow for certain queries to provide access to a private network, public network, or intranet which could provide access to additional information that would improve the treatment plan. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Therefore, better treatment can be provided in those situations which will enhance the quality of care for a particular patient. This system could be utilized with any type of radiation therapy treatment, including prostate cancer, breast cancer, and any other types of radiation treatment plans to insure that the patient receives the optimum care. Accordingly, what is provided is a system and method for improving the care for an individual when receiving radiation treatment. Through the ability to obtain the most current information about treating a particular type of disease, it is possible for an individual, where an expert is not available, to provide a high quality of care through access to such information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The system can be easily implemented on existing equipment and it is cost-effective and relatively inexpensive to implement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Although the present invention has been described in accordance with the embodiments shown, one of ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize that there could be variations to the embodiments and those variations would be within the spirit and scope of the present invention. Accordingly, many modifications may be made by one of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
