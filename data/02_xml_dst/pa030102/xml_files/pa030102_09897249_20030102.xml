<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The invention relates to a quadrature demodulating radio receiver and to a method for reducing an imbalance in gain between an in-phase channel and a quadrature channel of such a radio receiver. Received radio frequency signals are downconverted to in-phase and quadrature-phase signals, either to a baseband or a certain IF frequency. In order to improve the performance of the channels, it is proposed that imbalances in gain or amplitude between the two channels are compensated in the analog domain. This is achieved by employing in at least one of the channels amplifying means with an adjustable gain for amplifying received signals in the analog domain, the adjustable gain being controlled according to a detected imbalance in gain. The invention moreover relates to an equivalently designed radio transmitter and a corresponding method. The invention equally relates to components and communications systems including such a radio receiver or transmitter, and to a transconductance mixer for such a radio receiver or transmitter. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a radio receiver for demodulating quadrature (IQ) modulated radio frequency signals, and to a corresponding radio transmitter. The invention moreover relates to a transconductance mixer for such a radio receiver or transmitter, and to a base station, a mobile station and a radio communications system comprising such a radio receiver or transmitter. The invention equally relates to a method for reducing an IQ gain imbalance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Radio receivers are known from the state of the art, for example for receiving radio frequency signals in mobile stations or base stations of a radio communications system, which radio frequency signals were transmitted by some radio transmitter of the radio communications system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> If a quadrature modulation is employed in a communications system for transmitting signals, a radio transmitter modulates the in-phase (I) and the quadrature-phase (Q) signal components of local oscillator signals that are phase offset by 90 degrees. The two modulated carrier signals are then superposed for transmission. For quadrature demodulation, the radio receiver then has to provide two separate channels. The modulated signal is downconverted/demodulated using signals provided by a local oscillator that are again 90 degrees phase shifted to each other to produce either quadrature baseband or quadrature IF (intermediate frequency) signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> For illustration, a block diagram of a conventional direct conversion radio receiver is depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In this radio receiver, a receiving antenna <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is connected via a bandpass filter <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to a low-noise amplifier (LNA) <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The output of the LNA <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is connected on the one hand to an I-channel <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the radio receiver and on the other hand to a Q-channel <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the radio receiver, both channels being referred to also simply as quadrature channels. In both quadrature channels <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, a mixer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, a channel selection filter <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, a variable gain amplifier (VGA) <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and an analog-to-digital (A/D) converter <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> are cascaded. The outputs of both channels <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are connected to digital signal processing units which are not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. A local oscillator <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is further connected to the mixer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in the I-channel <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and via a 90&deg; phase shifter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to the mixer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in the Q-channel <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the radio receiver. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Radio frequency signals are received via the receiving antenna <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The received signals are then bandpass filtered by the bandpass filter <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and amplified by the LNA <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> before being fed in parallel to both, I-channel <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and Q-channel <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the radio receiver. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In each of the two quadrature channels <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the signals are first processed by the respective mixer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, in order to obtain the in-phase and the quadrature component of the received signal by mixing it with a suitable high frequency signal. In the mixer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the I-channel <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the received signal is mixed for downconversion with a high frequency signal received directly from the local oscillator <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the output of the mixer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> constituting the in-phase component of the received signal. In the mixer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the Q-channel <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the received signal is mixed for downconversion with the high frequency signal received from the local oscillator <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> via the 90&deg; phase shifter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the output of this mixer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> thus constituting the quadrature component of a signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In both quadrature channels <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the signals output by the respective mixer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> pass the respective channel selection filter <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, by which a desired channel is filtered out. Subsequently, the selected channel is amplified in both channels <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> with an adjustable gain by the respective VGA <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and converted into a digital signal by the respective analog-to-digital converter <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. The output of both analog-to-digital converters <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is then fed to the digital signal processor for further processing in the digital domain. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Since the original signal is processed on two separate channels <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> for regaining the in-phase and the quadrature component, a different gain may be applied by the respective channel <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to the signal. In case the demodulation is carried out at radio frequency, usually most of the gain imbalance result from the mixers <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, since devices used at high frequencies cannot be implemented to match as well as those used at baseband frequencies. The problem of gain imbalance occurs also with integrated radio receivers, even though integrated components can be realized with lower tolerances that match in principle very well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In known digital receivers, I/Q gain imbalance is compensated only if needed in the digital back-end after the analog signal processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The effects due to the mismatch between the two quadrature channels is particularly severe in receivers which employ a non-zero intermediate frequency after quadrature downconversion because of the high image rejection requirements (IRR) for such receivers. However, a large error between the channels can also cause problems in a direct conversion architecture. In direct conversion receivers, the intermediate frequency is zero, and thus there is no image frequency. However, some image rejection is still required due to the overlap of the signal sidebands in the downconversion process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Error might occur, when the typically high noise from the active channel selection filters becomes &ldquo;visible&rdquo; in one of the quadrature channels after a gain drop in the respective other quadrature channel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Noise figure is a number used to characterize the quality of a circuit or a channel. It tells the decrease in signal to noise ratios between the input and output in decibels. Imbalance in the noise figures between the channels reshape the constellation of the received signal and thus deteriorate the Bit-Error-Rate (BER). If the required receiver noise figure is low, there is typically not much headroom for additional performance tolerances. Even a small gain mismatch can increase the noise figure of one of the quadrature channels. In a properly implemented integrated circuit, the gain error between the two quadrature channels is typically about 0.5 dB without compensation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> This problem cannot be solved with digital signal processing by compensating for a gain imbalance after the noise figure of one of the quadrature channels has been increased too much. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Similar problems may occur in a radio transmitter. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the invention to enable a reduction of gain imbalances between the I- and the Q-channel of a radio receiver employing IQ demodulation and of a radio transmitter employing IQ modulation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> It is also an object of the invention to improve the performance on the quadrature channels of a radio receiver employing IQ demodulation and of a radio transmitter employing IQ modulation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> On the one hand, a radio receiver comprising an I-channel and a Q-channel is proposed, said channels being provided in parallel at a respective input with quadrature modulated radio frequency signals. In the I-channel, a first mixer is arranged. The mixer includes a switching/multiplying stage for downconverting a radio frequency signal fed to said in-phase channel to an in-phase component of the signal. A switching/multiplying stage is suited to perform a downconversion of radio frequency signals to an IF or to a baseband. In the quadrature channel, a second mixer is arranged. The second mixer includes a switching/multiplying stage for downconverting the radio frequency signal fed to said quadrature channel to a quadrature component of the signal. In addition, amplifying means are arranged in at least one of said I-channel and said Q-channel for amplifying signals in the analog domain with an adjustable gain. Detecting means are further employed in the radio receiver for detecting an imbalance in gain between at least part of said in-phase channel, said part including said first mixer, and of a corresponding part of said quadrature channel, said corresponding part including said second mixer. Finally, the proposed radio receiver comprises controlling means for controlling the adjustable gain of said amplifying means in a way that a detected imbalance in gain is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Equally proposed are a mobile station for a radio communications system, a base station for a radio communications system and a radio communications system including such a radio receiver. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Moreover, a transconductance mixer for a radio receiver is proposed comprising the amplifying means for amplifying radio frequency signals with an adjustable gain, means for downconverting radio frequency signals amplified by said amplifying means, and controlling means for controlling said adjustable gain according to the proposed radio receiver. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Further, a corresponding method for reducing an imbalance in gain between the I- and Q-channels of a quadrature demodulating radio receiver is proposed. The method comprises in a first step feeding quadrature modulated radio frequency signals in parallel to said I-channel and to said Q-channel of said radio receiver. Then, the radio frequency signals are downconverted to an in-phase component of the received signal in the I-channel and to a quadrature component of the received signal in the Q-channel. Before or after downconversion, the signals are amplified in the analog domain in at least one of said I- and said Q-channels with an adjustable gain. The proposed method further includes determining whether there exists currently an imbalance in gain between at least a part of said in-phase channel and a corresponding part of said quadrature channel, which parts respectively include the downconversion of radio frequency signals. The adjustable gain with which signals are amplified at least in one of the in-phase and the quadrature channels can then be controlled in a way that a detected imbalance in gain is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, a radio transmitter is proposed. The radio transmitter comprises an I-channel to an input of which in-phase components of a signal are fed and a Q-channel to an input of which quadrature-phase components of said signal are fed. A first mixer is arranged in the I-channel, which first mixer comprises a switching/multiplying stage for upconverting received in-phase components of signals to a radio frequency signal. A second mixer is arranged in the Q-channel, which second mixer comprises a switching/multiplying stage for upconverting received quadrature-phase components of signals to a radio frequency signal. The radio transmitter further includes amplifying means arranged in at least one of the I-channel and the Q-channel for amplifying signals in the analog domain with an adjustable gain. Detecting means are employed for detecting an imbalance in gain between at least part of the I-channel, said part including the first mixer, and of a corresponding part of the Q-channel, said corresponding part including the second mixer. Finally, controlling means are provided for controlling the gain of the amplifying means in a way that detected imbalances in gain are reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As for the radio receiver, also for the radio transmitter a corresponding transconductance mixer, a corresponding mobile station, a corresponding base station, a corresponding communications network, and a corresponding method are proposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The invention proceeds from the idea that gain or amplitude imbalances between the I- and the Q-channels of a radio receiver or transmitter can be compensated in the analog domain. The compensation is achieved for the radio receiver by controlling the adjustable gain of amplifying means arranged in at least one of the two channels before means employed for converting the signals into the digital domain. The compensation is achieved for the radio transmitter by controlling the adjustable gain of amplifying means arranged in at least one of the two channels after means for converting the components into the analog domain. With such methods, such a radio receiver and such a radio transmitter, a sufficient gain balance can be achieved and the IRR and Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) of the radio receiver or transmitter can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Preferred embodiments of the radio transmitter and the method for modulation of the invention correspond to the preferred embodiments of the radio receiver and the method for demodulation of the invention. Therefore, only preferred embodiments of the radio receiver of the invention will be mentioned in detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In a first preferred embodiment of a radio receiver, the amplifying means are arranged between the input and the mixer of at least one of the I- and the Q-channel for amplifying received radio frequency signals already before downconversion with an adjustable gain. When adjusting the signals&apos; amplitudes already before downconversion, it is possible to avoid imbalance in the noise figures of the two channels and to use a larger part of the dynamic range of the mixers and the analog-to-digital converters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The employed mixers are preferably transconductance mixers comprising in a first stage amplifying means and in a second stage downconversion means. The amplifying means of at least one of the transconductance mixers can then constitute the adjustable amplifying means provided in at least one of the quadrature channels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In a further preferred embodiment, adjustable amplifying means are provided in both channels before downconversion. Thus not only the gain in one of the I- or the Q-channel is adjustable by the controlling means, but both. The controlling means then advantageously always compensate detected gain imbalance by adjusting the adjustable gain of the amplifying means in the channel which currently has the lower gain, since typically, the signal in the channel with the lower gain has the higher noise figure. Thereby, not only a gain imbalance and a noise figure degradation is avoided, but additionally, the noise figure of the entire receiver can be enhanced equal to the noise figure of the better one of the two quadrature channels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Amplifying means with an adjustable gain in both channels can be realized most easily by using in both channels transconductance mixers with separately adjustable amplifying means in the respective first stage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In a further preferred embodiment of the invention, transconductance mixers realized as an integrated component are used as mixers. Such transconductance mixers can be realized in particular as integrated component including also the controlling means of the radio receiver of the invention. Advantageously, at least one of the amplifying means of the integrated transconductance mixers are then digitally controlled via the integrated controlling means. The entire radio receiver might be designed as integrated radio receiver. It equally is possible, though, to use discrete components and to control the amplifying means analogously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The adjustable amplifying means employed in one or both of the quadrature channels can for example comprise at least one transistor for amplification. The gain of the adjustable amplifying means is then controllable by adjusting the bias current of the transistor of said amplifying means. In one possible alternative, many amplifying elements are provided in one channel, which elements can be switched on/off separately in order to obtain a desired total gain. The amplifying element can be e.g. many parallel selectable (on/off) transconductance stages instead of one transconductance stage in a transconductance mixer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The detection of an imbalance of gain can be carried out either by analog or digital signal processing methods. In the analog domain, the detecting means can comprise in particular a power or a Vrms (Voltage root mean square) detector which detects the power of signals in both channels at some point after the respective downconversion. In the digital domain, the downconverted signals are evaluated for an imbalance in gain after being converted from analog into digital signals. The evaluation can be carried out by some common digital signal processing means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The controlling means can be realized as a current digital to analog converter (IDAC). Such an IDAC can be employed in particular for controlling the bias current of transistors used as adjustable amplifying means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The invention can be used in any image rejection architecture. It is of particular relevance for radio receivers that require a high image rejection ratio, e.g. a direct conversion radio receivers or radio receivers with quadrature branches at some intermediate frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The radio receiver can be either a pure radio receiver or a combined radio receiver/transmitter and be integrated in any suitable device. Such devices may be hand sets, radio links or low-cost base stations like pico base stations. The invention can be used for example, though not exclusively, for WCDMA base station applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In particular in a low noise figure direct conversion radio receiver in which the downconversion and analog baseband produce a significant amount of the total noise, an improvement of the noise figure and thus the dynamic performance can be achieved with the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Even though some preferred embodiments of the invention were presented, the invention is not restricted to these embodiments, but comprises any suitable other embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Other objects and features of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENTLY PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> A first embodiment of a radio receiver of the invention is illustrated by the block diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The block diagram represents an integrated direct conversion receiver that could be employed for example for WCDMA base station applications. In this first embodiment, the detection of an IQ gain imbalance is based on an analog signal processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The structure of the radio receiver corresponds to the structure of the receiver described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, wherein the mixers <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> are assumed to be transconductance mixers. Transconductance mixers are composed of two processing stages. In a first stage, a signal is received, converted from voltage mode to current mode, and amplified. Only in a second stage, the amplified signal is downconverted to an in-phase and a quadrature component of the received signal by mixing it with a suitable high frequency signal as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The structure of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is further supplemented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> with features of the invention. Only these supplemented features and their functions will be dealt with explicitly at this place. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The output of the variable gain amplifiers <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the I-channel <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the Q-channel <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the radio receiver are coupled by coupling means <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> to a common power detector <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The output of the power detector <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> in turn is connected to the input of controlling means <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, which controlling means <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> have a controlling access to the transconductance mixers <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in both quadrature channels <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and more specifically, to the amplifiers of the first stage of the transconductance mixers <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Signals received via the receiving antenna <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are processed by the radio receiver of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> just like signals received via the receiving antenna <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are processed by the radio receiver of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> A part of the signals leaving the respective variable gain amplifier <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of both quadrature channels <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is coupled by the coupling means <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> to the power detector <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> with the same coupling factor. The power detector <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> determines the gain difference &Dgr;A between the signals received via the coupling means <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> associated to the I-channel <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the signals received via the coupling means <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> associated to the Q-channel <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the radio receiver. Preferably, the noise power spectrum densities of the quadrature channels are compared in order to determine the gain difference &Dgr;A. That difference is equivalent to the respective amount of imbalance of gain between the two quadrature channels <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, since the power of the signals input to each channel <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is the same. Based on the determined gain difference &Dgr;A, the power detector <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> generates a digital signal indicative of the value by which the adjustable gain applied by the amplifier of the first stage of one of the transconductance mixers <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to received signals should be changed, in order to decrease the imbalance of gains. For determining the gain imbalance, a separate test signal or a received radio channel might be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The power detector <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> provides the generated signal to the controlling means <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. According to the digital input received from the power detector <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the controlling means <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> then adjust the gain of the amplifier of the first stage of one of the transconductance mixers <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. As consequence, the received signals are amplified by the transconductance mixers <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in a way that leads to an essentially equal gain on both of the quadrature channels <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> between the input to the respective channel <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the input to the respective analog-to-digital converter <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> It can be always the amplifier of the same transconductance mixer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> that is adjusted by the controlling means <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> in an appropriate direction by an appropriate value. Then only the gain of this amplifier has to be adjustable. Alternatively, however, the amplifier of the first stage of both transconductance mixers <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is adjustable, and it is always the amplifier of the transconductance mixer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in the channel <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> with the currently lower gain that is adjusted.

Moreover, a digital signal processor or processing unit DSP <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is shown, to which the outputs of both channels <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, of the radio receiver are connected. In addition to output terminals not shown, the digital signal processor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises an output connected to controlling means <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>.

The gain difference &Dgr;A between the signals leaving the I- and Q-channels <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the analog radio receiver can be determined for example by using EVM information. The gain difference &Dgr;A is again indicative of the respective gain imbalance between the quadrature channels <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The digital signal processor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> forwards control signals to the controlling means <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> that were determined based on the current imbalance of gain.
