<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">Improved methods for performing burn-in of electronic components, such as integrated circuits (ICs) with on-board thermal sense circuits, are used to obtain a higher bin split. According to one embodiment, a thermal set-point is loaded into each IC. While the ICs are maintained at a constant elevated temperature, the burn-in system checks each IC to determine whether the set-point has been exceeded. If so, it characterizes the IC by that set-point; if not, it decrements the set-point and checks again. The method continues until all ICs have been characterized to a specific set-point. As a result of the method, a junction temperature is obtained for each IC. In addition, a real-time estimate of the burn-in time for each IC is obtained, so that burn-in time can be adjusted to maximize burn-in throughput. Apparatus for implementing improved IC burn-in is also described. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to the field of electronics and, more particularly, to improved methods and apparatus for performing burn-in testing on electronic components such as integrated circuits. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In the field of electronic systems there is an incessant competitive pressure among manufacturers to drive the performance of their equipment up while driving down production costs. This is particularly true regarding the testing of integrated circuits (hereinafter &ldquo;ICs&rdquo;). ICs must generally be tested before they are incorporated into an electronic assembly in order to verify that each element on the IC functions properly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> It is well known to perform accelerated life testing on ICs to ensure that the ICs do not prematurely fail when they have been incorporated into higher levels of electronic packaging, such as a computer systems, (e.g., desktop, laptop, hand-held, server, etc.), wireless communications devices (e.g., cellular phones, cordless phones, pagers, etc.), computer-related peripherals (e.g., printers, scanners, monitors, etc.), entertainment devices (e.g., televisions, radios, stereos, tape and compact disc players, video cassette recorders, MP3 (Motion Picture Experts Group, Audio Layer 3) players, etc.), and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A goal of burn-in is to provide infant-mortality screening of ICs for reliability defects. By operating the ICs at increased voltage and/or temperature levels, while stimulating as many transistors on the ICs as possible, ICs that might fail prematurely are identified early and pulled out prior to shipment to customers. It is desirable to keep burn-in time (BITM) to a minimum to reduce production costs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> As high performance ICs are packed with increasing numbers of transistors numbering in the millions, the transistor channel length L<highlight><subscript>e </subscript></highlight>has been made increasingly shorter to improve performance. Generally, the shorter the channel length L<highlight><subscript>e </subscript></highlight>the higher the leakage current I<highlight><subscript>SB</subscript></highlight>. As the leakage current I<highlight><subscript>SB </subscript></highlight>increases, so does the corresponding power requirement, and the attendant heat dissipation. Thus, testing large quantities of ICs can require substantial consumption of electrical power resources, even as such resources become increasingly scarce and costly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is desirable to thoroughly test ICs undergoing burn-in testing while at the same time minimizing the cost, time, and complexity of such testing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> For the reasons stated above, and for other reasons stated below which will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon reading and understanding the present specification, there is a significant need in the art for improved IC burn-in methods and apparatus.</paragraph>

Bin split can be improved by adjusting the burn-in conditions to limit yield loss that results from thermal run-away. Further, a real-time estimate of the burn-in time for each IC is obtained, so that burn-in time can be adjusted in real-time to maximize burn-in throughput. Various embodiments are illustrated and described herein, including methods of testing and binning, as well as an IC having an interface circuit to a burn-in system, an IC burn-in system, and a computer-readable medium comprising computer instructions for instructing a processor to perform a method of binning a plurality of ICs each having a thermal sense circuit. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> IC <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> also comprises suitable interface circuitry <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> between internal bus <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and test fixture bus <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, to transmit data, instructions, and/or control signals between IC <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and burn-in system <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a simplified view of several electronic components <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> mounted on a burn-in test fixture <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. Test board or test fixture <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> comprises a plurality of sockets or connectors (not shown) to which one or more electronic components <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are coupled. In one embodiment, electronic components <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are ICs; however, in other embodiments electronic components can be virtually any other type of electronic or electrical device that generates heat in operation. Examples include cellular phones, pagers, computers of all types, electric tools, appliances, entertainment equipment, aerospace and vehicular components, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Test fixture <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> comprises a bus <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) to which electronic components <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are electrically connected to burn-in system <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a simplified view of test fixtures <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> in a burn-in oven <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. Burn-in test fixtures <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> are situated within an environmentally controlled chamber containing a temperature-altering mechanism, such as a heater and/or a chiller. In one embodiment, the chamber is heated; however, in another embodiment, the chamber could be chilled. Burn-in system <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, operating under the control of a human operator or of computer instructions, thermally stresses the electronic components <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> on test fixtures <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> by, for example, elevating the temperature in burn-in oven <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment wherein the electronic components <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> being burned-in are ICs, in addition to being heat-stressed they are typically subjected to higher operating voltages. The burn-in voltage varies according to the type of IC and the process used to fabricate it. For example, a burn-in voltage of 2.1 volts is used for one current processor IC product. In addition to increasing the operating voltage, it is desirable to toggle most if not all of the circuit nodes within the ICs during the burn-in period </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Thus, while burn-in test fixtures <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> are inside burn-in oven <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, they are functionally connected to burn-in system <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) via a network of connectors and wires (not shown) in order to operate the ICs on test fixtures <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> at elevated operating voltage and to toggle as many circuit nodes as possible on the ICs. Burn-in oven <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can also include power and clock circuits (not shown) to provide power and clock signals to the ICs undergoing burn-in. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference> together illustrate a flow diagram of an improved method <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> of testing an IC comprising a plurality of circuits or electronic devices, in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. A first one of the electronic devices provides a temperature indication, and this device can be any suitable thermal sense device, such as thermal sense circuitry <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). An optional, second one of the electronic devices stores a temperature value, and this device can be implemented by any suitable memory storage device, such as memory circuit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). If the optional, second memory storage device is not on the IC, the memory storage function can be performed by suitable memory storage within burn-in system <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, a temperature value is stored for the IC, either in the second electronic device or in a burn-in system coupled to the IC. A temperature value above the highest expected junction temperature of the IC is chosen. For example, in one burn-in embodiment, a temperature value of approximately 110 degrees C. is initially stored. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>, the IC is thermally stressed by elevating or lowering its ambient temperature. For burning-in ICs, the temperature is raised, e.g. to 60 degrees C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>, the first electronic device (e.g. a temperature sensing diode) provides a temperature indication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>, a determination is made whether the temperature indication matches the stored temperature value. &ldquo;Match&rdquo; means having the same value or substantially the same value. If there is a match, the method goes to <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>; otherwise, it goes to <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Determining Junction Temperature Tj for Each Component </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The present invention can determine a junction temperature Tj for each IC undergoing a burn-in test. Making use of a temperature indication generated by thermal sense device on-board each IC, the burn-in system initially stores a temperature value above the highest expected junction temperature Tj for the group of ICs undergoing test. By successively comparing the temperature indication output by the thermal sense device of each IC and decrementing the temperature value in successive steps of a degree or two, eventually a match, corresponding to the junction temperature Tj, will be made and recorded for each IC in the group of ICs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The junction temperature Tj of an IC can be represented by Equation (1) as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>T</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>j</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&equals;T</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>a</subscript></highlight>&plus;(&thgr;<highlight><subscript>ja</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&times;P</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>d</subscript></highlight>) &emsp;&emsp;Equation (1) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> wherein T<highlight><subscript>j</subscript></highlight>&equals; junction temperature (in degrees C.); </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> T<highlight><subscript>a</subscript></highlight>&equals;ambient temperature (in degrees C.); </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> &thgr;<highlight><subscript>ja</subscript></highlight>&equals;the junction-to-ambient thermal resistance (in degrees C./watt), which can be in the range of <highlight><bold>0.4-2.0 </bold></highlight>C./watt for some current processor products; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> P<highlight><subscript>d</subscript></highlight>&equals;power dissipation at T<highlight><subscript>j </subscript></highlight>(in watts), which can be in the range of 10-60 watts for some current processors products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> By obtaining a distribution of junction temps for all ICs undergoing burn-in testing, the present invention provides a direct assessment of the burn-in test stability. It also allows an IC manufacturer to substantially remove any thermal margin from burn-in testing by allowing parts having a shorter channel length, and/or parts operating at a higher power or frequency into burn-in testing. It also increases overall bin split, as will now be discussed immediately below. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Increasing Bin Split </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a relatively high bin split for electronic components undergoing thermal stress testing. &ldquo;Bin split&rdquo; is the process of evaluating a group of electronic components, such as ICs, to sort or allocate them into a number of different groups according to some characteristic. The characteristic could be, for example, a performance-related characteristic or an operational-related characteristic, such as standby current I<highlight><subscript>SB</subscript></highlight>. High performance processors generally operate at a higher I<highlight><subscript>SB </subscript></highlight>value (and a correspondingly higher junction temperature Tj) compared with lower performance processors of the same design running at the same clock speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In general, the higher the junction temperature Tj, the shorter the burn-in time BITM. However, if the burn-in conditions are set too high, the risk of thermal run-away increases. By obtaining a Tj for each component, the burn-in conditions can be set to maximize bin split and to limit yield loss that results from thermal run-away. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> In this invention, distribution of junction temps between the lowest performance processor and highest performance processor of a batch undergoing burn-in testing can be determined at a relatively fine increment, such as degree-by-degree from 110 degrees C. down to 60 degrees C. By obtaining a Tj value for each component, thermal margin is better understood, and transistor channel length L<highlight><subscript>E </subscript></highlight>can be retargeted (e.g. shortened) to obtain higher frequency bin split. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> How the present invention provides for a relatively high bin split will now be discussed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Each IC has an on-chip thermal sense circuit that provides T<highlight><subscript>j </subscript></highlight>for the IC. Ambient temperature T<highlight><subscript>a </subscript></highlight>is maintained constant in the burn-in oven, e.g. at 60 C. Burn-in voltage V<highlight><subscript>BI </subscript></highlight>is maintained constant during burn-in, e.g. V<highlight><subscript>BI</subscript></highlight>&equals;2.1 volts for one current processor product having a normal operating voltage of 1.7 volts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> An initial temperature value (e.g. 110 C.) is programmed for all ICs, and all ICs are checked to see whether any have a junction temperature indication T<highlight><subscript>j </subscript></highlight>of 110 C. Any ICs whose T<highlight><subscript>j </subscript></highlight>is 110 C. are identified. For each of these ICs, the ID and the 110 C. value are stored. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Next the temperature value is decremented to 109 C., and all ICs are again checked. Any ICs whose T<highlight><subscript>j </subscript></highlight>is 109 C. are identified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> This is continued down to a relatively low temperature, e.g. 60 C., and/or until a T<highlight><subscript>j </subscript></highlight>value has been logged for all ICs (excepting those that may have failed during burn-in testing). This continuous monitoring of Tj allows the burn-in conditions to be adjusted to minimize yield loss due to thermal run-away, and thus to improve bin split. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The ICs are binned according to their T<highlight><subscript>j </subscript></highlight>values. Those with the highest T<highlight><subscript>j </subscript></highlight>values are generally capable of highest performance. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Determining Burn-In Time (BITM) </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Burn-in testing to screen out infant-mortality failures by testing at elevated voltages and temps is performed for a specified length of time, referred to as the burn-in time BITM. BITM must be long enough in duration to provide satisfactory statistical and experiential assurance that most, if not all, of the failure-prone electronic components under test will have been identified. However, there is a practical upper limit to BITM duration, which is driven in part by high volume manufacturing costs (including labor costs and energy costs), by production throughput requirements, and by a potential decrease in product reliability in that the stresses applied during burn-in may adversely impact reliability once components are installed in customers&apos; products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The present invention can achieve significant savings in the burn-in test process by accurately determining the BITM for each component undergoing burn-in testing in the test fixture, as will now be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> BITM can be calculated from Equation (2): </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>BITM&equals;A</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>v</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>*A</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>T </subscript></highlight>&emsp;&emsp;Equation (2) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> wherein A<highlight><subscript>v </subscript></highlight>is a voltage acceleration factor. For one current processor product, A<highlight><subscript>v </subscript></highlight>is approximately 30. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> A<highlight><subscript>T </subscript></highlight>is a temperature acceleration factor that can vary within ICs of the same design. A<highlight><subscript>T </subscript></highlight>is derivable from the well-known Arrhenius relationship expressed in Equation (3): </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>A</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>T</subscript></highlight>&equals;exp &lsqb;(<highlight><italic>Ea/k</italic></highlight>) (1/<highlight><italic>T</italic></highlight>1&minus;1/<highlight><italic>T</italic></highlight>2)&rsqb;&emsp;&emsp;Equation (3) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> wherein Ea is an activation energy (in eV), typically in the range of <highlight><bold>0.3-2.0 </bold></highlight>eV; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> k is Bolzmann&apos;s constant&equals;8.617&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;5 </superscript></highlight>eV/K; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> T<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>is the intended use temperature for the IC (in degrees C.); and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> T<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is the burn-in temperature (in degrees C.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> A<highlight><subscript>T </subscript></highlight>is a function of power P<highlight><subscript>d </subscript></highlight>dissipated from the IC, and it can vary within ICs of the same design. P<highlight><subscript>d </subscript></highlight>is a function of standby current I<highlight><subscript>SB </subscript></highlight>to the IC, and it can vary within ICs of the same design. I<highlight><subscript>SB </subscript></highlight>is a function of transistor channel length L<highlight><subscript>E </subscript></highlight>and other process parameters, and it can vary within ICs of the same design. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Using the binning operation performed earlier, A<highlight><subscript>T </subscript></highlight>can be obtained for each IC, so BITM can be readily calculated in real time for each individual IC undergoing burn-in, using Equation (2) above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> As a result, the BITM can be dynamically varied. For example, BITM can be shortened or lengthened to correspond with the highest calculated BITM for any IC undergoing burn-in. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, BITM can be kept relatively constant, but certain test fixtures could be pulled from the burn-in oven early if all of their ICs have completed burn-in, and other test fixtures could be left in the burn-in oven longer, if some of their ICs require a longer than normal burn-in time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Thus, the burn-in test process can result in significant savings in labor, energy, and production time. It can also result in a significant increase in quality over a burn-in process that uses only a static BITM. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">Conclusion </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides improved methods for performing burn-in testing and/or binning of electronic components, such as ICs. By comparing a temperature indication provided by an on-board thermal sense circuit of each IC with a gradually decrementing thermal set-point value, all of the ICs can be characterized or binned according to a desired thermal parameter, such as junction temperature. By employing the burn-in testing concepts of the present invention, it is unnecessary to provide a unique test stimulus pattern to each component under test. The stimulus pattern can be the same for all components undergoing the burn-in test. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> A relatively high bin split is obtained, because burn-in conditions can be tuned to minimize thermal run-away loss. In addition, thermal margin based upon Tj can be removed to improve BITM, e.g. by increasing the ambient temperature T<highlight><subscript>a</subscript></highlight>. Further, a real-time estimate of the burn-in time for each IC is obtained, so that burn-in time can be adjusted to optimize burn-in throughput, and to reduce production costs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> In addition to the above-mentioned methods, an IC having an interface circuit to a burn-in system, an IC burn-in system, and a computer-readable medium comprising computer instructions for instructing a processor to perform a method of binning a plurality of ICs have been described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> As shown herein, the present invention can be implemented in a number of different embodiments. Other embodiments will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. The elements, architecture, functions, and sequence of operations can all be varied to suit particular product and test requirements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> For example, instead of recording the temperature value when a match occurs, the temperature indication could be recorded, because it is either identical to or substantially identical to the temperature value. Also, the components undergoing burn-in testing could be subjected to other environmental accelerators, such as humidity, vibration, thermal cycling, and so forth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Also, instead of storing a temperature value (e.g. initially a high value), comparing a temperature indication generated by a thermal sense unit on each IC with the temperature value, logging any matches, and then successively decrementing the temperature value until a Tj value has been recorded for all ICs, a slightly different implementation could be used in which a thermal set-point is loaded into each IC. While the ICs are maintained at a constant elevated temperature, the burn-in system checks each IC to determine whether the set-point has been exceeded. If so, it characterizes the component by that set-point; if not, it decrements the set-point and checks again. This process would continue until all ICs have been characterized to a specific set-point. As a result of the method, a junction temperature is obtained for each IC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The various elements depicted in the drawings are merely representational and are not drawn to scale. Certain proportions thereof may be exaggerated, while others may be minimized. The drawings are intended to illustrate various implementations of the invention, which can be understood and appropriately carried out by those of ordinary skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Although specific embodiments have been illustrated and described herein, it will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that any arrangement that is calculated to achieve the same purpose may be substituted for the specific embodiment shown. This application is intended to cover any adaptations or variations of the present invention. Therefore, it is manifestly intended that this invention be limited only by the claims and the equivalents thereof. </paragraph>
