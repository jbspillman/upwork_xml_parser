<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to scanning, and more particularly to adjusting the interpretation of scanned data based on automatic detection of physical characteristics of the scanned media. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Copiers, scanners, and other devices that scan images from source media and convert those images to data are common in business and home environments. A typical scanner scans one or more images from source media, converting those one or more images to data. A software program typically interprets that data and converts it to a data file for storage and use. Such a data file may be in GIF, JPEG, or other format. A copier typically scans one or more images from source media. A digital copier converts those one or more images to data and stores that data. That stored data is then interpreted by a controller or other device within the copier, and transmitted to a marking engine within the copier. The marking engine produces one or more copies of the image on destination media. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The source media used with a copier, scanner or other such device can be any media that can be placed onto a scanning surface. Such source media may include standard paper, bond paper, glossy paper, transparencies, photographs, and a number of other different kinds of media. The properties of the image data scanned from these different source media may vary according to the source media type. For example, image data scanned from a transparency often has blurry edges, as a result of the transparency of the source media. As another example, image data scanned from one side of thin or translucent source media having images printed on both sides may include undesired background material bleeding through the source media from the opposite side. To ameliorate these problems, copiers often include controls for varying the contrast or other properties of the copies printed on the destination media. However, to the extent these controls are effective, their use is a matter of trial and error for the operator, resulting in waste of destination media as well as user frustration. While scanners do not typically offer such controls, imaging software utilized with scanners typically includes such controls in software, where those controls relate to the display of the scanned data. These controls result in similar limitations and problems as described with regard to the copier controls. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A scanning device adjusts the interpretation of scanned data based on automatically-detected source media type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In one aspect of the invention, a device that scans an image from source media automatically detects the source media type being scanned. A sensor may detect the translucency of the media in order to determine the source media type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In another aspect of the invention, interpretation of scanned data may be automatically adjusted based on the source media type sensed. Such interpretation includes interpretation of scanned data within a copier before transmission to a marking engine, and interpretation of scanned data by a software program for conversion to a data file. In this way, the quality of the scanned data and the images produced from it can be improved by making adjustments appropriate to the source media type scanned. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> block diagram of one embodiment of a scanning device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is shown. The scanning device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be a standalone scanner adapted for connection to an information handling system, a portion of a copier, or any other device adapted to scan images from source media. The scanning device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes structures, mechanisms and/or software for scanning images from source media, and is standard to one of ordinary skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The scanning device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a window <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> on which source media <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> may be placed. The window <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is substantially clear, and allows the structures and/or mechanisms used for scanning images to view the source media <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> without the need to contact the source media <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> or expose those structures and/or mechanisms. The use of a window <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> on a scanning device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is standard in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The scanning device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a cover <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The cover <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may be connected to the scanning device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> via a hinge or other mechanism, such that the cover may be lifted away from the scanning device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> as needed. The cover <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is adapted to cover the window <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> when no source media <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is placed on the window <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and to substantially cover relatively thin source media <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> placed on the window <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the cover <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may be connected to, or may be a part of, a feeder device (not shown) that automatically feeds source media <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to be scanned onto the window <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Such a feeder device is standard to one skilled in the art, and may be of a type commonly utilized as a copier component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> light source <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is connected to the cover <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and positioned to face the window <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The light source <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may be mounted to the cover <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> in any manner that provides for a secure connection between them, and that substantially prevents the light source <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> from interfering with, damaging or being damaged by source media <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and/or the window <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The light source <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may be a light-emitting diode (LED), an incandescent light, or any other source of light. The light source <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is connected to a power supply (not shown) within the scanning device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to receive power to generate illumination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> A sensor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is provided within the scanning device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, behind the window <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The sensor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is positioned relative to the light source <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> such that the source media <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is interposed between them. Further, the sensor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and the light source <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are substantially aligned with one another, such that the light source <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is substantially directed toward the sensor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The sensor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is adapted to sense the particular frequency or frequencies of light emitted by the light source <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Thus, if the light source <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is an LED emitted light at a particular frequency, the sensor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is adapted to detect that frequency. The sensor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> may be a photoelectric cell, a charge-coupled device (CCD), or other device adapted to sense light. In one embodiment, the sensor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> outputs an analog electrical signal that corresponds to the light level that it senses. In another embodiment, the sensor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> outputs a digital electrical signal that corresponds to the light level it senses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The sensor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is electrically connected to a controller <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. The controller <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> may be a microprocessor, an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), or other device. Among other functions, the controller <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> processes information received from the sensor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. If the scanning device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is a component of another device, the controller <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> may pass information received from the sensor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to that other device. In another embodiment, if the scanning device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is a component of another device, the controller <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> may be omitted altogether, such that the sensor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> transmits analog and/or digital signals to an information processing component of that device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, another embodiment of the scanning device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is shown. This embodiment of the scanning device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is substantially the same as the first embodiment described above, except for the placement of the light source <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the sensor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the light source <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the sensor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> are both located within the scanning device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> on the same side of the window <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The light source <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the sensor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> are positioned relative to one another such that a portion of the light from the light source <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may be reflected from the source media <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to the sensor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the cover <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> has an interior surface facing the window <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> that is substantially white in color, and has substantially the same reflective properties over its entire surface. This interior surface of the cover <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> assists in reflecting into the sensor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> light that passes through the source media <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, as is described in greater detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Referring as well to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> method <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is shown for adjusting the interpretation of scanned data based on the type of source media scanned. In block <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, source media <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is received by the scanning device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the source media <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is placed in contact with the window <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> such that an image to be scanned from the source media <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> faces downward toward the window <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The cover <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may be lowered over the source media <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> if the source media <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is sufficiently thin. That is, if the source media <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is a sheet of paper or other thin media, the cover <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> can be closed onto it. If the source media <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is a book or other large object, the size of the source media <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> may prevent the cover <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> from closing over the source media <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In block <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, the source media <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is illuminated. Illumination is provided by the light source <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the light source <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may be switched on in block <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, then switched off when no longer needed in the method <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. However, the light source <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may remain illuminated for a longer period, if desired. For example, the light source <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may be illuminated at all times while the scanning device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is operational. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment of the scanning device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in which the light source <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is connected to the cover <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and positioned to face the window <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, the cover <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is closed over the source media <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the light source <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> illuminates the upper surface of the source media <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. A portion of that illumination travels through the source media <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. If the source media <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is opaque, that portion is zero. If the source media <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is transparent or translucent, that portion is greater than zero. The amount of illumination passing through the source media <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is related to the translucency of the source media <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, and thus to the type of the source media <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment of the scanning device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in which the light source <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is located within the scanning device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> on the same side of the window <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> as the sensor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, the cover <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is closed over the source media <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> if the source media <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is sufficiently thin. However, if the source media <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is large, such as a book or other bulky object, the cover <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> need not be closed. In this embodiment, the light source <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> illuminates the lower surface of the source media <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. A portion of that illumination is reflected from the source media <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The amount of illumination reflected from the source media <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is related to the type of source media <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, and is also related to the optical properties of the inner surface of the portion of the cover <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> from which illumination may be reflected. Reflection from the inner surface of the cover <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may occur where the source media <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is a transparency or other substantially transparent media, such that illumination travels through the source media <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, is reflected from a portion of the inner surface of the cover <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, then travels back through the source media <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In block <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, the resultant illumination received at the sensor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is measured. The illumination received at the sensor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is a result of the transmission of illumination through, or the reflection of illumination from, the source media <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The measurement of the resultant illumination at the sensor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> may be a measurement of the intensity of the illumination. Other characteristics of the resultant illumination may be measured in addition to, or instead of, the intensity of the illumination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In block <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, the media type is determined based on the characteristics of the resultant illumination measured by the sensor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The characteristics of this resultant illumination are related to the media type of the source media <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. For example, the characteristics of the resultant illumination will be different for transparencies, bond paper, photographic paper, and cardboard. In one embodiment, the controller <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> compares the characteristics of the resultant illumination measured by the sensor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to stored illumination data, to match the measured characteristics to a particular media type. In another embodiment, the controller <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> converts the characteristics of the resultant illumination to an index or other reference number relating to the translucency of the source media <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. In such an embodiment, determining the media type refers to determining the translucency of the source media <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The determination of media type may be stored in the controller <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> or in a memory storage device (not shown) connected to the controller <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, for later use. This information may be stored in another location or a different location in a device connected to the scanning device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, if desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In block <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, the source media <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is scanned. The scanning process, and the mechanisms to perform it, are standard to one of ordinary skill in the art. As a result of the scanning process, raw data is generated that represents an image present on the side of the source media <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> facing the window <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. This raw data may be received by the controller <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and stored in a memory storage unit (not shown) within the scanning device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, or may be received and stored at a location in a device connected to the scanning device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In block <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, interpretation of the raw data obtained in block <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> is adjusted based on the media type of the source media <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The raw data obtained in block <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> is interpreted by the controller <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> or other device in order to convert that raw data into a usable form. Such interpretation is standard to those of ordinary skill in the art. Interpretation of the raw data may include interpretation of the raw data before transmitting that data to a marking engine, interpretation of the raw data for conversion to a data file such as a JPEG file, or other types of interpretation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Adjustments to the interpretation of the raw data are made based on the media type of the source media <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. As an example, the media type of the source media <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> may be a transparency. Typically, the data that results from the scan of a transparency includes blurry edges, as a result of the transparent nature of the source media <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Because the media type was determined to be a transparency, the interpretation of the raw data is adjusted automatically to sharpen the edges of the scanned image, thereby compensating at least in part for scan defects resulting from the nature of the source media <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. As another example, the media type of the source media <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> may be thin glossy paper, such as a page of a magazine. Typically, the data that results from a scan of such thin glossy paper printed on both sides includes image artifacts from the side of the paper facing away from the window <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Because the media type was determined to be thin glossy paper, the interpretation of raw data is adjusted automatically to remove those image artifacts via a background removal process. Other adjustments may be made to these and other media types, in order to at least partially correct scan defects associated with the type of the scanned source media <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, instructions for implementing the method <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> are provided as a computer program product. A computer program product is a set of instructions for a device such as a controller <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. The computer program product may be stored in a memory storage device within or connected to the scanning device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The computer program product may be received into the scanning device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> or associated device via a communications network, a compact disc, a removable hard disk, a removable optical disk, flash memory, or any other hardware, network, device or method capable of storing and/or transmitting data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Although the invention has been described with reference to particular embodiments, the description is only an example of the invention&apos;s application and should not be taken as a limitation. Consequently, various adaptations and combinations of features of the embodiments disclosed are within the scope of the invention as defined by the following claims and their legal equivalents. </paragraph>
