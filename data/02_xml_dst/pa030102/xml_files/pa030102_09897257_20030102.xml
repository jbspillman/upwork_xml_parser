<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention is directed towards an apparatus and process for the selective engagement and release of a optical media disc such as a compact disc. The improved pick apparatus and operating process facilitates a rapid and accurate engagement of a single optical disc from a stack of discs and facilitates a transport of the engaged disc to a desired location, followed by the release of the disc. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Compact discs are plastic discs on which data may be recorded by a stamping process or a laser process in which binary information is stored by selectively burning small areas along circumferential tracks on the disc. Conventional compact discs are about 12 cm in diameter, although various sizes of discs are becoming more common. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Irrespective of size, blank media discs, including CD, CD-R, and video discs, all undergo a similar recording process. Such processes typically involve a CD transporter having multiple bins for holding a quantity of stacked CDs. A positioner is used to place a CD to a desired position or location where the CD may be burned, labeled, and otherwise manipulated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A variety of CD transport devices are known within the art as seen in reference to U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,734,629 and 5,919,918, assigned to Rimage Corporation, and which are incorporated herein by reference. The Rimage Corporation reference teaches a pick device in the form of a gripper having three expandable and contractable fingers for insertion into the center of a hole of the CD. The fingers expand and grasp the CD by its center hole for movement. The movement of the gripper fingers by controlled by a solenoid and computer processor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,946,216, assigned to Cedar Technologies, Inc., and incorporated herein by reference, discloses a CD transport mechanism which uses a picking device to move individual discs between the various bins and stations. The Cedar Technologies reference uses a rotating plate to engage three fingers inserted into the hub of a CD. The fingers, in response to movement of a circular pivot plate, provide a selective engagement and release of the CD. The operation of the pick design requires a number of inter-connected moving parts which adds to the complexity and cost of the pick. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 8,573, 692 to Costas, incorporated herein by reference, discloses an apparatus and method for picking up a single compact disc from a stack of compact discs. The pick device uses three vertical opposing members that may be independently moved to form a tapered triangular section. Upon engagement of all three arms with the hub ring of the CD, the uppermost CD may be moved by the withdrawal of the arms from the stack of CDs. The Costas reference teaches that the center arms are preferably formed of stainless steel and provides means of moving each of the three arms in an independent manner. Such an arrangement adds to the mechanical complexity and cost of the pick apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> While the above references represent advancements within the field of CD picks and automated systems for the manufacturing and recording of data on a CD, there remains room for variation and improvement in the art. In particular, there remains a need for a reliable CD pick which utilizes a minimum number of moving parts, may be constructed of low cost materials, and affords a high degree of reliability and maintenance-free operation. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Reference now will be made in detail to the embodiments of the invention, one or more examples of which are set forth below. Each example is provided by way of explanation of the invention, not limitation of the invention. In fact, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the present invention without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention. For instance, features illustrated or described as part of one embodiment, can be used on another embodiment to yield a still further embodiment. Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover such modifications and variations as come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents. Other objects, features, and aspects of the present invention are disclosed in the following detailed description. It is to be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the present discussion is a description of exemplary embodiments only and is not intended as limiting the broader aspects of the present invention, which broader aspects are embodied in the exemplary constructions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In describing the various figures herein, the same reference numbers are used throughout to describe the same material, apparatus or process pathway. To avoid redundancy, detailed descriptions of much of the apparatus once described in relation to a figure is not repeated in the descriptions of subsequent figures, although such apparatus or process is labeled with the same reference numbers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As best seen in reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> CD recorder and transporter <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is provided for recording optical media discs such as compact discs and video discs. The recorder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises at least one CD drive <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having a re-closable drawer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> for receiving a single CD thereon. The magazine <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, seen here as a three-pronged holder is adapted for housing a plurality of CDs <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, each CD <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> defining a central hub ring <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The CD transporter <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> further supports a spindle <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> for receiving in a sequential manner a supply of burned-in CDs. An overhead arm <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is used to position a pick <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> from a first location which operatively engages an uppermost CD <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> from the stack of CDs <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and positions the CD to a second location which is in alignment with the open CD drive <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Following recording of appropriate information on CD <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, arm <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and pick <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> will again engage the now recorded CD <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and transport the CD to a third location by placement and release of the CD onto spindle <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The movement of arm <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is controlled by an actuator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, actuator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> allowing movement of arm <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> along the length of rail <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Further, actuator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> provides rotational movement of arm <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> about rail <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Arm <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be attached to actuator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> along the pivot <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in a manner that will be described in more detail below. Rail <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is maintained in position by an &ldquo;L&rdquo;-shaped bracket formed by an upright <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and an overhead support member <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As seen in reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the CD handling equipment referenced above is mounted along an upper surface of a housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. An interior of housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> contains a microprocessor, key pad input, and conventional control systems as well known in the art to operate the CD drive and copying equipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In reference now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the arm <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is seen engaging an optical media pick <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Pick <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is mounted by its base <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to a surface of arm <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> using conventional attachment hardware such as threaded bolts. As better seen in reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>further defines a sleeve <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> which connects the base <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to a terminal tip <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. Pick <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> defines a first axial passage <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> extending from the base <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and through sleeve <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Hereafter, the passage narrows via a taper to a reduced diameter passage <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> which traverses a flat terminus <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of tip <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. Tip <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and sleeve <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> further defines a plurality of axial slits <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. Slits <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> are in communication with the interior passages <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Preferably, these slits <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> bisect the tip into at least two substantially equal halves. As illustrated in the preferred embodiment, the tip <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is divided into four substantially equal segments <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment seen in reference <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, tip <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> defines an outer tapered surface <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> to guide and align CD <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> that terminates along an upper end with a notch <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. Notch <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> defines a circumferential groove on the exterior of tip <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. An enlarged barb region <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is present along the opposite side of notch <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, barb <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> providing a stop mechanism when the tip is inserted into the hub of a CD. Reference lines &ldquo;D&rdquo; represent the diameter of the hub ring <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the aligned CD <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and as illustrated, the diameter of ring <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is slightly greater than the diameter of notch <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. An upper wall of barb <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> serves as a stop so as to maintain a desired position (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) in which the CD is substantially co-planer with the notch <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. As illustrated, an optional ring <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, such as a resilient &ldquo;O&rdquo;-ring, may be placed within the notch and has been found to offer improved performance of the pick. While the preferred embodiment of the tip <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and tapered surfaces <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are in reference to circular or conical structures, it is readily understood and appreciated by one having ordinary skill in the art that any geometric shape may be used which conforms to a similar shaped hub portion of a CD <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Pick <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> selectively engages and releases an individual CD <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> by an outward displacement of the segments <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, a plunger provided by a combination seen here as a pin <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and ball <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, is housed within the passage <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of the pick base and sleeve. In response to a solenoid <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, the pin <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is extended axially toward tip <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, thereby pressing ball <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> against the narrower, tapering walls of the upper portion of passage <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The diameter of ball <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> exceeds the diameter of passage <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and thereby the ball pressure displaces each segment <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> in a radial direction as indicated by the directional arrows in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The displacement places the notch <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and ring <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in engagement with the circular wall of hub <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, thereby securing the CD to the pick. The dimensions of notch <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> are such that only a single CD will be engaged. Further, the taper <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, beneath notch <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, facilitates the engagement of only a single CD from a stack of CDs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Pick <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, carrying CD <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> may be positioned to a desired second location. The CD is released from pick <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> by the disengagement of the solenoid-controlled pin. As a result, the release of pressure on ball <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> allows the segments <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> to return to their original position in which the CD is no longer engaged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Pick <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be constructed from plastic, nylon, or any similar material that maintains its flexibility over a large number of repeated flexing and expansion cycles. Further, the preferred materials of plastic or nylon are easily molded and/or cut to a desired shape. However, the pick <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is not limited in construction to solely these materials inasmuch as metals, composites, and combinations of materials maybe used to construct a pick which may operate in a similar manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;O&rdquo;-ring <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> has been found to improve the reliability of the engagement and the release of a CD from the notch <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. A resilient &ldquo;O&rdquo;-ring <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> provides a counteracting compressive force to the tip of pick <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, when the plunger is released from engagement with the interior passageways the &ldquo;O&rdquo;-ring helps restore the segments <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> to their original relaxed position. Similarly, the tapered surface <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of tip <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> has been found to facilitate the engagement of a CD hub. However, with the precise alignment of the pick to the reference CD, the profile of tip <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> could be provided by a non-tapered, cylindrical wall. Tip <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> could further define a round or arcuate surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> As seen in reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, arm <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be attached to actuator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> via a pivot attachment <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. This arrangement provides a useful control mechanism such that when arm <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and pick <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> engage a CD, arm <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> will pivot upwardly. A sensor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, such as a light sensor may be used to detect the upward movement of arm <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The sensor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> will signal actuator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> that arm <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and pick <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are in a proper position and thereby stops further movement along rail <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The signal from sensor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> will be used to further signal the required activation/deactivation of solenoid <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> so as to bring about the engagement or release of the reference CD. The control and regulation of pick <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be controlled through an electrical connection port <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) which allows for electrical interface to the autoloader unit&apos;s microprocessor based controller having appropriate software and hardware for regulating the CD controller cam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The use of a plunger to selectively expand a resilient tip of the pick affords a simple, economical and reliable apparatus which can be used in conjunction with a wide variety of commercial equipment. While the passages <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> defined within the interior of pick <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are seen as simple, tapered cylindrical passages, the shape of the passages could be varied. Similarly, the shape of the plunger and plunger tip could be varied if needed to facilitate the engagement and outward expansion of the tip segments. While the plunger is seen as a two-piece structure of a pin <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and ball <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, it is envisioned that a unitary plunger could be provided having a shaft portion and a terminal head, the head engaging walls of passage <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Upon disengagement of the plunger by the solenoid, the unitary plunger would be withdrawn and the flexible tip <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> will reassume initial configuration. </paragraph>
