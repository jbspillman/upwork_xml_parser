<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to flight path information systems and, more particularly, to flight path information assemblies, computer program products and methods for displaying flight path deviation information based on navigation system performance. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In modem commercial aircraft, a flight crew makes flight plan entries and modifications through a Flight Management System&mdash;Control Display Unit (FMS-CDU). The FMS-CDU is an electronic module containing a keyboard on its lower face half and an electronic display on its upper face half. By keying entries into the keyboard, the flight crew can build or modify a route into the Flight Management Computer by typing in a series of waypoints which are then displayed, in text form, on the upper half of the FMS-CDU display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> An additionally provided display is a navigation (map) display. In contrast to the text display of the FMS-CDU, the navigation display graphically depicts the selected waypoints along a desired route. Thus, as the flight crew types entries into the FMS-CDU, these are then displayed graphically on the navigation display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Current FMC&apos;s provide for construction of a variety of flight plans, consisting of dot-to-dot leg segments and procedural maneuvers. In addition, conventional FMC&apos;s provide an autopilot mode where the aircraft automatically flies according to a predefined flight plan by providing lateral navigation (LNAV) and vertical navigation (VNAV) guidance so that the route can be flown. Most commercial airliners can be flown on a constant heading with the autopilot engaged. This allows interception and tracking of a course outbound from a geographical waypoint. However, due to the effect of wind on the flight plan and other factors, the actual flight path flown by the aircraft often differs from the predefined flight plan, thus requiring constant adjustment to the airplane heading to maintain the desired course. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In order to facilitate adjustment of the airplane heading to maintain the desired course, many conventional FMC&apos;s are also capable of determining the position of the aircraft from navigation systems, such as GPS (Global Positioning System), ILS (Instrument Landing System), IRS (Inertial Reference System), VOR (VHF Omnidirectional radio Range) and DME (Distance Measuring Equipment). While these sources can provide adequate positioning information, they each have individual drawbacks. For example, while systems such as GPS systems, which acquire positioning information from satellites, can provide positioning information to an aircraft virtually anywhere, the availability of such satellite-based systems can be limited due to factors such as satellite geometry. And while ILS-type systems provide very accurate positioning information, these type systems are ground-based systems and are generally limited to landing procedures at major airports. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Due to the variances in the accuracy of many navigation systems, the United States and international aviation communities have adopted the Required Navigation Performance (RNP) process for defining aircraft performance when operating in enroute, approach and landing phases of flight. RNP is a probabilistic approach to evaluating an aircraft&apos;s deviation from its intended course, and has been defined by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) as &ldquo;a statement of the navigation performance accuracy necessary for operation within a defined airspace.&rdquo; Currently, several definitions of RNP standards exist, including Boeing RNP, Airbus RNP, RNP-10 and BRNAV/RNP-5. In this regard, according to the Boeing RNP, the navigation performance accuracy can be quantified by a distance in nautical miles, and a probability level of 95% laterally and 99.7% vertically. For example, an aircraft is qualified to operate in an RNP 1 lateral, RNP 250 vertical airspace if it can demonstrate that the capability and performance of the aircraft&apos;s navigation system will result in the aircraft being within 1 nmi (nautical miles) lateral of the indicated position on the navigation system at least 95% of the flying time, and within 250 feet vertical of the indicated position at least 99.7% of the flying time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Expanding upon the lateral navigation accuracy performance standard of 95%, the Boeing RNP defines a lateral integrity containment limit of twice the size of the RNP, centered on the aircraft&apos;s predefined path. The integrity containment limit further specifies that the navigation system must ensure the aircraft remains within the integrity containment boundary 99.999% of the flying time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Currently, to determine whether an aircraft is within the RNP or integrity containment limit, the FMC&apos;s calculate a real-time estimate of the navigation system accuracy, commonly referred to as the actual navigation performance (ANP). The ANP is typically calculated by the FMC based upon fault free performance and integrity statistics provided by the GPS receivers or the aircraft&apos;s geometry relative to ground based navigation aids, and assumptions on the navigation aid survey location error and performance characteristics. The ANP and RNP are then typically displayed on the FMS-CDU in numeric form along with a large amount of other numerics and text information relating to the intended flight path of the airplane. In order to determine whether the ANP is within the RNP, the display system provides for an &ldquo;UNABLE RNP&rdquo; alert when ANP exceeds RNP. This alert does not directly account for RNP changes due to the airplane deviating from the defined path. To account for this, the pilot or other crew member must look at the lateral path deviation displayed on the aircraft Navigation Display and the altitude displayed on the aircraft Primary Flight Display and attempt to determine if the deviation is acceptable for the selected RNP. This display and comparison method of determining whether the ANP is within the RNP requires an unnecessary amount of time, can be very distracting for the pilot and/or air crew member, and is only marginally adequate for low RNP values. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In light of the foregoing background, the present invention provides an assembly, computer program product and method for displaying navigation performance based flight path deviation information. The assembly, computer program product and method of the present invention provide pilots and/or air crew members with a clear, concise display of the dynamic relationship between ANP and RNP, intersecting flight paths and current actual flight path deviation from a predefined flight path. Also, whereas ILS guidance systems are generally limited to landing procedures at major airports, the assembly, computer program product and method of the present invention provide a deviation display operable for a wider range of airport procedures, including departures, arrivals and approach transitions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> According to one embodiment, a navigation performance based flight path deviation display assembly includes a display and a display processor capable of generating an image upon the display. The image includes at least one flight path scale comprising a reference point bounded by end markers extending in at least one of a lateral and vertical direction, such as the end markers extending equidistant laterally and/or vertically from the reference point on a respective flight path scale. The reference point relates to an actual flight path, and the end markers represent a required navigation performance (RNP). The display also includes at least one moveable deviation pointer disposed on the flight path scales, where the deviation pointer moves between the end markers based upon a deviation of the actual flight path of the aircraft relative to a predefined flight path. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the image includes a representation of at least one extendable navigation error disposed on the flight path scale, which defines at least one navigation performance suspect region. The representation extends from at least one of the end markers toward the reference point based upon the actual navigation performance (ANP) and the RNP for the aircraft, where the ANP and RNP are based upon a flight phase of the aircraft. In another embodiment, the representation is capable of identifying the at least one deviation pointer on the representation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, a flight path intersection display assembly comprises a display and a display processor capable of generating an image upon the display comprising the flight path scales and the deviation pointers. In addition, the image includes at least one moveable intersecting flight path pointer disposed on the flight path scales. The intersecting flight path pointers move in the area between the end markers based upon a distance of the intersecting flight path from the actual flight path. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In operation, the method for providing navigation performance based flight path deviation information begins by providing the flight path scales. Then, a deviation of the actual flight path of the aircraft relative to a predefined flight path is determined, and the moveable deviation pointers are thereafter displayed on the flight path scales based upon the deviation and the reference point. Next, an actual navigation performance (ANP) and the RNP are determined based upon a flight phase of the aircraft, and a representation of at least one extendable navigation error is thereafter displayed on the flight path scales based upon the ANP and RNP. In a further embodiment, deviation pointers on the representation are identified. In embodiments including the intersecting flight path pointers, after displaying the representation, at least one intersecting flight path is identified, and the moveable intersecting flight path pointers are thereafter displayed on the flight path scales based upon a distance of the intersecting flight path from the actual flight path. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The various embodiments of present invention therefore provide pilots and/or air crew members with a clear, concise display of the ANP as it relates to the RNP, intersecting flight paths and current actual flight path deviation from a predefined flight path. The non-distracting and intuitive display of the present invention also allows pilots and/or air crew members to readily determine in a timely manner whether the current navigation performance of the aircraft is within the required navigation performance.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The present invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which preferred embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates in both graphic and block diagram form the primary components of a modern commercial flight management system, indicated generally at 30. Although the present invention can be used with the modern commercial flight management system, as discussed below, it should be understood, however, that the present invention could be implemented any number of different electronic systems without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Shown at <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is a conventional aircraft navigational Flight Management System-Control Display Unit (FMS-CDU). The FMS-CDU includes an upper face portion <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and a lower face portion <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. In its upper face portion <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, the FMS-CDU <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> includes an electronic display <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> which is capable of displaying lines of text entered by the flight crew. These lines of text depict, typically, waypoints along the path of a desired navigational route. On both sides of and adjacent to the electronic display are line select keys, indicated generally at <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Upon the user activating one of the line select keys, the adjacent line of text on the electronic display is activated to thereby allow entry, selection or deletion of text. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> At the lower portion of the electronic display is scratch pad line <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> which displays system generated messages, entries via the keyboard (described below) and data being moved from one line to another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In the lower face half <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the FMS-CDU <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is a keyboard, indicated generally at <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The keyboard includes an array of keys as well as control inputs by which the flight crew can manually enter waypoints, which then appear on the electronic display <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> as text line items. Also included are various control keys which allow the flight crew to add, modify, and delete various entries. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> For example, a provided Execute key <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is a momentary action push button which becomes illuminated to indicate a modification to the active route. Upon the flight crew pushing the Execute key, a desired modification is activated and illumination of the key is extinguished. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> A provided Delete key <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is a momentary action switch which, when activated by the flight crew, enters DELETE in the scratch pad portion <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the electronic display <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. When the scratch pad is blank, a selection of a subsequent line by line select keys <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> deletes data on the corresponding adjacent line if such information is deletable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Thus, by way of typed entries via the keypad <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the flight crew enters waypoints along the desired navigational route. These waypoints are displayed as lines of text on the electronic display <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Also provided as a display to the flight crew of the desired navigational route is a navigational display (MAP) <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The navigation display depicts the current position of the aircraft, herein indicated by the triangle <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, and selected waypoints along the desired route such as the indicated waypoint &ldquo;VAMPS&rdquo; at <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, the next selected waypoint &ldquo;RUMOR&rdquo; at <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and the final waypoint &ldquo;ELN&rdquo; at <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In addition to the route information also depicted on the navigation display <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is the current magnetic track heading <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and an arcuate line <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> which depicts a portion of a compass rose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Also depicted in the upper left hand corner of the display <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is information indicating the current ground speed, true air speed, wind speed and wind heading information, collectively shown at <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The flight deck displays <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>, including the navigation display <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, and FMS-CDU <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> interconnect through a logic module indicated generally at <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. The logic module includes the flight management computer (FMC) <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. In addition, the logic includes the display processor or computer (display module) <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. Inputs from the logic module to and from the FMS-CDU <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are carried along a multiple buses <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, whereas display information from the display processor <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is carried to the flight deck displays via bus <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The flight management computer <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> provides lateral (LNAV) and vertical (VNAV) guidance signals to the autopilot flight director system (AFDS) <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>, which validates and acknowledges the guidance signals. The AFDS then provides guidance signals to the Primary Flight Computer (PFC) <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> which activates the aircraft&apos;s control surfaces <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> in the normal manner such that the aircraft is directed to automatically fly the route as selected by the flight management computer <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates a typical navigation arrangement as found in a modem commercial aircraft. Shown are left and right flight management computers (FMC&apos;s) <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, respectively. The left and right FMC&apos;s communicate with associated left and right control display units (CDU&apos;s) <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, respectively. The left and right CDU&apos;s are arranged for easy access by the pilots. As is often provided in modem commercial aircraft, a third, backup, or center channel CDU <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> may also provided. The third CDU is used in some aircraft, such as the <highlight><bold>777</bold></highlight> family of aircraft manufactured by The Boeing Compayn, to interface to other aircraft systems such as satellite communications, SATCOM, and/or the public address/cabin interphone system (PACI). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The CDU&apos;s <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and FMC&apos;s <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> communicate over a triple redundant data link or bus <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>A, B, C. The two FMC&apos;s also communicate over an FMC&apos;s intercabinet bus <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>, the function of which maintains synchronization of data states between the two FMC&apos;s. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In normal operation, one of the two FMC&apos;s <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> assumes primary control, here identified as left FMC <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Thus, outputs from FMC <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are provided both to the main instrument panel <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and to an autopilot flight director system <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. The main instrument panel includes left and right primary flight displays <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>, which are driven by left and right outputs from the autopilot flight director system <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. Left and right navigation displays <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>, respectively are driven by corresponding outputs from the primary FMC <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. A central engine and crew altering display <highlight><bold>149</bold></highlight> is also provided in the main instrument panel <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In the manner described with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, flight crew entries into the left and right CDU&apos;s <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> of desired flight plans are then transferred to the FMC&apos;s <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, with corresponding graphical depiction of the flight plans set forth on the left and right navigation displays <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Output navigation guidance signals for both vertical navigation VNAV and lateral navigation LNAV are provided from the primary FMC <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to the autopilot flight director system <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The autopilot flight director system <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> then produces corresponding output signals which pass to the primary flight computers <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. The primary flight computers, in turn, produce appropriate control signals which are applied to the aircraft&apos;s flight control surfaces <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> to cause the aircraft to fly in accordance with the flight crew entered flight plan in the CDU&apos;s <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference> are illustrative of a display, such as that produced by the display processor <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, according to the present invention and suitably comprises a display field presented on a cathode ray tube screen. Although the display can be produced by the display processor within the logic module <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, as discussed herein, it should be understood, however, that the display could be produced by any number of different electronic systems without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, and the more conventional components of the display, the display field is divided into a number of indicators or indicating areas <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> which are shaded to provide clear demarcation therebetween. A first area <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> comprises a centrally located electronic attitude director indicator which is substantially rectangular in shape having a central boresight box <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> representing the airplane longitudinal axis at the center of the box. On either side thereof are conventional, stationary aircraft symbols <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. An artificial horizon is provided by line <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> between an upper more lightly shaded area representing the sky and a lower darker area for ground shading. In addition, the lower portion of the attitude director indicator includes a digital readout <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> of the radio or (radar) altitude, which displays the current height of the aircraft above the ground. The overall presentation by the electronic attitude director indicator <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is substantially conventional. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Adjacent and along the left hand side of attitude director indicator <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is an air speed presentation <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> comprising a vertically oriented movable scale or &ldquo;tape&rdquo; having graduations representing air speed values along the right hand side thereof, i.e., on the side adjacent the attitude director indicator <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The air speed indicator further includes a fixed pointer <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> which points inwardly toward the air speed scale as well as toward the center of the attitude director indicator. The pointer is provided with a window <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> digitally indicating the air speed in response to instrumentation of the aircraft. As the air speed changes, the scale or tape moves vertically relative to the pointer <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> which continues to point toward boresight box <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. The tape presents a range of speed values above and below the current speed, e.g., between <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> knots in the particular illustration, with the numerics being disposed immediately to the left of the corresponding scale graduations. Portions of the scale or tape above and below the viewable range are blanked from the presentation. Moreover, the scale is blanked at the location of window <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> which supplies the numerical readout of the current speed as a &ldquo;rolling&rdquo; number. The scale right hand edge of the tape is not obscured by pointer <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> or window <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The air speed indicator further includes a pilot controlled marker or &ldquo;bug&rdquo; <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> consisting of a pointer, with the current value of the selected air speed (e.g., 250 knots) being numerically displayed at location <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> above the air speed presentation. When the selected air speed is attained, the marker or &ldquo;bug&rdquo; will reach pointer <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>. The marker <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> has a parked position at the upper end of the indicator <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and at the lower end of indicator <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> when the selected air speed is outside the values depicted by the air speed tape, and at such time only one of the horizontal markers will appear at the end of the tape. The air speed indicator may also include a guidance speed band <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> to indicate an allowable range of air speeds accompanying the VNAV and LNAV navigation guidance signals. In addition, the air speed indicator may include a reference target speed (REF) marker <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> along the indicator <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, and a selected landing flap position along with an associated reference speed (e.g., 30/120). Indicator <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> for aircraft heading comprises a raster-shaded area having the shape of a segment of a circle or compass rose which is easily comprehensible by the viewer. The indicator <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is provided with a degree scale along the upper, arc-shaped portion thereof adjacent attitude director indicator <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, and like the previously described indicator <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, the scale of heading indicator <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> moves with respect to a fixed pointer numbered <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight>. Below the fixed pointer, the indicator includes a track indicator <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> that moves as the track varies in relation to the heading. To the left of pointer <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> is a location <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> which digitally displays the present heading. For other than the segment of the heading display as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, the compass rose is blanked out, and is also blanked at location <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> where the numeric readout is presented. However, neither pointer nor window obscure the upper scale. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> A further, vertically disposed indicator <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is located adjacent the right hand side of attitude director indicator <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, and is provided with an altitude scale along the left hand side thereof, i.e., adjacent indicator <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The indicator <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is further provided with altitude numerics to the right of appropriate indicia on the scale. The indicator is of the moving scale or moving tape type wherein the scale moves with respect to fixed pointer <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> as the altitude of the aircraft changes, with the current value of the selected altitude being numerically displayed at location <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> above the air speed presentation. Fixed pointer <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> includes an adjacent window within which the correct altitude is digitally displayed in rolling number fashion. Thus, as altitude information from aircraft instrumentation changes, both the numerical indicia in window <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and the position of the underlying tape change accordingly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Altitude indicia for altitudes above and below the range depicted on the viewable scale or tape, here approximately eight hundred feet, are blanked, as is the scale beneath window <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. Pointer <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> and window <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> do not block the view of indicia along the left hand side of indicator <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, but points fixedly toward such indicia, and at the center of attitude director indicator <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The altitude indicator <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> further includes a marker or &ldquo;bug&rdquo; which is pilot positionable along the left hand side of the scale. A box-like marker or bug <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> having a centrally inwardly directed pointer <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> is pilot positionable along the left hand edge of the scale, with the arrow <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> pointing at a desired altitude in sliderule fashion. The digital readout at position <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> at the lower end of indicator <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> represents the barometric setting in inches of mercury. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The display of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference> also include a vertical speed indicator <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> calibrated in thousands of feet per minute along the left hand side thereof adjacent indicator <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. The shaded area comprising indicator <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is somewhat trapezoidal in shape, widening toward indicator <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, and is provided with a movable pointer <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> adapted to indicate the current vertical speed of the aircraft by pointing to the indicia of the scale along the left hand side of indicator <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. The last mentioned scale is fixed in position. Pointer <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is angularly movable from an apparent origin to the right of the scale, from which the pointer appears to extend radially outwardly. Not only does pointer <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> point to indicia along the left hand side of fixed vertical speed scale of indicator <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, it is also used to point toward a selected altitude on the altitude scale of indicator <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, here identified by the aforementioned marker or bug <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> After the pilot selects a desired altitude and marker <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> identifies the same, the vertical speed of the aircraft can be controlled so that pointer <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> points toward the selected altitude, and under these circumstances the vertical speed will be optimal for leveling out at the desired altitude. It will be seen that as the desired altitude is approached, and as the vertical speed of the airplane is controlled so that pointer <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> continues to point toward marker <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> while the latter moves downwardly, the vertical speed of the airplane will decrease or the airplane will decelerate in a vertical direction whereby the desired altitude will be attained in an optimized way. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> As an additional feature of the indicator <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, the vertical speed scale is expanded toward zero vertical speed to enhance proper deceleration toward the desired altitude. In a specific embodiment, the scale, compressed farther from the zero or center vertical speed index, is piecewise linear between indicia identified by numerics to the left of the indicia. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> It has been found advantageous, in respect to achieving a given change in altitude, that the vertical speed be approximately three times the change in altitude desired, at least for vertical speeds between zero and one thousand feet per minute. The relationship of the scale of indicator <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> to the scale of indicator <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is adapted to achieve this result as will be appreciated from comparing the scales. In coordinating the two scales, it is generally desirable that the altitude scale of indicator <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> be optimized in regard to indicia spacing for best pilot readability and performance, while the scale of indicator <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is adapted accordingly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The display of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference> also includes flight mode annunciator readouts <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> at the top center of the display. The three columns are reserved for autothrottle status, lateral mode status and vertical mode status. It is noted these annuciations are arranged in an order which associates the column content to the display feature in closest proximity. In particular, autothrottle mode is closest to the speed tape, vertical mode is closest to the altitude tape and lateral mode is in the center, relating to the bank scale or heading indicator. Flight director, autopilot and autoland status annuciations are displayed at location <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight> immediately above the attitude director indicator center, requiring a very short scan. In addition, location <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> may include characteristics of the approach, including station frequency and runway heading (in degrees), Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) readout in nautical miles and the current mode status. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Reference is now made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> and the navigation performance based flight path deviation and intersecting flight path information of the display. Although the navigation performance based flight path deviation and intersecting flight path information is described herein in conjunction with a conventional primary flight display, it should be understood that the navigation performance based flight path deviation and intersecting flight path information could be presented in any number of different manners without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Preferably located adjacent the bottom and right sides of the attitude director indicator <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, depending on the mode of the aircraft, the display includes flight path scales corresponding to the lateral and vertical flight paths of the aircraft. The lateral flight path scale, which is displayed when LNAV mode is active, includes a fixed reference point <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> representing the actual lateral flight path of the aircraft. The fixed reference point <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> is bounded by left <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> and right <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> end markers, which represent the Required Navigation Performance (RNP), discussed below. Whereas the reference point can be situated anywhere between the end markers, in a preferred embodiment the reference point is centered between the end markers, which then extend equidistant from the reference point. Similarly, the vertical flight path scale, which is displayed when VNAV mode is active, includes a fixed reference point <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> representing the actual vertical flight path of the aircraft. The fixed reference point <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> is bounded by top <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> and bottom <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> end markers which define the vertical RNP for the flight path of the aircraft. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Within the lateral flight path scale, the display includes a pilot and/or autopilot controlled marker or &ldquo;bug&rdquo; consisting of a lateral deviation pointer <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight>. The lateral deviation pointer represents the desired, predefined LNAV guidance flight path of the aircraft with respect to the actual lateral flight path. In this regard, the distance between the deviation pointer and the reference point represents the deviation of the aircraft with respect to the LNAV guidance flight path such that when the actual lateral flight path of the aircraft equals the LNAV flight path, the deviation will be zero. And when the deviation is zero, the deviation pointer will coincide with the reference point <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>. Similarly, within the vertical flight path scale, the display includes a pilot and/or autopilot controlled marker or &ldquo;bug&rdquo; consisting of a vertical deviation pointer <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight>. The vertical deviation pointer represents the desired, predefined VNAV guidance flight path of the aircraft with respect to the actual vertical flight path. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Also within the lateral flight path scale, the display includes a representation of at least one extendable navigation error <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>, hereinafter referred to as extendable bars. Although not illustrated, depending on the application and operation of the navigation system, the vertical flight path scale may similarly include vertical extendable bars. The lateral extendable bars extend from left <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> and right <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> end markers toward the reference point <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> of the lateral flight path scale based up on the current accuracy of the aircraft&apos;s navigation system (i.e., ANP) in relation to the RNP, as discussed below. The area within the extendable bars represents a navigation performance suspect region, while the area between the reference point and the extendable bars represents a confidence region <highlight><bold>276</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In addition to the extendable bars <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>, the lateral and vertical flight path scales may include lateral and vertical intersecting flight path pointers <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>274</bold></highlight>. The intersecting flight path pointers represent an intersecting flight path, such as an ILS path, within the RNP boundary of the end markers <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight>. The intersecting flight path pointers are moveable along the respective flight path scale based upon a distance of the intersecting flight path from the actual flight path. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> To provide a better understanding of the operation of the extendable bars <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>, reference is now made to FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. It should be noted, however, that while FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> illustrate only the lateral flight path scale and associated extendable bars, the display of the present invention can similarly include a vertical flight path scale and extendable bars without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Also, while RNP shall refer to the Boeing RNP definition, the present invention can be operated with any definition of RNP, including Airbus RNP, RNP-10 and BRNAV/RNP-5, without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>A, an aircraft can be defined from a predefined path <highlight><bold>276</bold></highlight> within an inner RNP limit <highlight><bold>278</bold></highlight> and an outer, integrity containment boundary limit <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight>. As stated, RNP defines the navigation performance accuracy necessary for aircraft operation within a defined airspace which, according to the Boeing RNP definition, requires an aircraft to be able to stay within the RNP limit 95% of the flight time for every mode of flight. The integrity containment boundary limit, which is typically only a lateral definition, is an additional requirement that is twice the size of the RNP limit, centered on the aircraft&apos;s predefined path. The integrity containment boundary limit specifies a safe separation distance between the aircraft and obstacle clearance when developing routes, areas and procedures. And according to the Boeing RNP definition, an aircraft must be able to stay within the integrity containment boundary limit 99.999% of the flight time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>B, the extendable bars <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> represent the current, real-time ANP in relation to the RNP for the current flight phase of the aircraft. In this regard, the extendable bars represent a navigation suspect area where the current ANP exceeds the RNP for the current flight phase of the aircraft. Similarly, the area between the extendable bars and the reference point <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> represents a confidence region <highlight><bold>276</bold></highlight>, representing an amount of allowable flight technical error (FTE), or total system error (TSE), relative to the current RNP. In the confidence region, in contrast to the suspect area, the ANP is below the current RNP. Because the ANP is dynamic and can vary with factors such as navigation sensor selection, aircraft system faults, external navigation aid failures and aircraft to navigation aid geometry, and because the RNP varies depending on the flight phase of the aircraft, the extendable bars extend and retract as the ANP and/or RNP vary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> As stated, the Required Navigation Performance (RNP) process is a probabilistic approach to evaluating an aircraft&apos;s deviation from its intended course. In this regard, a standard distribution curve <highlight><bold>281</bold></highlight> can be used to represent the relationship between the ANP and RNP, with the area underneath the curve proportional to the length of the extendable bars <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>, as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>C. Because RNP represents the minimum required navigation performance, it is desirous that the ANP remain as far under the RNP as possible, preferably approaching zero. In this regard, the extendable bars extend from the left and right end markers toward the reference point as the ANP approaches the RNP, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</cross-reference>. Similarly, the extendable bars retract toward the left and right end markers as the ANP approaches zero, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> with respect to the lateral flight path scale, the length of the extendable bars <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> are typically determined with respect to the allowable FTE, which can be calculated by evaluating the inverse probability at 95% for the RNP limit, and 99.999% for the integrity containment boundary. Whereas separate extendable bars could be displayed for the RNP limit and the integrity containment boundary, in a preferred embodiment the extendable bars take into account the more restrictive integrity containment boundary. Plotting the ratio ANP/RNP versus the allowable FTE/RNP for the RNP limit (line <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight>) and the integrity containment boundary (line <highlight><bold>284</bold></highlight>), the relative length of the confidence region can be seen, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. Whereas the length of the confidence region can be determined by directly evaluating the RNP limit and integrity containment boundary independently, in a preferred embodiment, the length of the confidence region can be approximated (line <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight>) according to the following equation: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, similar to the lateral extendable bars <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> of the lateral flight path scale, determining the length of the vertical extendable bars is typically determined relative to the vertical allowable FTE, which can be calculated by evaluating the inverse probability at 99.7% for the RNP limit. Unlike the lateral allowable FTE, the vertical allowable FTE typically does not contain an integrity containment boundary component. However, it should be understood that the vertical allowable FTE and, thus the vertical extendable bars, could include an integrity containment boundary component without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Plotting the ratio ANP/RNP versus the allowable FTE/RNP for the RNP limit, the length of the vertical confidence region can be seen, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. Whereas the length of the confidence region can be determined by directly evaluating the RNP limit directly, in a preferred embodiment, the length of the vertical confidence region can be approximated (line <highlight><bold>288</bold></highlight>) according to the following equation: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> With respect to the intersecting flight path pointers <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>274</bold></highlight>, reference is now made to FIGS. <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>D, which illustrates an aircraft flying toward a horizontal intersecting path and the corresponding horizontal flight path scale. Although the illustrations depict only a horizontal intersecting flight path and horizontal flight path scale, it should be under that the display could additionally or alternatively include a vertical flight path scale with a vertical intersecting flight path pointer as the aircraft flies toward a vertical intersecting flight path. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Often during flight, aircraft approach different flight paths, which can define different modes of flight. For example, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>A, an aircraft flying in autopilot mode can move toward an ILS flight path <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> as the aircraft advances toward a final approach to a runway <highlight><bold>292</bold></highlight>. As illustrated, the aircraft is flying an actual flight path along a predefined flight path <highlight><bold>294</bold></highlight> such that the deviation pointer <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> aligns with the reference point <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> of the horizontal flight path scale. As the aircraft flies toward the intersecting flight path <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight>, the aircraft proceeds from position B, through position C, to position D. When the horizontal position of the aircraft is within the RNP of the intersecting flight path, the display displays an intersecting flight path pointer <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight> on the flight path scale. When the aircraft is at position B, the intersecting flight path pointer is just within the left RNP end marker, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> As the aircraft approaches the intersecting flight path <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>, the intersecting flight path pointer <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight> moves along the flight path scale toward the reference point <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</cross-reference>. When the aircraft reaches the intersecting flight path, the intersecting flight path pointer approaches alignment with the reference point and, as illustrated, the deviation pointer <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</cross-reference>. Although not illustrated, if the aircraft were to bypass the intersecting flight path, the intersecting flight path pointer would bypass the reference point on the flight path scale and proceed toward the right end marker <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight>. At the point the aircraft intersects the intersecting flight path, the aircraft can alter it&apos;s flight path to thereby follow the intersecting flight path, such as by following an intersecting ILS flight path. At this point, the aircraft might typically change autopilot modes from LNAV and VNAV to LOC and G/S. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Reference is now made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, which is exemplary of a method of utilizing the present invention. According to the method, when the air crew desires to fly a desired flight plan utilizing LNAV and/ VNAV guidance, the air crew enters into the left and right CDU&apos;s <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> the lateral and/or vertical desired flight plan, which are then transferred to the FMC&apos;s <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, as described above. The primary FMC calculates the predefined flight path according to the desired flight plan and outputs navigation guidance signals for vertical navigation VNAV and/or lateral navigation LNAV, and transmits the LNAV and/or VNAV signals to the autopilot flight director system <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. (Block <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> To determine the deviation of the actual flight path of the aircraft with respect to the desired flight path, the actual flight path of the aircraft is continuously acquired, such as by the FMC&apos;s <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, using position sensor information, such as from a GPS (Global Positioning System), an IRS (Inertial Reference System) and a ground-based radio system. (Block <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>). From the actual flight path and the predefined flight path, the deviation of the aircraft from the predefined flight path can be continuously calculated, which is typically accomplished by the primary FMC and thereafter transmitted to the display processor <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. (Block <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>). Typically, the deviation is transmitted to the display processor as lateral and vertical errors in nautical miles lateral and in feet vertical, which the display processor continuously translates to position the deviation pointers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> After the deviation of the aircraft has been calculated, or as the deviation of the aircraft is being calculated, the RNP and ANP for the aircraft are continuously determined. The RNP for the current flight phase is determined, typically in the FMC&apos;s <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> by using an internal database of predetermined RNP values. (Block <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>). For example, an aircraft flying in an enroute flight phase might have a predetermined RNP value of 4.0, while an aircraft flying in the terminal area might have an RNP of 1.0 nm. Additionally, or alternatively, the RNP for the current flight phase can be manually inputted into the FMS-CDU <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The ANP is calculated, typically by the primary FMC, according to factors such as navigation aid performance characteristics and aircraft geometry, as such is known to those skilled in the art. (Block <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>). The FMC continuously determines the RNP and ANP based upon the current flight phase of the aircraft and the instantaneous navigation performance of the aircraft, and thereafter transmits the RNP and ANP values to the display processor <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> After the RNP and ANP are determined, typically after the display processor <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> receives the RNP and ANP values, the length of the extendable bars <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> are continuously calculated, such as by the display processor. While the length of the extendable bars can be calculated according to any of the methods described above, the length of the extendable bars are typically calculated relative to the allowable FTE according to the approximation method above for determining the length of the confidence region <highlight><bold>276</bold></highlight>. (Block <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In addition to determining the length of the extendable bars <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>, intersecting flight paths <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> that are within the RNP, such as runway approach paths, can be determined, such as by the display processor <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. In this regard, the display processor continuously receives information regarding intersecting flight paths within the RNP of the aircraft, such as from other aircraft guidance systems including the Instrument Landing System (ILS), the Microwave Landing System (MLS) and the Global Navigation Satellite System Landing System (GLS). (Block <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>). After receiving the information regarding intersecting flight paths, the display processor can translate the distance relative to the predefined flight path to determine the position of the intersecting flight path pointers <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>274</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Once the display processor <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> made all necessary calculations and determinations, the display processor displays the deviation pointers <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight>, extendable bars <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> and intersecting flight path pointers <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>274</bold></highlight> on the respective lateral and vertical flight path scales. (Block <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>). Whereas the flight path scales including the deviation pointers, extendable bars and intersecting flight path pointers can be displayed in any of a number of locations on the aircraft, in a preferred embodiment the flight path scales including the deviation pointers, extendable bars and intersecting flight path pointers are displayed on the primary flight displays <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> of the aircraft. (Block <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>). As the aircraft deviation, the ANP and/or RNP, or the distance of intersecting flight paths change, the FMC and display processor continuously operate to alter the display accordingly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> As the display processor <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> displays the deviation pointers and extendable bars, the pilot or other air crew member can view the deviation pointer <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> with respect to the extendable bars <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> to ensure that the ANP is within the RNP for the current flight phase. As illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>C, when the actual flight path <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> of the aircraft deviates from the predefined flight path <highlight><bold>276</bold></highlight>, the deviation pointer <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> accordingly deviates from the reference point <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> on the flight path scale of the display. If the ANP of the aircraft is within the RNP, the deviation pointer remains outside of the extendable bars, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</cross-reference>. (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, block <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>). As the ANP approaches the RNP, however, the extendable bars extend toward the reference point and, thus, the deviation pointer. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>C, when the deviation pointer reaches any point within the extendable bars, the aircraft no longer has an ANP below the RNP and, thus, the navigation of the aircraft is no longer operating within the required accuracy. If the deviation pointer remains within the extendable bars for more than a predefined period of time, the display can notify the pilot or air crew member of the inadequate ANP level. (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, block <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>). For example, if the ANP is below the RNP for more than ten seconds, the display can provide a notification by altering the color of the extendable bars, such as from white to yellow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> As long as the aircraft is flying according to LNAV and/or VNAV guidance, the deviation pointers <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight>, extendable bars <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> and intersecting flight path pointers <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>274</bold></highlight> will be continuously displayed. However, if the aircraft enters a different mode by flying according to a different guidance system, such as ILS after the aircraft intersects an ILS flight path, the display typically changes from the flight path scale displays to an ILS display. The ILS display, although not illustrated, would typically include a glideslope scale in place of the vertical flight path scale along the right side of the attitude director indicator <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Similarly, the ILS display would also typically include a localizer scale in place of the lateral flight path scale below the attitude director indicator shading. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> In various advantageous embodiments, portions of the system and method of the present invention include a computer program product. The computer program product for providing navigation performance based flight path deviation and/or intersecting flight path information includes a computer-readable storage medium, such as the non-volatile storage medium, and computer-readable program code portions, such as a series of computer instructions, embodied in the computer-readable storage medium. Typically, the computer program is stored and executed by a processing unit or a related memory device, such as logic module <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In this regard, FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are block diagram, flowchart and control flow illustrations of methods, systems and program products according to the invention. It will be understood that each block or step of the block diagram, flowchart and control flow illustrations, and combinations of blocks in the block diagram, flowchart and control flow illustrations, can be implemented by computer program instructions. These computer program instructions may be loaded onto a computer or other programmable apparatus to produce a machine, such that the instructions which execute on the computer or other programmable apparatus create means for implementing the functions specified in the block diagram, flowchart or control flow block(s) or step(s). These computer program instructions may also be stored in a computer-readable memory that can direct a computer or other programmable apparatus to function in a particular manner, such that the instructions stored in the computer-readable memory produce an article of manufacture including instruction means which implement the function specified in the block diagram, flowchart or control flow block(s) or step(s). The computer program instructions may also be loaded onto a computer or other programmable apparatus to cause a series of operational steps to be performed on the computer or other programmable apparatus to produce a computer implemented process such that the instructions which execute on the computer or other programmable apparatus provide steps for implementing the functions specified in the block diagram, flowchart or control flow block(s) or step(s). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, blocks or steps of the block diagram, flowchart or control flow illustrations support combinations of means for performing the specified functions, combinations of steps for performing the specified functions and program instruction means for performing the specified functions. It will also be understood that each block or step of the block diagram, flowchart or control flow illustrations, and combinations of blocks or steps in the block diagram, flowchart or control flow illustrations, can be implemented by special purpose hardware-based computer systems which perform the specified functions or steps, or combinations of special purpose hardware and computer instructions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The present invention therefore provides pilots and/or air crew members with a clear, concise display of the ANP as it relates to the RNP, intersecting flight paths and current actual flight path deviation from a predefined flight path., in contrast to ANP and RNP displayed on the FMS-CDU in text form along with a large amount of other text information. Therefore, the display of the present invention requires less time, adds less distraction and presents a more intuitive, precise depiction than conventional FMS-CDU displays of ANP and RNP information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Many modifications and other embodiments of the invention will come to mind to one skilled in the art to which this invention pertains having the benefit of the teachings presented in the foregoing descriptions and the associated drawings. Therefore, it is to be understood that the invention is not to be limited to the specific embodiments disclosed and that modifications and other embodiments are intended to be included within the scope of the appended claims.
