<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A disposable balloon catheter and corresponding catheter system are disclosed. In one embodiment, the catheter system comprises several components, such as: (a) an elongated catheter comprising a first outer diameter, a first proximal end and a first distal end; (b) an elongated balloon carrier having a second proximal end, a second distal end and a second outer diameter, the second proximal end of the carrier and the first distal end of the catheter being configured to permit the first distal end of the catheter to matingly engage the second proximal end of the carrier, the second outer diameter of the balloon carrier being similar to the first outer diameter of the catheter; and (c) a disposable balloon formed from an expandable and resilient biocompatible material, the balloon having a lumen disposed between a third proximal end and a third distal end thereof, the lumen having at least a third inside diameter. The second proximal end of the carrier and the first distal end of the catheter are preferably configured to permit the first distal end of the catheter to matingly engage the second proximal end of the carrier. In a preferred embodiment, the second outer diameter of the balloon carrier is similar to the first outer diameter of the catheter such that the second diameter of the carrier and the third diameter of the balloon permit the balloon first to be slideably mounted onto the balloon carrier and second to be slideably moved from the carrier onto the catheter when the second proximal end of the carrier is matingly or otherwise suitably engaged with the first distal end of the catheter. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention is generally directed to the field of medical catheter systems and balloons therefor. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Urethral pressure measurements have been used for more than 75 years to assess urethral closure function. Urethral pressure and urethral closure pressure are idealized concepts which aim to represent the ability of the urethra to prevent leakage. So long as the intraurethral pressure exceeds the proximal fluid pressure, urine cannot leak and therefore the subject should be continent. Measurement of urethral pressures requires the introduction of a catheter adapted to perform such measurements. A variety of different techniques are employed to make urethral pressure measurements. Moreover, in the field of urethral impedance planimetry, it is known to measure the elasticity or &ldquo;tonus&rdquo; of the urethra, the cross-sectional area of the urethra, bladder pressure, abdominal pressure and detrusor pressure. EMGs and imaging data may also be obtained when making such measurements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> One well known technique for assessing a patient&apos;s bladder function is PCA (or &ldquo;Pressure Cross-Sectional Area&rdquo;) catheter measurement as described, for example, in &ldquo;A System for Measurement of Micturition Urethral Cross-Sectional Areas and Pressures&rdquo; by Mortensen et al., Med. &amp; Biol. Eng. &amp; Comput., 1983, 21, 482-488; &ldquo;Simultaneous Recording of Pressure and Cross-Sectional Area in the Female Urethra: A Study of Urethral Closure Function in Healthy and Stress Incontinent Women&rdquo; by Lose in &ldquo;Neurology and Urodynamics,&rdquo; Volume 11, Number 2, 1992; and &ldquo;Urethral Pressure Measurement&mdash;Problems and Clinical Value&rdquo; by Lose, Scand. J. Urol. Nephrol. Suppl. 207. See also &ldquo;Urethral Impedance Planimetry&rdquo; presented by Lose et al. at the Medtronic Satellite Symposium, ICS, Tampere, Finland, 2001. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a prior art PCA catheter system <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> comprising catheter body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, expandable and resilient balloon <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> mounted near distal end <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the catheter, balloon channel <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> for introducing saline solution <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> inside and removing saline solution <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> from balloon <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, distal micro-pressure transducer <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> mounted near distal tip <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of catheter body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, proximal micro-pressure transducer <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> mounted beneath a portion of balloon <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and situated proximally from distal pressure transducer <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, and electrodes <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>C and <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>D mounted beneath balloon <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> on catheter body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Electrical connectors <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> at the proximal end of catheter system <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> permit electrical connections to be established between electrodes <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>A through <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>D, transducers <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, or temperature or other sensors, and external recording and/or analysis equipment (not shown in the Figures). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Cross-sectional area (or &ldquo;A&rdquo;) is determined by delivering high frequency alternating current between excitation electrodes <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>D and measuring the electrical conductivity of the saline solution inside balloon <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Balloon <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is then inflated and deflated incrementally with saline solution during rest and provocative maneuvers, and the drop in voltage between sensing electrodes <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>D is measured. Using the field gradient principles described by Harris et al. in &ldquo;Electrical Measurements of Urethral Flow&rdquo; in &ldquo;Urodynamics&rdquo;, New York, Academic Press, Chapter 34, page 465, cross-sectional area A may be determined. The pressure inside balloon <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be increased incrementally to induce dilation, and the resulting pressures may be recorded using the proximal and distal pressure transducers. The resulting pressure response curve is a stress relaxation curve, which may be analyzed to determine the elastic properties of the patient&apos;s urethra. Balloon <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is preferably fully distensible within the physiological range of the urethral cross-sectional area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It will now be seen that PCA catheter system <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> comprises several expensive components, most notably distal micro-pressure transducer <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, proximal micro-pressure transducer <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, and electrodes <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>C and <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>D. In addition, catheter system <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> requires the incorporation of balloon channel <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the inclusion and mounting of balloon <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Because the cost of a single PCA catheter system <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> may easily exceed several thousand dollars, it is preferable that at least portions of PCA catheter system <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> be reusable following sterilization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> To date, some PCA catheters have been re-used by mounting disposable balloons on catheter body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> using sutures or ties <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> that are secured around the proximal and distal ends <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> of balloon <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Mounting balloon <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> on catheter body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> using such manual attachment techniques is time consuming, tedious and does not produce reliable seals between proximal and distal ends <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> of balloon <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and the outside diameter of the catheter. What is needed is a PCA catheter system having a disposable balloon which may be readily and quickly mounted on or removed from a catheter body, and which also provides a competent non-leaking seal between the balloon and the catheter when the balloon is filled with saline solution. </paragraph>
