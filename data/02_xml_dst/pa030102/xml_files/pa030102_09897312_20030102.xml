<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to sliders for reclosable fasteners, and, more particularly, sliders that assist in opening and closing polymeric bags. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Polymeric bags are popular household items that are used in a variety of applications including storage of food. The addition of reclosable fasteners or zippers to these bags has further enhanced their utility and the addition of a slider has made the fasteners easier to open and close. The fasteners include complementary first and second profiles that engage each other to close the bag. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> One problem encountered in installing the slider to the fastener is distortion to the first and second profiles of the fastener. The profiles may be distorted when the slider is placed onto the fastener. More specifically, the profiles may be distorted from internal shoulders of the slider that partially form a cavity of the slider. To assist in preventing distortion to the profiles when inserting the slider onto the fastener, the slider may be constructed to have improved flexibility. These flexible sliders, however, do not generally have a desirable stiffness to remain on the fastener during normal use by a consumer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> To address this problem, some sliders have been developed to be assembled or closed around the first and second profiles of the fastener. These sliders are assembled over the profiles by the use of interlocking structures molded into various portions of the slider. It has also been suggested to incorporate additional part(s) to provide stiffness to the slider. Another solution that has been applied is to fold the slider over the fastener, such as in U.S. Pat. No. 5,067,208. Other solutions have been to cut the profile and insert the slider over a cut end, such as in U.S. Pat. No. 5,431,760. These solutions, however, include additional steps that result in a more complicated and typically lesser efficient manufacturing process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A need therefore exists for an improved slider that can be inserted over the profiles of the fastener with little or no distortion, while providing a desirable stiffness to remain on the fastener during normal use. </paragraph>
</section>

The slider is slidably mounted to the fastener and includes a top, a first side, a second side and a separation member on an underside of the top. The separation member is adapted to open and close the fastener. The first side has at least one slot for separating the first side into at least two sections. The second side has at least one slot for separating the second side into at least two sections. Each of the slots extends from respective ends of the first and second sides opposite the top and extends through the respective sides. The sides and top have respective inner and outer surfaces. At least a portion of the inner surfaces of the sides forms respective first and second shoulders. The inner surfaces of the first and the second sides and the top define a cavity. A supporting tooling member is placed into at least one slot such that the tooling member is supporting at least one of the first and second profiles. The slider is placed on the fastener by opening one or more of the sections of the slider such that the first and second sides are at a sufficient distance to allow the insertion of the slider onto the first and second profiles. The slider is positioned into the cavity such that the first and second profiles are located above the respective first and second shoulders.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> While the invention is susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, specific embodiments thereof have been shown by way of example in the drawings and will herein be described in detail. It should be understood, however, that it is not intended to limit the invention to the particular forms disclosed but, on the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. </paragraph>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Referring initially to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, there is illustrated a slider <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to one embodiment of the present invention. The slider <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is a unitary or integral structure and, thus, is a one-piece slider. The slider <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is an inverted generally U-shaped member. The sliders of the present invention may be combined with a fastener or zipper <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in forming a thermoplastic bag B (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The slider <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> comprises a top <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a pair of sides or side walls <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> depending downwardly from the top <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and a separation member or finger <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> located on an underside of the top <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The separation finger <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is positioned between the sides <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The bottom plan view of the slider <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> At the lower end of each side <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are inwardly extending shoulders <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>), respectively, which cooperate with the separation finger <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to assist in opening and closing the fastener <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The shoulders <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> also engage the fastener <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to inhibit or prevent the slider <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from being lifted off profile edges while the slider <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> straddles the fastener <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Specifically, the shoulders <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> engage with lower surfaces of the profiles to inhibit or prevent (a) the slider from being pulled off in a direction perpendicular to the sliding motion and (b) the slider from being removed from the force required to open the profiles. To generate an outward force moment from the downward insertion force to separate the sidewalls and permit a snap-on action, the shoulders <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are tapered upwardly towards a center-line of the slider. Tapered surfaces <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>assist in guiding the slider onto the fastener <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The tapered surfaces <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may also be referred to as &ldquo;leads-ins&rdquo;. The shoulders <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, however, may be formed without being tapered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The separation finger <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has a wide portion <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) and a narrow portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>). The separation finger <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with the wide and narrow portions <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> interact with first and second portions <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>) of the fastener <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to lock and unlock first and second profiles <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> on the fastener <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. This interaction opens and closes the fastener <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the manner described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,007,143 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> More specifically, the wide portion <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the separation finger <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in cooperation with the shoulders <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> spread the first and second portions <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The spread first and second portions <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> separate the first and second profiles <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> thereby opening the fastener <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) as the slider <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is moved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> To close the fastener <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the slider <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is moved in the reverse direction and the narrow portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the separation finger <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> cooperates with the shoulders <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the sides <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the slider <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to bring the first and second portions <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> together. The first and second portions <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> when brought together lock the first and second profiles <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>). To close the fastener <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> completely, at least the wide portion <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the separation finger <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is removed from between the first and second portions <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the fastener <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Referring back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the slider <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also includes an optional molded window <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> that is formed in the top <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to assist in forming the shoulders <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The optional molded window <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> also assists in holding and/or locating the slider <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for insertion onto the profiles of the fastener <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> According to one embodiment, the slider <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also includes a slot or opening <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> formed in the side <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) and a corresponding slot <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) formed in the side <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The corresponding slots <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> assist in (a) placing the slider onto the fastener and (b) optimizing the sections of the slider, including the utilization of the polymeric resins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The slot <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> extends from a bottom edge <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the side <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in a generally vertical direction toward the top <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The slot <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> as extending into and through the side <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. It is contemplated that the slot <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be formed in other shapes than that depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. If the slider is formed by injection molding, the slot <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is preferably at least slightly tapered so as to assist in releasing it from the injection mold. Slot <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is preferably formed in the same manner as described with respect to the slot <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> slider <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is shown that is identical to the slider <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, except that the slider <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> includes two slots that are formed in each side <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. Side <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of the slider <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> includes slots <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> formed therein, while the side <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> also has two slots <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) that correspond with respective slots <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. It is contemplated that additional slots may be formed in the slider <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The slots of the slider <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> have the same purpose as described above with respect to the slots <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of slider <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In addition, the slots of the slider <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> as will be discussed below may assist in easier insertion of the slider onto the profiles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The slider <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> may be divided into three main functionally independent sections <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. The main function of section <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is to assist in opening the fastener, while the main function of the section <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is to assist in closing the fastener. The main function of the section <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is to retain the slider <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> on the fastener after installation. The section <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of slider <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may have profiled outer surfaces to assist a consumer in grasping and moving the slider. For example, the section <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of sides <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> may have outer surfaces that generally correspond to a customer&apos;s fingers/thumbs (i.e., concave inwardly) for easier grasping and moving of the slider <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The sides <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> may have varying cross-sectional thicknesses in its respective sections so as to optimize the main function of each section. The sections <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> also may be profiled to optimally use a desired amount of polymeric resin so as to minimize material usage. For example, the thicknesses of the sides <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of section <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> may be optimized for flexibility so as to allow the sides <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> to bend outwardly when the slider <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is inserted onto the first and second profiles <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the fastener. (See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) The thicknesses of the sides <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of sections <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> are contemplated to be less flexible than section <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The locations of sections <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> may be configured differently than shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>.
