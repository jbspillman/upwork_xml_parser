<section>
<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to liquid crystal displays, and more particularly to polarizers for use with liquid crystal displays. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Liquid crystal displays are optical displays used in devices such as laptop computers, hand-held calculators and digital watches. A typical liquid crystal display includes a liquid crystal display cell and an electrode matrix disposed between a pair of absorbing polarizers. The liquid crystal display cell contains, e.g., twisted nematic or super twisted nematic molecules. In the liquid crystal display, the optical state of portions of the liquid crystal display cell is altered by the application of an electric field using the electrode matrix. This creates an optical contrast for light passing through the liquid crystal display cell that results in the appearance of pixels of polarized light on the liquid crystal display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A typical liquid crystal display includes a front polarizer and a rear polarizer. These polarizers may be plane polarizers that absorb light of one polarization orientation more strongly than they absorb light of the orthogonal polarization orientation. The transmission axis of the front polarizer is usually crossed with the transmission axis of the rear polarizer in a liquid crystal display. The angle by which these transmission axes are crossed can vary from zero degrees to ninety degrees. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In general, unpolarized ambient light waves vibrate in a large number of directions without having a single characterizing electromagnetic radiation vector. By contrast, plane polarized light consists of light waves having a direction of vibration along a single electromagnetic radiation vector. Also, circularly polarized light has a direction of vibration along an electromagnetic radiation vector that rotates as the light propagates through space. Polarized light has many applications in electro-optical devices, such as the use of plane and circular polarizing filters to reduce glare in displays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Further, much commercial attention has been directed to the development and improvement of flat panel displays, particularly thin, compact flat panel displays. A problem encountered in the construction of plastic flat panel displays is the development of &ldquo;black spots,&rdquo; which arise from the formation of bubbles in the liquid crystal material from gas that has permeated through the plastic display materials. Another problem associated with plastic flat panel displays is moisture contamination of the liquid crystal display cell. These problems are avoided in conventional liquid crystal displays by using low permeability glass substrates instead of plastic. With respect to plastic flat panel displays, these problems are addressed by adding additional gas and moisture barrier layers to the liquid crystal display structure and/or the plastic substrates. However, adding such gas and moisture barrier layers increases the thickness, weight and cost of the displays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Polarizers in the form of synthetic polarizing films exhibit comparative ease of manufacture and handling and comparative ease with which they may be incorporated into electro-optical devices such as flat panel displays. In general, plane polarizing films have the property of selectively passing radiation vibrating along a given electromagnetic radiation vector and absorbing electromagnetic radiation vibrating along a second electromagnetic radiation vector based on the anisotropic character of the transmitting film medium. Plane polarizing films include dichroic polarizers, which are absorbing plane polarizers utilizing the vectorial anisotropy of their absorption of incident light waves. The term &ldquo;dichroism&rdquo; refers to the property of differential absorption of the components of incident light, depending on the vibration directions of the component light waves. Light entering a dichroic plane polarizing film encounters two different absorption coefficients along transverse planes, one coefficient being high and the other coefficient being low. Light emerging from a dichroic film vibrates predominantly in the plane characterized by the low absorption coefficient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Dichroic plane polarizing films include H-type (iodine) polarizers and dyestuff polarizers. For example, an H-type polarizer is a synthetic dichroic sheet polarizer including a polyvinyl alcohol-iodine complex. Such a chemical complex is referred to as a chromophore. The base material of an H-type polarizer is a water-soluble high molecular weight substance, and the resulting film has relatively low moisture and heat resistance and tends to curl, peel or otherwise warp when exposed to ambient atmospheric conditions. Further, H-type polarizers are inherently unstable, and require protective cladding, e.g., layers of cellulose triacetate, on both sides of the polarizer to prevent degradation of the polarizer in a normal working environment such as in a liquid crystal display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In contrast to H-type polarizers and other similar synthetic dichroic plane polarizers are intrinsic polarizers and thinly cladded or encapsulated polarizers. Intrinsic polarizers polarize light due to the inherent chemical structure of the base material used to form the polarizer. Such intrinsic polarizers are also typically thin and durable. Examples of intrinsic polarizers are K-type polarizers. A thinly cladded or encapsulated polarizer may be, e.g., an iodine polarizer coated on both surface with polymer coatings each having a thickness of only about 5 microns, and is also thin and durable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A K-type polarizer is a synthetic dichroic plane polarizer based on molecularly oriented polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) sheets or films with a balanced concentration of light-absorbing chromophores. A K-type polarizer derives its dichroism from the light absorbing properties of its matrix, not from the light-absorbing properties of dye additives, stains, or suspended crystalline materials. Thus, a K-type polarizer may have both good polarizing efficiency and good heat and moisture resistance. A K-type polarizer may also be very neutral with respect to color. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> An improved K-type polarizer, referred to as a KE polarizer, is manufactured by 3M Company, Norwood, Mass. The KE polarizer has improved polarizer stability under severe environmental conditions, such as high temperatures and high humidity. In contrast to H-type polarizers, in which the light absorption properties are due to the formation of a chromophore between PVA and tri-iodide ion, KE polarizers are made by chemically reacting the PVA by an acid catalyzed, thermal dehydration reaction. The resulting chromophore, referred to as polyvinylene, and the resulting polymer may be referred to as a block copolymer of vinylalcohol and vinylene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> For H-type polarizers, stability is achieved by sandwiching the polarizer between two plastic substrates, such as two layers of cellulose triacetate, one on each side of the polarizer. However, even in these structures the application of heat, humidity and/or vacuum can adversely affect the properties of the polarizer. By contrast, K-type polarizers such as KE polarizers do not need to be sandwiched between sheets of cellulose triacetate. The polyvinylene chromophore of the KE polarizer is an extremely stable chemical entity, since the chromophore is intrinsic to the polymer molecule. This chromophore is thermally stable as well as resistant to attack from a wide range of solvents and chemicals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> A K-type polarizer such as a KE polarizer has several advantages over other types of polarizers, e.g., iodine and dyestuff polarizers. K-type polarizers have more durable chromophores, are thinner, and may be designed with variable transmission levels. Most notably, K-type polarizers such as KE polarizers may be used in applications that require high performance under severe environmental conditions, including high temperatures and high humidity, such as 85&deg; C. and 85% relative humidity, for extended periods of time. Under such extreme environmental conditions, the stability of iodine polarizers is greatly reduced, thus limiting their usefulness in applications such as flat panel displays. Due to the inherent chemical stability of K-type polarizers, a wide variety of adhesive formulations, including pressure sensitive adhesives, can be applied directly to K-type polarizers. Further, a single-sided plastic support is adequate to give physical support for K-type polarizers, and since this support can be located outside the optical path of the liquid crystal display module, it need not be optically isotropic and lower-cost substrates such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) are acceptable alternatives. Moreover, the ability to construct single-sided laminates allows the optical structures to be thinner, allowing for additional flexibility in the design and manufacture of flat panel display elements. These advantages of K-type polarizers may be used in a wide variety of optical applications, including flat panel displays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In contrast to a plane polarizer, a circular polarizer may be constructed of a plane polarizer and a quarter-wavelength retarder. A quarter-wavelength retarder shifts the phase of light waves propagating along one plane through the retarder by one-quarter wavelength, but does not shift the phase of light waves propagating through the retarder along a transverse plane. The result of combining light waves that are one-quarter wavelength out of phase and that vibrate along perpendicular planes is circularly polarized light, for which the electromagnetic radiation vector rotates as the combined light waves travel through space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Circularly polarized light may be described with respect to two distinct polarization states: left-handed (L) and right-handed (R) circularly polarized light. A circular polarizer absorbs light of one of these polarization states and transmits light of the other polarization state. The use of circular polarizers to reduce glare in displays is well known. In particular, light from an emissive display can be selectively transmitted through a circular polarizer, while background ambient light reflected in the display, which causes glare, may be reduced or eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> A conventional liquid crystal display stack <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. A liquid crystal display cell <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has two surfaces coated with layers <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of an adhesive, e.g., a pressure sensitive adhesive, to secure polarizer structures to both surfaces of the liquid crystal display cell. The polarizer structures each include plane polarizers <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, e.g., H-type polarizers, which have layers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of cellulose triacetate as a protective cladding coated or laminated on both surfaces thereof. Liquid crystal display stack <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also typically includes a transflector or reflector <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> attached to the back side of the display by an adhesive layer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, e.g., a pressure sensitive adhesive, the transflector or reflector functioning to enhance the brightness and contrast of the liquid crystal display. H-type polarizers <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> each typically have a thickness of approximately 20 microns, each of the layers of cellulose triacetate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is typically approximately 80 microns thick, and pressure sensitive adhesive layer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> typically has a thickness of approximately 25 microns. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to the use of intrinsic polarizers disposed adjacent to either the front surface or the rear surface, or both, of a liquid crystal display cell. Alternatively, thinly cladded or encased iodine polarizers may be disposed adjacent to either or both surfaces of a liquid crystal display cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a liquid crystal display stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> according to the present invention. A liquid crystal display cell <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is coated with layers <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of an adhesive, e.g., a pressure sensitive adhesive such as Polatechno AD-20, to secure polarizer structures to the liquid crystal display cell, similar to liquid crystal display stack <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. On the viewing side of liquid crystal display stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, an intrinsic polarizer <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, preferably a K-type or thin KE polarizer sheet, is attached to liquid crystal display cell <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> using adhesive layer <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. K-type polarizer <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> typically has a thickness of approximately 20 microns. Such a KE polarizer may be a sheet of the type manufactured by 3M Company, Norwood, Mass. K-type polarizer <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> may also include a supporting substrate in the form of a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) support layer <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> on its surface facing the viewing side of the liquid crystal display. PET support layer <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> typically has a thickness of approximately 25-180 microns. However, liquid crystal display stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> does not require a supporting substrate such as PET support layer <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>; for example, a KE polarizer sheet may itself be attached to a display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> On the back side of liquid crystal display stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, another intrinsic polarizer <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> such as a K-type or thin KE polarizer sheet is attached to liquid crystal display cell <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> using adhesive layer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. K-type polarizer <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> also typically has a thickness of approximately 20 microns. A transflector or reflector <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> may be disposed on the surface of K-type polarizer <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> facing the back side of the liquid crystal display to enhance the brightness and contrast of the liquid crystal display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Using intrinsic polarizers in the liquid crystal display stack eliminates the need for protective cladding of the polarizers. The cladding used for other types of polarizers, e.g., H-type polarizers, is generally a layer of cellulose triacetate disposed on both sides of the polarizer. Removing the cladding layers of cellulose triacetate results in a significant reduction in the thickness of the liquid crystal display stack. For example, liquid crystal display stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, including PET support layer <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and transflector or reflector <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, is approximately 300 microns thinner than the corresponding liquid crystal display stack <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Further, the K-type polarizers used in liquid crystal display stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> could provide an effective gas and moisture permeability barrier to the liquid crystal material in the liquid crystal display cell. Thus, no additional barrier layers or cladding may be needed in a liquid crystal display structure constructed with a K-type polarizer disposed on each side of the liquid crystal display cell to achieve desired permeability specifications. In particular, a standard for moisture vapor transmission rate (MVTR), ASTM F1249, is less than 20 gm/m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/day, and the oxygen transmission rate (O2GTR), ASTM D3985, is less than 1 ml/m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/day. Structures for liquid crystal displays formed using KE polarizers, including PET support structures, have been shown to have a MVTR of 4.6 or less gm/m2/day and an O2GTR of less than 0.005 ml/m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/day (tested at 20&deg; C. and 90% relative humidity). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Although the present description refers to intrinsic polarizers, thinly cladded or encased iodine polarizer may be substituted for either or both intrinsic polarizers. A thinly cladded polarizer includes an iodine polarizer sheet coated on both surfaces with polymer coatings each having a thickness of about 5 microns. A thinly cladded polarizer is thin and durable, similar to an intrinsic polarizer such as a K-type polarizer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows an alternative polarizer structure <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> that may be attached to the back side of a liquid crystal display device. An intrinsic polarizer <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> such as a K-type or thin KE polarizer sheet may have an adhesive layer <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, e.g., a pressure sensitive adhesive, on one of its surfaces, which adhesive layer is covered by a removable release liner <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> prior to attaching polarizer structure <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> to the liquid crystal display. For example, the typical thickness of KE polarizer <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is approximately 15-35 microns, the typical thickness of pressure sensitive adhesive coating <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is approximately 16-35 microns, and the typical thickness of release liner <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is approximately 25-50 microns. Further, KE polarizer <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> may be laminated onto release liner <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> having pressure sensitive adhesive coating <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> previously applied thereon. A PET support layer <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> having a transflective coating <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> may be attached to the other surface of intrinsic polarizer <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> by an adhesive layer <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. Since one surface of a KE polarizer sheet typically comprises a PET layer, an adhesive other than a pressure sensitive adhesive may be used, e.g., a coated adhesive that is thermally cured such as a copolyester adhesive that is crosslinked using multifunctional isocyanates. Transflective coating <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> functions to enhance the brightness and contrast of the liquid crystal display. Transflective coating <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, which typically has a thickness of approximately 8-20 microns, may be coated on or laminated onto PET support layer <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. The transflective coating may be, e.g., a nacreous pigment coated onto PET such as commercially available STR400 from Nippon Paper or a transflector available from Teijin. The typical thickness of adhesive layer <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is approximately 4-20 microns, and the typical thickness of PET support layer <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is approximately 12-100 microns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows an alternative polarizer structure <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> to that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Polarizer structure <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> includes no PET support layer. Instead, transflective coating <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> may be contained on or laminated onto intrinsic polarizer <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, which may have an adhesive layer <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>, e.g., having a thickness up to approximately 20 microns, or no adhesive layer at all. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows another alternative polarizer structure <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> to that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Polarizer structure <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> has a PET support layer <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> attached to intrinsic polarizer <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> by a diffuse adhesive layer <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>. Diffuse adhesive <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, which typically has a thickness of approximately 12-40 microns, functions similarly to the combination of an adhesive layer and a transflective coating to enhance the brightness of the liquid crystal display and to attach PET support layer <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> to intrinsic polarizer <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. For example, diffuse adhesive <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> may be a pressure sensitive adhesive to which glass beads have been added to scatter light passing through the adhesive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows an alternative polarizer structure <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> that may be attached to the front surface of a liquid crystal device. A retarder <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> such as a quarter-wavelength retarder has an adhesive layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, e.g., a pressure sensitive adhesive, on one of its surfaces, which adhesive layer is covered by a removable release liner <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> prior to attaching polarizer structure <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to the liquid crystal display. Retarder <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is preferably a thin film, broadband quarter-wavelength retarder effective over all or a substantial portion of the visible electromagnetic spectrum, such as the broadband quarter-wavelength retarders manufactured by Teijin. For example, the typical thickness of quarter-wavelength retarder <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is approximately 30-60 microns, the typical thickness of pressure sensitive layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is approximately 16-35 microns, and the typical thickness of release liner <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is approximately 25-50 microns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> An intrinsic polarizer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> such as a K-type or thin KE polarizer sheet has an adhesive layer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, on one of its surfaces, which adhesive layer is attached to the other surface of retarder <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The typical thickness of KE polarizer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is approximately 15-35 microns, and the typical thickness of adhesive layer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is approximately 5-30 microns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> A PET support layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> having an antireflective coating <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> may be attached to the other surface of intrinsic polarizer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> by an adhesive layer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. Antireflective coating <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, which typically has a thickness of less than 1 micron, may be made from a low index of refraction thermopolymer such as Kynar 1702 and may be coated on one surface of PET support layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The typical thickness of adhesive layer <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> on the other surface of PET support layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is approximately 5-30 microns, and the typical thickness of PET support layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> itself is approximately 12-100 microns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The combination of intrinsic polarizer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> with retarder <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> acts as a circular polarizer, which significantly reduces the intensity of undesirable reflected ambient light, thereby increasing the contrast of the image formed by the emitted signal from the display. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, unpolarized ambient light <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> may be represented as a combination of left-handed (L) <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and right-handed (R) <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> circularly polarized light components. When unpolarized ambient light <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> enters liquid crystal display <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, one circularly polarized component of the ambient light, e.g., left-handed circular polarized light <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, is absorbed by the combination of polarizer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> with retarder <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, while the other component, the right-handed circularly polarized light <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, is transmitted through the liquid crystal display. The transmitted right-handed circularly polarized light <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is specularly reflected in the liquid crystal display. However, the handedness of circularly polarized light is reversed upon specular reflection, and the transmitted right-handed circularly polarized light <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> becomes left-handed circularly polarized light. The reflected left-handed circularly polarized light is reflected toward the combination of polarizer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> with retarder <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, where it is absorbed in the same manner as the left-handed circularly polarized component <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> of ambient light <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. Thus, both the left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized components of the ambient light are absorbed by the combination of polarizer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and retarder <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, which acts as a circular polarizer, during transmission through and reflection in liquid crystal display <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> so that they do not interfere with an emitted light signal <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows an alternative polarizer structure <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. Polarizer structure <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> includes no PET support layer. Instead, antireflective coating <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> or alternatively a hard coat <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> may be coated on or laminated onto intrinsic polarizer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Hard coat <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, which typically has a thickness of 1-6 microns, may be made, e.g., from an acrylate such as poly methyl methacrylate. Hard coat <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> may be either matte or clear. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows another alternative polarizer structure <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> to that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. In polarizer structure <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, retarder <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and adhesive layer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> are replaced by a liquid crystal polymer coating <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> disposed on intrinsic polarizer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Liquid crystal polymer coating <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, which typically has a thickness of up to approximately 100 microns, performs the function of enhancing the thickness of the liquid crystal display similar to retarder <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> shows an alternative polarizer structure <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> with enhanced brightness that may be attached to the back side of a liquid crystal device. In polarizer structure <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, a holographic element transflector known as Light Intensifying Film Technology (LIFT) <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> is laminated to an intrinsic polarizer <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> such as a K-type or thin KE polarizer sheet. As set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 5,886,799, LIFT includes a micro replicated structure <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> metalized with a layer of aluminum <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> that is formed on a PET support layer <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. The microreplicated surface of LIFT layer <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> may be attached to one surface of intrinsic polarizer <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> with an adhesive layer <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, e.g., a pressure sensitive adhesive. A release liner <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> may be attached to the other surface of intrinsic polarizer <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> by another adhesive layer <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>, e.g., a pressure sensitive adhesive. LIFT layer <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> enhances the brightness of the liquid crystal display by directing light transmitted through the liquid crystal display toward a region normal to the display&apos;s surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows another alternative polarizer structure <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> with enhanced brightness that may be attached to the back side of a liquid crystal device. In polarizer structure <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, a transflector known as Tilted Mirror Film (TMF) <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> is laminated to an intrinsic polarizer <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> such as a K-type or thin KE polarizer sheet. TMF <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> includes a microreplicated structure <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> metalized with a layer of silver <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> that is formed on a PET support layer <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. The microreplicated surface of TMF layer <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> may be attached to one surface of K-type polarizer <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> with an adhesive layer <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>, e.g., an optically clear pressure sensitive adhesive. A release liner <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> may be attached to the other surface of K-type polarizer <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> by another adhesive layer <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight>, e.g., an optically clear pressure sensitive adhesive. Alternatively, either adhesive layer <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> or adhesive layer <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> may be a diffuse pressure sensitive adhesive that diffusely scatters light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> shows a polarizer structure <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> with enhanced brightness that can be attached to the back side of a liquid crystal device that is an alternative to the polarizer structures of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference>. In particular, a simple transflector <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> in the form of a layer of metal such as silver or aluminum applied directly to one surface of an intrinsic polarizer <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> acts as a polarized mirror to reflect polarized light and enhance the brightness of the liquid crystal display. Transflector <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> may be formed by sputtering, vacuum depositing, or otherwise coating a layer of silver or aluminum to K-type polarizer <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight>. Another example of a transflector is a coating of mica on a polymer or adhesive matrix. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The use of a non-depolarizing, diffuse pressure sensitive adhesive layer <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> to attach a release liner <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> to intrinsic polarizer <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> further diffuses polarized light to enhance the brightness of the liquid crystal display. Alternatively, for a silver transflector <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>, a PET support layer <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> may be attached to the transflector by an adhesive layer <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight>, e.g., a pressure sensitive adhesive. As an additional alternative, silver transflector <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> may be disposed on a non-birefringent carrier (not shown) attached to K-type polarizer <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight>. Such a non-birefringent carrier may be, e.g., cellulose triacetate, a diacetate, or Transphan. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> shows a polarizer structure <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> using an intrinsic polarizer as a substrate for a conductor in a liquid crystal display without requiring any adhesive. In polarizer structure <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, a conductor <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> in the form of a metal layer <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, e.g., aluminum, disposed between layers of indium tin oxide (ITO) <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> is attached to a hard coat <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> deposited or coated directly onto K-type polarizer <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. A conductor pattern may then be etched into layers <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> of conductor <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>C show how a polarizer structure <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> may be formed using an intrinsic polarizer as a substrate for a microreplicated structure. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</cross-reference> shows an intrinsic polarizer <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>, e.g., a K-type or thin KE polarizer sheet, having a carrier or support layer <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> attached by an adhesive (not shown). Carrier layer <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> is not required to use intrinsic polarizer <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> as a substrate for a microreplicated structure. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B, a</cross-reference> layer of an ultraviolet-curable resin <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> is disposed on the surface of intrinsic polarizer <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> opposite to the surface attached to carrier layer <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>. Prior to curing resin <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight>, a microreplicating tool <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> is applied to resin <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> to form a microreplicated structure <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14C</cross-reference>). With tool <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> applied to the resin, resin <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> is then cured to set the microreplicated structure, and then tool <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> is removed. Microreplicated structure <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> enhances the brightness of the liquid crystal display by directing light transmitted through the liquid crystal display toward a region normal to the display&apos;s surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> shows an alternative polarizer structure <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> that may be attached to the rear surface of a liquid crystal display device. A reflective diffuse polarizer film <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is a multilayer polymer film that functions as a reflective polarizer, i.e., as a white, non-inverting filter than enhances the appearance of the liquid crystal display. Reflective diffuse polarizer film <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> may be attached to intrinsic polarizer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> with an adhesive layer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. Reflective diffuse polarizer film <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> may also be a specular reflective polarizer with a diffuse adhesive or a diffuse reflective polarizer with a clear adhesive. </paragraph>
