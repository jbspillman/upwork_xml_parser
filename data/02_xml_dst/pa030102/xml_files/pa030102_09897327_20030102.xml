<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates generally to towable devices for travel in a body of water and, more particularly, the invention relates to a human controlled towable device that may be maneuvered on and below the water surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Technology </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A variety of well known human controlled towable water sport devices such as water skis, knee boards, inflatable rafts, inner tubes, etc. are commonly used by water sports enthusiasts to travel at a relatively high speed on the surface of a body of water such as a river, a lake, an ocean, etc. Some of these water sport devices, such as inflatable rafts and inner tubes, are pulled over the water surface by a power boat using a towline such as a rope, cable, etc. that is connected between the water sport device and the power boat, while other water sport devices, such as water skis and knee boards, require the operator (i.e., the person using the water sport device) to fasten themselves to the water sport device via a boot, strap, etc. and to grasp a handle attached to one end of a towline that is pulled by a power boat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The operator of the above-noted commonly available water sport devices may influence or control the lateral movement of some types of water sport devices on the water surface by adjusting the attitude of their body with respect to the orientation of the water sport device, the towline, etc. and/or by changing the heading of the water sport device relative to the heading of the power boat that is pulling the water sport device. For example, by leaning to one side of the water sport device being towed and/or by forcing the heading of the water sport device to rotate toward that same side, the operator may cause the water sport device to move laterally toward that side. Of course, such operator controlled lateral motion of the water sport device works well with water sport devices such as skis and knee boards that have an oblong footprint and relatively flat or thin profiles. On the other hand, the lateral motion of a water sport device such as, for example, an inner tube, may be very difficult, if not impossible, for the operator to control via body orientation and/or orientation of the water sport device with respect to the power boat, the surface of the water, etc. While many of the above-noted towable water sport devices may enable an operator to exert limited control over the manner in which the water sport device travels on the water surface, none of these commonly available water sport devices enables an operator to travel and maneuver below the surface of the water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A number of technologies are currently available that enable human subsurface travel through a body of water (i.e., underwater travel). For example, snorkeling equipment enables underwater travel for short periods of time and self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA), bathyspheres, bathyscaphs, etc. enable humans to travel underwater for extended periods of time. In the case of SCUBA and snorkeling equipment, an operator may also choose to use an aquascooter, which is a self-contained propulsion unit, to increase the speed of their underwater travel. However, none of the above-mentioned currently available subsurface or underwater travel devices are designed to be towed by a vehicle or water craft such as a power boat, sail boat, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> One known towable board for underwater swimming and riding on the surface of a body of water is disclosed by U.S. Pat. No. 5,655,939 to Salvadores. The towable board disclosed by Salvadores has a substantially unitary and planar body that includes a pair of wing-shaped lobes, which are symmetrically disposed on opposing sides of a central axis of the towable board. The towable board further includes a pair of fins, each of which extends perpendicularly from a bottom surface of a respective one of the wing-shaped lobes. In operation, the towable board disclosed by Salvadores is pulled by a power boat via a towline while an operator grips the towable board using a pair of slot-shaped openings that extend through the towable board adjacent to the leading edge of each of the wing-shaped lobes. The operator may maneuver the towable board by rotating the board about an axis perpendicular to the water surface, thereby causing the fins to travel through the water at an angle with respect to the heading of the towline, which results in a lateral motion of the towable board in the direction of the rotation. To submerse the towable board or to change the depth at which the towable board is moving, the operator may push downward on the leading edges of the wing-shaped lobes using the slot-shaped openings in the towable board. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In accordance with one aspect of the invention, a device for use in water surface and subsurface travel may include a towbar having first and second end portions and a first control member rotatably coupled to the towbar adjacent to the first end portion. The first control member may have a first control surface and a second control surface opposite the first control surface. The device may further include a second control member rotatably coupled to the towbar adjacent to the second end portion and spaced from the first control member. The second control member may have a third control surface and a fourth control surface opposite the third control surface. The device may further include first and second grips spaced apart and fixed to the towbar between the first and second control members so that rotation of the first and second grips about a longitudinal axis of the towbar causes the first and second control members to rotate about the longitudinal axis of the towbar. Additionally, a towline connector may be fixed to the towbar between the first and second grips. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another aspect of the invention, a device for use in water surface and subsurface travel may include a towbar having a longitudinal axis and a first control member rotatably coupled to the towbar. The first control member may be rotatable about the longitudinal axis of the towbar and the device may include a second control member that is rotatably coupled to the towbar. The second control member may be rotatable about the longitudinal axis of the towbar independently from the first control member. Additionally, the device may include a connector fixed to the towbar for connecting the towbar to a towline.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is an exemplary isometric view of a human controlled towable device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> that enables a human operator to maneuver on and below the surface of a body of water such as, for example, a river, a lake, an ocean, etc. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the towable device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a towbar assembly <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having a longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a first end portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and a second end portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The towbar assembly <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may also include a first control member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a second control member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, handgrips <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and a towline connector <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The towbar assembly <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may include a rigid frame member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> made of steel, plastic, aluminum or any other suitable material that preferably, but not necessarily, provides a lightweight, corrosion-resistant characteristic. By way of example only, the rigid frame member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be made from aluminum or steel bar stock, thick-walled or thin-walled tubing, etc. to provide sufficient strength and durability for the towable device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in a marine or in any other water environment. Additionally, while the towbar assembly <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> as having a single rigid frame member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, a more complex frame having a plurality of interconnected frame members may be used instead to provide a rigid structure to which the control members <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the handgrips <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the towline connector <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> may be fixed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The towbar assembly <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may further include shafts or sleeves <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, which are best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, that are rotatably coupled to the rigid frame member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> using any suitable bearing and retention mechanisms. By way of example only, the sleeves <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may be designed as bushings that are rotatably engaged with protrusions or axles (not shown) that are integral with or attached to the rigid frame member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The ends of the protrusions or axles may be threaded to accept lock nuts, such as locknut <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, so that the control members <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the sleeves <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the handgrips <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may be fastened to the towbar assembly <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Alternatively or additionally, the control members <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the handgrips <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the sleeves <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may be assembled to the rigid frame member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> using push nuts, circlips, cotter pins, etc. or any combination thereof. Still further, in the case where the sleeves <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> form bushings that rotate about respective protrusions from the rigid frame member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the sleeves <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may be made completely or partially of a self-lubricating material such as, for example, Teflon. In any event, as can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> in conjunction with the above discussion, the handgrips <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may be manipulated to cause the control members <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to independently rotate about the longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the towbar assembly <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the control members <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> have respective upper control surfaces <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, lower control surfaces <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, leading edges <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and trailing edges <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. While the control members <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are depicted as having an airfoil type profile similar to that of a plane wing, other profiles may be used instead without departing from the scope and the spirit of the invention. The control members <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may each include a plurality of respective bores or mounting holes <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> that pass through the control members <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and that have axes which are substantially parallel to the leading edges <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the control members <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and to the longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the towbar assembly <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the mounting hole pairs <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> may be at different distances from the leading edges <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. In this manner, the distance between the leading edges <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the control members <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be varied or adjusted in a discrete or stepwise manner to achieve a desirable operational characteristic. For example, increasing the distance between the leading edges <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the towbar assembly <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may decrease the effort required to rotate the control members <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> about the longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> but may also decrease stability of the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> while it is being pulled through water. On the other hand, decreasing the distance between the leading edges <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the towbar assembly <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may increase stability of the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> while it is being pulled through water but may also increase the amount of effort or force required to rotate the control members <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> about the longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> It should be recognized that while three mounting holes are shown in each of the control members <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, more or fewer mounting holes may be used if desired. Additionally, while the mounting holes <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> are shown by way of example to have substantially circular outer perimeters, any other perimeter or cross-sectional geometry may be used instead. For example, the mounting holes <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> may have generally polygonal or any other non-circular outer perimeter geometry that mates with a similar or identical perimeter geometry of the outer surfaces of the shafts or sleeves <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to thereby key or lock the control members <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to the sleeves <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Of course, in the illustrated embodiments, the inner perimeters of the sleeves <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are substantially circular to enable the sleeves <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to freely rotate over the bearing surfaces of the protrusions or axles that extend from the rigid frame member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Still further, the control members <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be rotatably fixed with respect to the respective sleeves <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> using any other desired mechanism such as a channel and key arrangement, welding, gluing, a press fit, etc. However, in some cases it may be desirable to use fastening and/or keying mechanisms that enable easy removal and replacement of the control members <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. For example, a variety of control member designs having different control surface contours, sizes, etc. may be provided so that an operator can selectively attach a particular one of the control member designs to achieve a desired operational characteristic. In general, an operator&apos;s height, weight, strength, as well as an operator&apos;s desired stability, speed, maneuverability, etc. characteristics may affect the optimal control member selection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The control members <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be made of any suitable material such as, for example, lightweight plastics and/or metals that are sufficiently strong and durable in a marine or water environment. For example, the control members may be injection molded from a thermoplastic or an elastomeric material, machined from a plastic or a metal material and/or may be fabricated via welding, gluing, using fasteners, etc. using multiple component parts. To minimize weight and cost, the control members <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be partially or completely hollow or may have relieved areas (e.g., pockets, cavities, depressions, etc.) distributed over the control surfaces <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The handgrips <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are fixed to the outer surfaces of the respective sleeves <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> so that rotation of the handgrips <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> about the longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> causes the sleeves <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the control members <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to rotate about the longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Of course, because the control members <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are independently rotatable, one of the handgrips <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may be rotated in one direction about the longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> while the other one of the handgrips <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may be rotated in another direction about the longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The handgrips <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may be made of any suitable material such as, for example, a metal, which may include knurled potions that facilitate griping by an operator, a foam or other spongy material that can be easily gripped by an operator, a plastic material, etc. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the handgrips <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may be press fit, glued, or fixed in any other desired manner to the sleeves <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Still further, while the handgrips <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are depicted as being separate components that are fixed to the sleeves <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, the handgrips <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may instead be integrally formed with the sleeves <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. For example, the sleeves <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may be provided with larger diameter portions, knurled portions, or any other dimensions or features that facilitate an operator&apos;s rotating of the control members <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The towline connector <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> may be a U-shaped or a V-shaped component that is fixed to the rigid frame member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> via bolts, screws and/or welds and is preferably, but not necessarily, disposed substantially centrally between the control members <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the handgrips <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In operation, the towable device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be used in a body of water such as a river, a lake, an ocean, etc. and may be connected to a tow vehicle such as, for example, a power boat, a sail boat, a row boat, etc. via a towline. An operator may enter the body of water and grasp the handgrips <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> while lying in a prone or face-down position in the water. As the towable device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and its operator are pulled by the tow vehicle through the water, the operator may maneuver through the water by rotating the control members <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> via the handgrips <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and/or by manipulating their body orientation in the water and with respect to the towable device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. For example, rotating the trailing edges <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of both control members <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> upward and toward the towline connector <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> (and the towline) causes the towable device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to submerge or to dive in the water. On the other hand, rotating the control members <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> so that the trailing edges <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> rotate downward causing the towable device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and its operator to climb toward the water surface. Still further, rotating the control members <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in opposing directions causes the towable device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and its operator to travel in a spiraling manner through the water. Still further, by changing the rotations of the control members <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> so that both of the trailing edges <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are alternately rotated upward and downward at the same time, an operator may cause the towable device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to porpoise (i.e., to alternately jump out of and dive into the water). Of course, an operator may alternatively or additionally manipulate their body by, for example, leaning to one side or the other, changing the orientation of their legs or arms, etc. to maneuver through the water. Additionally, mechanical stops may be provided within the towable device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to limit the angle through which the control members <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be rotated. In this manner, stalling, dangerous maneuvers, etc. may be minimized or prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Preferably, but not necessarily, the towable device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is made of one or more materials and is configured so that the towable device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> floats in water when in a static or rest condition, thereby simplifying an operator&apos;s effort to mount or grab the towable device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and/or simplifying recovery of the towable device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the event that an operator loses their grip during use and becomes separated from the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is an exemplary plan view of an alternative control member design that may be used with the towable device described herein to enable a continuous adjustment of the distance between the leading edge of the control member and the rotational axis of the control member. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> control member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> having a leading edge <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and a trailing edge <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> includes a passage <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> therethrough that is substantially parallel to the leading edge <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and to the trailing edge <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. The passage <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> may have an oblong cross section such as, for example, an oval-shaped or rectangular cross section. However, any other cross section may be used instead. A rotatable shaft or sleeve <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, which may be similar or identical to the shafts or sleeves <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, traverses the passage <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. Threaded adjusting screws <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> pass through respective openings <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> in the control member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> through threaded bores <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> in the sleeve <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and into blind holes <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. Thus, by rotating the screws <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> either clockwise or counterclockwise, the sleeve <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> may be moved toward or away from the leading edge <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the control member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is an exemplary plan view of an adjustable towline connector <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> that may be used with the towable device described herein. The towline connector <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> includes an eye bolt <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> having a towing eye <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, a threaded portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and a pair of locknuts <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. The threaded portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of the eye bolt <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> passes through a rigid frame member <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, which may be similar or identical to the rigid frame member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, via a bore <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. As can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the distance between the towing eye <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and the rigid frame member <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be set to any desired distance that permits the locknuts <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> to be tightened to lock or fix the position of the towing eye <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is an exemplary sectional view of another adjustable towline connector <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> that may be used with the towable device described herein. The towline connector <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> includes an eye bolt <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> having a towing eye portion <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and a shaft portion <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> which has a plurality of bores or holes <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> therethrough. The shaft portion <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> of the connector <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> passes through a bore <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> in a rigid frame member <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, which may be similar or identical to the frame member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, and a pin <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> passes through the frame member <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> and one of the plurality of holes <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> to fix the connector <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to the frame member <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the distance between the towing eye <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and the frame member <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> may be varied in discrete amounts by fixing the eye bolt <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> to the frame member <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> using different ones of the holes <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. For example, when the hole <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> is used, the towing eye <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is nearer to the frame member <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> than when the hole <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is used. </paragraph>

A rotatable shaft or sleeve <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> may include a toothed portion <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> that drives a chain or toothed belt <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> that, in turn, may be used to rotate a pulley or gear <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> to cause the trailing edge <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> to rotate or pivot about an axis <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, which may be substantially parallel to a longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> of the shaft or sleeve <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. Although <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</cross-reference> illustrates the movement of the trailing edge <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> as being carried out using a belt or a chain, any other suitable drive mechanism may be used instead, such as, for example, direct drive gearing (i.e., a transmission), push rods and lever arms, fluid or hydraulic coupling, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</cross-reference> is an exemplary front view of a control member <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> having a variable control surface area that may be used with the towable device described herein. The control member <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> includes an outer portion or panel <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> and an inner portion or panel <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight> that is slidingly engaged with the outer panel <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>. Thus, the inner panel <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight> may be telescopically extended to increase the exposed surface area of the control member <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> or, alternatively, the inner panel <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight> may be telescopically compressed with respect to the outer panel <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> to decrease the exposed surface area of the control member <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>. The control member may further include a pin <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> for locking the relative positions of the inner and outer panels <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight>. The inner panel <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight> may be shaped so that variation of the position of the inner panel <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight> with respect to the outer panel <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> results in a continuous or, alternatively, a stepped, variation of the exposed surface area of the control member <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

The control member <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> includes a primary portion or panel <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> and an extension portion or panel <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> that is coupled to the primary panel <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> via a hinge <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight>. The extension panel <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> may be folded against the primary panel <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> as indicated by the dashed lines <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> to reduce the effective surface area of the control member <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. The control member <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> may further include a locking mechanism <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> that locks the extension panel <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> in an extended or unfolded position as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12C</cross-reference>. The locking mechanism <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> may be implemented using a U-shaped pin that may be pressed into bores that extend partially or completely through adjacent portions of the primary and extension panels <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In operation, a control member having a variable control surface area, such as those exemplary control members shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12B and 12C</cross-reference>, provides several advantages. For example, the control surface area may be increased during relatively low speed operation to increase or improve maneuverability. Conversely, the control surface area may be decreased during relatively high speed operation to reduce drag and stress on the control member. Additionally, the retracted, folded or minimal area condition for the control members may be used to reduce the overall footprint of the towable device to thereby facilitate storage of the device within a relatively small area or volume. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is an exemplary plan view, partially in section, of a dual ratio (i.e., two speed) transmission or gear set <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> that may be interposed between the handgrips and the control members of the towable device described herein. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13, a</cross-reference> rotatable shaft or sleeve <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight>, which may be rotated by the operator via a handgrip such as those described herein, or in any other manner, may be rotated to cause a control member <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight> to rotate. By way of example only, the gear set <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> may include input gears <highlight><bold>346</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>348</bold></highlight> that may be positioned to drive respective output gears <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight>. The shaft <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> may include detent grooves <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight> for receiving locking ball <highlight><bold>358</bold></highlight>, which may be biased by a spring <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> against the shaft or sleeve <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight>. Thus, as can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, when the shaft or sleeve <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> is positioned so that the locking ball <highlight><bold>358</bold></highlight> lies within the groove <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight>, input gear <highlight><bold>348</bold></highlight> drives output gear <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight>, resulting in a first drive ratio. On the other hand, when the shaft <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> is positioned so that the locking ball <highlight><bold>358</bold></highlight> lies within the groove <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight>, the input gear <highlight><bold>346</bold></highlight> drives the output gear <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>, resulting a second drive ratio. It should be recognized that a gear set or transmission such as the gear set <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> may be interposed between each handgrip or rotatable shaft or sleeve and the control members of the towable device described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> is an exemplary side view of a chassis <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> that may be used with the towable device described herein. For purposes of clarity of description (i.e., to show the relationships between the various components of the towable device described herein and the operator), the chassis <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is depicted as being made of a translucent or opaque material. However, any suitable plastic, elastomeric material, metal, etc. may be used to fabricate the chassis <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, the chassis <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> may include a fairing portion <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> that deflects water away from an operator <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> who is lying in a prone position while grasping the handgrips, such as the handgrips <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, of the towable device described herein. The chassis <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is disposed between the control members of the towable device, (one of the control members is shown at reference numeral <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>) and may have any suitable shape such as, for example a wedge, a partial ellipsoid, etc. A towline <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> extends through a front portion <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> of the chassis <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. As is also shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, the operator <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> may wear a helmet or any other protective headgear <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> and may wear a face mask or goggles <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> to provide further protection and/or to improve visibility while being pulled through the water. In the case where the chassis <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is made from a material that provides only limited or no visibility (i.e., a material that does not allow light to pass through it) a viewing window <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> may be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> is an exemplary side view of another chassis <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> that may be used with the towable device described herein. The chassis <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> is similar to the chassis <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> except that the chassis <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> includes an elongated lower portion <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> and a rudder <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> that pivots about a transverse axis of the chassis <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight>. An exemplary plan view of the rudder <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. In operation, the elevation of the rudder <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> may be manipulated by the operator&apos;s feet or legs to facilitate more dramatic vertical maneuvers such as, for example, porpoising and the like. Additionally, mechanical stops (not shown) may be provided as an integral feature of the rudder <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> or as a separate feature or structure of the towable device that protect an operator&apos;s knees from hyperextension. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> is an exemplary side view of yet another chassis <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> that may be used with the towable device described herein. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, the chassis <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> has an elongated upper portion <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight> and an elongated lower portion <highlight><bold>434</bold></highlight> so that an operator may be substantially encapsulated by the chassis <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>. The chassis <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> provides increased isolation of the operator from dynamic water pressures, thereby enabling the operator to perform maneuvers (e.g., porpoising) at greater speeds and/or in greater comfort. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> is an exemplary front view, partially in section, of another rudder <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> that may be used with the towable device described herein to facilitate lateral movements of the towable device.

A chassis <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> associated with the towable device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> may also include slots or openings <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight> that facilitate rotation of the towbar assembly <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> about the longitudinal axis of the shaft <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> to enable movement of the rudder <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. The relationship between the slots or openings <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight> and the towbar assembly <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> is an exemplary front sectional view illustrating one manner in which air storage tanks <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> and a flotation pad <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> may be fixed to a chassis <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> of the towable device described herein. The air storage tanks <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> may be conventional SCUBA tanks or any other air storage tanks that are capable of storing air for use by an operator. While two air storage tanks are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>, more or fewer tanks may used as needed. The floatation pad <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> is preferably fixed to a lower portion <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> of the chassis <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> so that the pad <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> lies between an operator and the lower portion <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> of the chassis <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight>, thereby providing improved comfort for the operator. The flotation pad <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> may be configured so that the towable device described herein remains buoyant when occupied by a typical human operator. In other words, the pad <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> provides sufficient buoyant force to keep the occupied towable device afloat, at least when the towable device is not being pulled through the water. By way of example, the pad <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> may be made of styrofoam or any other foam that provides buoyancy. Alternatively or additionally, buoyant force may be provided using one or more substantially hollow gas-filled structures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> is an exemplary diagrammatic view illustrating one manner in which air may be provided to an operator of a towable device <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> from a remote location. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21, a</cross-reference> tow vehicle <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>, which is depicted by way of example only as being a power boat, includes an air compressor <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> and a power source <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> for the air compressor <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>. A compressed air supply line <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> may wrap around a towline <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> and may provide a supply of breathable compressed air to an operator <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> submerged below a water surface <highlight><bold>714</bold></highlight>. Thus, the operator <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> does not necessarily have to surface to breath and, as a result, may enjoy extended subsurface or underwater operation. The operator <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> may draw air from the air supply line <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> using conventional SCUBA breathing apparatus or any other suitable breathing apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> is an exemplary diagrammatic view of a buoyant indicator <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> that may be used with the towable device described herein. The indicator <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> may be coupled to a towline <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> so that as a tow vehicle <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> pulls an operator <highlight><bold>806</bold></highlight> below a water surface <highlight><bold>808</bold></highlight>, the buoyant indicator <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> moves along the towline <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> so that the buoyant indicator <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> remains floating on the water surface <highlight><bold>808</bold></highlight> and so that other boaters, skiers, etc., the driver of the tow vehicle <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> and any other persons in the vicinity may be warned of the approximate location of the submerged operator <highlight><bold>806</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference> is an exemplary diagrammatic view of a towline mechanism <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> that may be used with the towable device described herein. The towline mechanism <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> includes an elastic member <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> that is coupled to a towline <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> that extends through a nose or front portion <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> of a towable device chassis <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight> such as, for example, those described herein. The towline mechanism <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> may further include a latch <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight> that is fixed to the chassis <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight> and releasably coupled to the towline <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> and which may be actuated or controlled via a release cable <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight> and a release switch <highlight><bold>914</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>, one end <highlight><bold>916</bold></highlight> of the elastic member <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> may be coupled to the towline <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> adjacent to the latch <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight>, while another end <highlight><bold>918</bold></highlight> of the member <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> may be fixed to the chassis <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight>. The elastic member <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> may be implemented using, for example, a stretchable rope, an expansion spring, or any other suitable device or component that elongates in response to the towline <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> being pulled by a tow vehicle. Additionally, the elastic member <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> may be made from a plastic, a corrosion resistant metal, or any other material suited for use in a water or marine environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In operation, with the latch <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight> engaged (i.e., coupled to the towline <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>), the towable device is pulled by a tow vehicle from a point coincident with the latch <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, if an operator activates the release switch <highlight><bold>914</bold></highlight>, the release cable <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight> actuates the latch <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight> to release the towline <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>, which causes the elastic member <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> to elongate and increases the effective length of the towline <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>. With the latch <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight> released, the towable device is pulled by the tow vehicle from a point coincident with the end <highlight><bold>918</bold></highlight> of the elastic member <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight>. To limit extension of the towline <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> or to prevent the elastic member <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> from becoming overextended, a safety loop <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight> may be fixed to the ends <highlight><bold>916</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>918</bold></highlight> of the elastic member <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight>. The safety loop <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> is preferably, but not necessarily, made from a relatively inelastic material such as, for example, a low-stretch rope, a plastic or metal strap, a braided metal cable, or any other suitable material, device or component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The towline mechanism <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> may be used to dynamically provide additional towline length to facilitate increased airborne time during, for example, porpoising maneuvers. Of course, the elastic action of the member <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> facilitates the subsequent retraction of the towline <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> and a re-latching of the towline <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> in the original shortened condition. Still further, the elastic action of the member <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> provides a shock dampening characteristic, especially following an airborne condition during which the tow vehicle has maintained or increased its speed, the speed of the towable device has decreased and the towline <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> has become slack. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24 and 25</cross-reference> are exemplary front and side diagrammatic views, respectively, of a propulsion system <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> that may be used with the towable device described herein. The propulsion system <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> may include a water turbine <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> and one or more nozzles <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight>, all of which may be fixed to a chassis <highlight><bold>1006</bold></highlight> of the towable device. Preferably, but not necessarily, the water turbine <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> is approximately centrally located across the breadth of the chassis <highlight><bold>1006</bold></highlight> and may be located closer to a front portion <highlight><bold>1008</bold></highlight> of the chassis <highlight><bold>1006</bold></highlight>. In any event, the water turbine <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> may be fixed to the chassis <highlight><bold>1006</bold></highlight> to facilitate the intake of water as the towable device is towed through a body of water. Additionally, the location of the nozzles <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> may be selected to achieve a desired operational characteristic. For example, locating the nozzles <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> nearer to a rear portion <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight> of the chassis <highlight><bold>1006</bold></highlight> may increase maneuverability, whereas locating the nozzles <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> nearer to the front portion <highlight><bold>1008</bold></highlight> of the chassis <highlight><bold>1006</bold></highlight> may result in greater stability but decreased maneuverability. Furthermore, the nozzles <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> may be mounted on pivots <highlight><bold>1012</bold></highlight> that allow the nozzles <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> to rotate about a transverse axis of the chassis <highlight><bold>1006</bold></highlight>. In this manner, the nozzles <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> may be oriented to provide thrust in a desired direction to achieve a desired operational characteristic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference> is an exemplary sectional side view of a nozzle assembly <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight> that may be used with the towable device propulsion system described herein. The nozzle assembly <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight> includes a nozzle body <highlight><bold>1022</bold></highlight> and a controllable baffle <highlight><bold>1024</bold></highlight> that may be rotated about a pivot <highlight><bold>1026</bold></highlight>, which is adjacent to an exit <highlight><bold>1028</bold></highlight> of the nozzle assembly <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight>. Generally speaking, the position of the controllable baffle <highlight><bold>1024</bold></highlight> may be varied as desired to change the thrust vector (i.e., the direction or trajectory in which water exits the nozzle body <highlight><bold>1022</bold></highlight>) of the nozzle assembly <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight>. The baffle <highlight><bold>1024</bold></highlight> preferably, but not necessarily, has an oblong footprint and is relatively thin and flat. Additionally, the baffle <highlight><bold>1024</bold></highlight> may be adjustably fixed in a desired position (i.e., at a desired angle) or, alternatively, the baffle <highlight><bold>1024</bold></highlight> may be controlled via a cable so that the angle or position of the baffle <highlight><bold>1024</bold></highlight> may be varied dynamically (i.e., while the towable device is being towed through a body of water). Still further, the nozzle body <highlight><bold>1022</bold></highlight> may be mounted on a pivot <highlight><bold>1030</bold></highlight> so that the nozzle assembly <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight> may be rotated in an identical or similar manner to the nozzles <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> described above in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25 and 26</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference> is a more detailed diagrammatic view of the propulsion system <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25 and 26</cross-reference>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>, the propulsion system <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> includes a storage tank <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight>, a water bag or bladder <highlight><bold>1052</bold></highlight>, an air valve <highlight><bold>1054</bold></highlight>, a pressure relief valve <highlight><bold>1056</bold></highlight>, a check valve <highlight><bold>1058</bold></highlight>, a pump <highlight><bold>1060</bold></highlight>, water release or gate valves <highlight><bold>1061</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1062</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1063</bold></highlight>, valve control cables <highlight><bold>1064</bold></highlight> and a valve switch <highlight><bold>1066</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> In operation, as the towable device is pulled through a body of water, the water turbine <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> drives the pump <highlight><bold>1060</bold></highlight> to cause water to be pumped through the check valve <highlight><bold>1058</bold></highlight> into the bladder <highlight><bold>1052</bold></highlight>. As water is pumped into the bladder <highlight><bold>1052</bold></highlight>, the pressure within the bladder <highlight><bold>1052</bold></highlight> increases and the bladder <highlight><bold>1052</bold></highlight> expands into an air cavity <highlight><bold>1068</bold></highlight> formed between the bladder <highlight><bold>1052</bold></highlight> and the tank <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight>. If desired, additional pressure may be provided via the air valve <highlight><bold>1054</bold></highlight>, which may, for example, be a Schrader type valve, or any other suitable valve, that is connected to a source of high pressure air or and other suitable pressurized gas. The pressure relief valve <highlight><bold>1056</bold></highlight> prevents dangerous or potentially damaging pressures from being developed within the bladder <highlight><bold>1052</bold></highlight> and storage tank <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>, two of the water release gates <highlight><bold>1062</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1063</bold></highlight> are located adjacent to the nozzles <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> within respective output passages <highlight><bold>1070</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1072</bold></highlight> of a manifold <highlight><bold>1074</bold></highlight>. The third or primary water release gate <highlight><bold>1061</bold></highlight> is located between the passages <highlight><bold>1070</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1072</bold></highlight> and an input passage <highlight><bold>1076</bold></highlight> of the manifold <highlight><bold>1074</bold></highlight> that receives high pressure water from the bladder <highlight><bold>1052</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The water release gates <highlight><bold>1061</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1063</bold></highlight> are controlled via the release cables <highlight><bold>1064</bold></highlight> and the switch <highlight><bold>1066</bold></highlight>. In operation, the water release gates <highlight><bold>1061</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1063</bold></highlight> may be opened and closed in various combinations to produce a desired thrust characteristic. By way of example, if the water release gates <highlight><bold>1062</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1063</bold></highlight> are set to an open condition (i.e., allowing the passage of high pressure water through the gate) and if the primary water release gate <highlight><bold>1061</bold></highlight> is initially closed and then rapidly opened, an approximately equal thrust may be delivered at the outputs of the nozzles <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight>. Of course, a similar condition (i.e., approximately equal thrusts) may be achieved by setting the primary water release gate <highlight><bold>1061</bold></highlight> in an open condition while the gates <highlight><bold>1062</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1063</bold></highlight> are initially in a closed condition and then are suddenly opened. Also, for example, the water release gates <highlight><bold>1062</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1063</bold></highlight> may be opened in an unequal manner to facilitate certain maneuvers such as rolling about the longitudinal axis of the towable device. </paragraph>
