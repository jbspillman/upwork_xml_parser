<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> This invention relates, in general, to a posture friendly backpack, and, in particular, to a soft back pack having an angular bottom and back formed of relatively stiff fabric combined with a relatively wide lumbar belt to comfortably distribute the weight of the pack from the shoulders and neck area to the gluetus maximus and hips (torso). Also, this pack features novel, uniquely positioned, S-shaped shoulder straps that supports and distributes weight comfortably and improves lateral stability of the pack. Each of the backpack&apos;s major elements, including its angular bottom, lumbar belt and shoulder straps are designed to function individually, as well as collectively as part of the pack&apos;s suspension system, which safely distributes the weight to those parts of the human anatomy best suited for bearing loads. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Description of the Prior Art: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Various packs, especially backpacks, are well known in the art. The two most common types in use today consist of the so-called &ldquo;hard packs&rdquo; and &ldquo;soft packs&rdquo;. The hard pack is generally employed for serious, long-distance hiking or carrying heavy loads on the back and usually consists of a rigid metal or plastic frame to which the cargo area, shoulder straps and waist band are normally attached. Cinching up the waist band allows the weight of this pack to be transferred to the waist and hips of the user. Such packs are bulky and not easily stored, and their large size makes them totally unsuited for use by students or day hikers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Soft packs, by contrast, are usually used by students carrying books around campus or by hikers on excursions when the weight to be borne is 25 pounds or less. Such packs have shoulder straps and (may) have a waist band; however, the straps tend to cut into the shoulder of the user, and the cloth cargo area and flimsy waist band do not distribute weight properly, evenly or comfortably. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In the prior art, various types of hard and soft packs have been proposed. Hard packs are those with metal, plastic or wooden frames. Many hard packs have lumbar straps which attach the rigid frame to the wearer&apos;s lumbar region in order to support much of the pack&apos;s weight on the user&apos;s waist and hips. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Eastern Mountain Sports, Inc., as well as other outdoor equipment retailers, sell a soft backpack that has S-shaped straps and a quilted, relatively stiff back that upon cursory examination may appear similar to the pack of the instant invention; however, the Eastern Mountain pack has straps that attach to the pack top at a spacing of about 3 inches and come straight over the shoulder and curve out. Some soft backpack manufacturers use plastic or metal inserts in attempts to stiffen the frame of soft backpacks in order to relieve the strain of a heavy load on the wearer&apos;s upper back. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to a backpack designed to be comfortable and promote good posture. The backpack delivers such comfort and posture-benefits when carrying a load by a number of features, acting both individually and collectively, that are designed into the pack&apos;s suspension system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The present invention is a soft pack (as defined above in description of the prior art), meaning that it is crushable, foldable and may be placed in a washing machine whole to be cleaned. My invention is a soft pack that delivers to the wearer the major advantage of a hard pack (as defined above) which is its transference of weight from the user&apos;s vulnerable neck and shoulder regions to the gluteus maximus and hips (torso area). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> While prior art shoulder straps, such as those on the Eastern Mountain Sports backpack come straight over the shoulder and curve out, my straps start in the center of the pack and curve out from behind the neck, then in, then out again for improved stability and comfort. This positioning ensures that the shoulder straps do not put pressure on the clavicle and/or thoracic outlet region of the wearer and/or the breasts of the female wearer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> First, in the shoulder region I have provided wide S-shaped straps that originate in the center of the back and extend out and over the shoulders. Most packs of this sort have straight straps attached at spaced locations. Other commercial packs have straps attached at spaced locations and a very slight curve. I have found that by having straps that come together in the center of the back and extending out from each other at a angle of about 45 degrees and then curving in, that the resulting shape improves the stability and feel of the pack and limits the tendency of the straps to fall away from the shoulder when the pack weight is supported by the lumbar strap. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> A second novel feature of the invention is its wide-padded lumbar belt, which attaches to a relatively stiff fabric back and to a relatively stiff fabric bottom panel. The back and bottom panels create an angle ranging from 45 degrees to 75 degrees, with an average and optimal angle of about 60 degrees. This combination of features transfers load to the gluteus maximus and hip region of the body without the cantilever action or lever arm effect that is produced by a square bottomed pack. (With such a prior art backpack, the wearer must lean forward in order to compensate for the load being carried.) With my invention this lever arm effect is avoided and there is an anatomically proper transfer of load from the neck and shoulder region to the gluteus maximus and hip region; such a weight transfer is accomplished without the need for a rigid frame or hard pack. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide a new and improved backpack that comfortably distributes the weight carried by the pack to the hips and waist. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> It is a further object of the present invention to provide a new and improved backpack that promotes good posture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> It is a further object of the present invention to provide a new and improved backpack having wide, comfortable, S-shaped shoulder straps that flow over the shoulders in a natural way and reduce pressure on the wearer&apos;s neck and shoulder region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> These and other objects and advantages of the present invention will be fully apparent from the following description, when reviewed in conjunction with the annexed drawings.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the drawings in greater detail, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 2</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> show a side view, a perspective view and a back view respectively of a pack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in accordance with this invention, having a relatively stiff fabric bottom panel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a relatively stiff fabric back panel <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, and triangular or trapezoidal side panels <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Wide padded lumbar straps <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are provided at the bottom. Each lumbar strap is of two-part construction and composed of a strap portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> measuring about 1.75 to 3 inches in width. Attached to this by stitching on all four sides are generally rectangular pads, pad <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> on the right and pad <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> on the left, which contact the body for a distance of some 4 to 8 inches. Both straps are stitched along the side seam <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to panels <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and to relatively stiff fabric back panel <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> on the left and right sides respectively, and to second triangular panels <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> As can be seen in the drawings, side panels <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are either triangular or trapezoidal, having a base similar in width to lumbar strap pads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The back panel is relatively stiff due to the fact that it is at least a three ply laminate consisting of a breathable soft mesh which faces the wearer&apos;s back, a somewhat stiff compressible foam layer, and a layer of heavy fabric on the inside of the zippered main compartment <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. For purposes of this specification the term &ldquo;slightly stiff&rdquo; is defined as being the stiffness of one-quarter-inch-thick wool felt compressed to the approximate degree used in making western style hats. The padding has two different functions. In the zippered main compartment it separates lumpy or angular objects such as books from the user&apos;s back. Toward the bottom of the pack, it forms a cup or tub. Relatively stiff back <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is stitched along a lower seam to a similarly formed relatively stiff bottom panel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and the relatively stiff panels <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> combine with the side panels <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to form a stiff but deformable cup or tub having a depth defined by the large base seam <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the trapezoidal or triangular panels <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> . This cup (or tub) when combined with straps <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> forms a self-supporting shelf that acts in place of a rigid frame to transfer load through the wide lumbar straps or belt to the gluteus maximus and hips. Because all panels are relatively stiff fabric, the cup or tub can change shape to conform to the body of the user. The angle of the bottom relative to the back is between 45 degrees and 75 degrees, and most preferably around 60 degrees. This critical angle between the back pad and bottom is maintained by the wrap-around padding formed by the back pad <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the lumbar strap and padding <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> for loads of up to 25 pounds carried in the pack. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The operation of the relatively stiff fabric back panel <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the relatively stiff fabric bottom panel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is best explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> which shows a cross section through the back and bottom panels. The back panel <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> consists of a first layer of material <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> which is an open mesh fabric designed to breathe and dissipate perspiration. This layer rests against the wearer&apos;s back and is supported by a second layer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> consisting of dense foam of about one-quarter-inch in thickness, and a final layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of high-strength, tightly woven material that forms the interior of the pack. The three layers are quilted together to give the panel its stiffness and are joined to the relatively stiff fabric bottom panel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> along a horizontal seam <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. The relatively stiff fabric bottom panel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has a layer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of one-quarter-inch foam similar to that of the back panel <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, but covered with layers <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of tightly woven, tear-resistant fabric. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6</cross-reference>, when a wearer puts on the pack and tightens the lumbar straps, the pack must change shape to match the curvature of the wearer&apos;s back along seam <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. If the relatively stiff bottom panel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> extended at a right angle to the back panel <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, as is the case with most packs, then the bottom panel would resist this change in curvature by digging into the wearer&apos;s back. However, because these panels come together at an acute angle, both panels will bend with a resulting slight change in the relative angle of the panels <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> about seam <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. The result is a load-bearing shelf that shapes itself to the back and lumbar region of whomever is wearing the pack. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> At the top of the pack there is a top/side panel <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which forms part of the top and sides of zippered main compartment <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which is opened and closed by zipper <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Panel <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> extends across the top and at least part way down both sides of the pack. The top/side panel <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> forms a seam <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> with the relatively stiff fabric back panel <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and a pair of S-shaped straps <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of about 16 inches in length attached to the top center <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of this seam at an angle of about 45 degrees. While this angle may be varied somewhat, it is important that the straps curve first out and then back in across the shoulders, then out again across the chest. Also, it is important that the straps are fabricated from stiff but flexible material. I have chosen a three layer quilted material that provides both cushioning and a degree of stiffness such that the straps will maintain their curve and posture-correct position on the shoulders when weights of up to 25 pounds are loaded in the pack. The outer layer (that facing away from the user) is a sturdy nylon or Dacron fabric. The inner layer is a breathable soft mesh material and the central layer is a crushable or compressible padding such as foam so that, in use, the inner mesh and the padding are crushed up against the stiff outer layer of fabric. This gives the pack a remarkable stability and comfort&mdash;benefits not afforded by straps that come straight over the shoulder, or even by those straps that have the slight curve in them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The S-shaped straps <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are connected to thin adjustable straps <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> which are, in turn, connected at their lower end to second triangular panels <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. These triangular panels are connected to the same vertical seam as triangular or trapezoidal panels <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, back panel <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and lumbar belt or straps <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The whole arrangement forms a snugly fitting, load bearing pack that shapes itself to the body of the user and transfers load to the user&apos;s body by both shoulder straps and by a deformable cup or tub attached to a lumbar belt or strap. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In addition to the features discussed above, the pack further includes a mesh pouch <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and a pager or cell phone pocket <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. A zippered pouch <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for keys or money is provided, stitched over the strap <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and lumbar padding <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The wearer may access this pouch from the front without opening the pack or removing it from his back. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> A wide comfortable handle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is stitched to seam <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> above straps <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a pack <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> in accordance with the prior art where the weight is carried by the shoulders and neck region, forcing the wearer to lean forward in order to counteract the cantilever forces caused by the shape of the bag and location at which the weight is borne. The reaction by the wearer to a load carried in this manner creates an unhealthy and abnormal forward curvature of the spine <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> resulting in poor posture. Evidence suggests that the heavy loads carried by people of all ages (particularly by children and adolescents) in their backpacks place unhealthy pressure and stress upon the wearer&apos;s vital nerves and blood vessels that lie under the muscles of the neck and thoracic outlet region <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, compressing and potentially damaging them. Repeated stress and compression of a kind caused by backpacks of unsound design can lead to a lifetime of health problems such as nerve damage, circulatory problems or spinal injuries. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> When heavy weight carried by the user of a pack causes the user to lean forward to balance the weight over the body, this undue stress leads to poor posture which, over time, can lead to muscular imbalances, spinal subluxations and spinal misalignment which can, in turn, lead to chronic spinal problems, shoulder problems, neck pain and lower back pain. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows a pack in accordance with this invention with bottom panel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and one of the side panels <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> being pulled in by the lumbar strap or belt so that the stiff padded back panel <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> conforms to the shape of the gluteus maximus <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and lower back. When the applicant&apos;s Posture Friendly Backpack is worn properly, the padded lumbar belt and the angular bottom work together to allow the weight carried by the pack to rest comfortably on the sacral base <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and gluteus maximus <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the wearer. This also helps in the transfer of the weight being carried from the neck and shoulders to the torso. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The two S-shaped shoulder straps <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> meet in the center where they attach to the top center seam of the pack. Such placement is strategic in that it allows the S-shaped straps to flow diagonally and laterally from this posterior center over the top of the trapezius and anterior deltoid muscles. As the wide strap comes across these muscles, the pack weight placed on the shoulder appears to diminish because it is spread more equally across a wide area of muscle surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In contrast, a standard shoulder strap (even an S-shaped strap without the strategic placement) concentrates its weight on one small band of the trapezium, sternocleidomastoid or deltoid muscles (depending on placement). As these thoracic muscles are compressed by the weight of the pack, conventional straps exert an abnormal pressure on the vulnerable nerves and blood vessels that rest below the muscle tissue. This thoracic outlet region <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> houses the vital brachial plexus (nerves that control the upper extremity) and the subclavian, carotid and jugular arteries and veins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The Posture-Friendly Backpack&apos;s S-shaped straps flow laterally and diagonally across the shoulder, the clavicle and the top of the pectoralis major muscles, ensuring that the straps do not put pressure on the neck, clavicle and/or the breasts (for female wearers). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The elements above comprise the Posture Friendly Backpack Suspension System which, when used correctly, promotes proper posture and supports the normal anterior-posterior curves <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of the spine. Maintaining these curves is vital to a lifetime of good spinal health. Based upon my research and experience as a chiropractor and on chiropractic research from across North America, numerous health problems are now linked to children wearing poorly designed traditional backpacks. If children abuse their spines at an early age by wearing such packs they can develop spinal problems that may last them a lifetime. The Posture Friendly Backpack and its unique suspension system provides a healthy alternative to this growing problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Although the Posture Friendly Backpack and the method of using the same according to the present invention has been described in the foregoing specification with considerable details, it is to be understood that modifications may be made to the invention which do not exceed the scope of the appended claims, and modified forms of the present invention done by others skilled in the art to which the invention pertains will be considered infringements of this invention when those modified forms fall within the claimed scope of this invention. </paragraph>
