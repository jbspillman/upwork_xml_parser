<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention generally relates to ledges, and more particularly, to multi-option combination ledges of above-ground swimming pools. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The popularity of swimming pools, particularly in residential areas, continues to increase. This increased popularity is based at least in part on the availability of aesthetically appealing above-ground pools, whose durability permits cost-effective purchasing by consumers. Above-ground pools additionally are particularly useful in areas where substantial excavation is either impermissible or undesirable. In densely-populated regions, for example, residential lawns may not be sufficiently large to accommodate the space required for in-ground pools. Moreover, in some cases they may be inadequate to accommodate the equipment necessary to excavate in-ground pools, even if space for such pools exists. Alternatively, above-ground pools may be preferable because of the decreased time typically needed for installation (and, if necessary, removal) or the lesser maintenance requirements and costs often associated with them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Above-ground pools are typically constructed of steel, aluminum or molded thermoplastic and typically use the same components regardless of the materials. Ordinarily, the components making up the framework for an above-ground pool include rail sections connected to separate base plates; vertical uprights or posts set on the base plates; coping or ledge sections normally connected together or continuous over the posts; and cap members to cover the joints over the posts. A flexible side retaining wall of sheet metal or relatively thick plastic is typically provided and is held in the rail by the coping. A liner, normally of flexible vinyl plastic, covers the ground and the interior of the wall and is supported on the upper edge of the retaining wall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Various materials have been used to manufacture the components of above-ground pools. For example, for pool walls, U.S. Pat. No. 5,815,853 discloses a pool wall material made of a laminate of woven polypropylene mesh fabric and polypropylene sheets. This material is intended to improve upon plastic walls that may break and dump water. Instead of bursting if the pool wall fails, strands of the mesh will break and the water will slowly seep from the wall. The material is also intended to reduce the weight of the pool wall. A flexible U-shaped coping is used to secure the liner to the upper edges of the pool wall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,054,135 to Dallaire et al. is directed to an above-ground swimming pool with a specific coping configuration that extends along the top of pool posts. The coping has a shoulder, reinforcing ribs, and a groove to connect with a locking strip. The reference does not, however, discuss or suggest any possible materials or options for the coping, such as the concept that the coping could comprise different durometers, colors, textures, and the like as disclosed herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 3,874,132 to Mendelow et al. is directed to a swimming pool ledge structure that is intended to permit accurate assembly and eliminate &ldquo;numerous unnecessary parts,&rdquo; as opposed to the precise alignment needed for the numerous parts required by the prior art. The ledge consists of a plurality of individual one-piece, single ledge members. Each ledge member has two legs, one of which faces the inside of the pool and provides a bumper on the interior of the pool to prevent inadvertent contact with the top edge of the side wall. The ledge is made from plastic, without suggestion that the ledge can be made from different types of materials. There is no implication that the &ldquo;bumper&rdquo; function of the ledge is being provided by a different material than that making up the remainder of the ledge. The &ldquo;bumper&rdquo; actually refers to the protection of the side wall, not protection from a harder portion of the ledge itself. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 3,302,825 to Schleeweiss illustrates a swimming pool that has a metal side wall permanently united to a plastic bottom. At its top, the metal side wall has metal strips that are folded upon themselves and interposed between edges of a channel. The channel is preferably made of the same metal. A coping tube, which can be of a light metal, synthetic or natural rubber, or a suitable plastic, is split and forced over the folded-down channel. This reference does not disclose or suggest a ledge that has different types of materials. Nor does it suggest the benefits obtained by having a softer durometer portion comprising a portion of the ledge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 3,193,847 to Mashura describes a collapsible swimming pool that is mounted to a groove in a cement patio or similar structure. The reference particularly describes the way that the base of the pool is water sealed, etc., and does not discuss the upper portion of the pool in any detail at all. The reference does state that between the wall halves and at a joint, &ldquo;there is placed a gasket which can be made of rubber, cork or the like.&rdquo; This does not, however, suggest any possible configurations or materials, etc. for the upper portion of the pool, nor the concept that such an upper portion or ledge can be different durometers, colors, textures, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 3,045,254 to Cook et al. describes the combination of a bathtub with a compressible liner. The liner is attached to the tub by a series of flanges. The liner is composed of an outer layer of semi-flexible water impervious sheet material and an inner layer of compressible material, such as foam rubber. The compressible layer provides cushioning for occupants of the tub without undue collapse. The surface of the plastic outer layer has inherent anti-slip characteristics which prevent sliding and slipping by occupants of the tub. The outer layer of the liner can also be colored and/or embossed with designs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Although this reference describes two types of materials in combination, it seeks to provide a bathtub liner for comfort, decorative, and anti-slip purposes. It does not suggest that the two-material combination would be useful or beneficial for use in conjunction with pool ledges. Furthermore, the liner is attached to the tub via a set of flanges and is not securely or even semi-permanently attached to the tub. Additionally, the outer harder layer completely covers the inner softer layer. In other words, the softer material is located beneath the harder layer for cushioning support of the harder layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> There is a need in the art to provide innovative and advanced materials for pool ledges. Such pool ledges will allow the user increased options. Pool ledges provided for above-ground pools comprise only one type of material. Most pool ledges are currently manufactured from steel, aluminum or very hard plastic, without providing any additional material features or options. If there are any other features associated with the ledge, they are typically connecting mechanisms, such as bolts or fasteners and the like, and not additional enhanced features, such as varying materials, durometers, textures, colors, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Thus, there is need in the art to provide pool ledges comprised of multiple materials. For example, some materials may be more resistant to water and rust problems, but may not necessarily be the most desirable material to make up the entire pool ledge. On the other hand, other materials may provide strength and stability, but may be slippery, rust-prone, or otherwise dangerous to the user. For example, a split or broken metal or aluminum ledge can cause injury to swimmers or other users having contact with the pool, whereas split rubber or neoprene is much less likely to cause injury. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Additionally, there is a need to provide pool ledges that have materials of varying durometer or density. Pool ledges that are manufactured from only the inflexible materials currently used may cause injuries to those entering and exiting the pool. To the contrary, a pool having only a flexible ledge would not provide the support needed for entering and exiting the pool, as well as the support needed to maintain the positioning of the entire structure. Moreover, if flexible material were located beneath a harder layer rather than disposed over the harder layer, the benefits sought to be achieved by this invention would be somewhat lessened. Thus, there is a need to combine both features of hardness and relative softness in combination ledges to provide pool ledges that are sturdy, yet pliable to some degree. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, there is a need to provide pool ledges that comprise multiple textures. Current pool ledges typically have a consistent texture throughout. Providing a varied texture, such as a textured grabbing surface on the ledge, can reduce the occurrence of slipping on the ledge, while enhancing the swimmer&apos;s ability to exit the pool. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> There is also a need in the art for pool ledges that have multiple materials and multiple color schemes. Traditionally, the entire ledge is of the same color, without purposeful variation. Providing ledges having two or more materials that are two or more different colors or different shades of the same color is desirable for aesthetic purposes. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Above-ground swimming pool ledges are traditionally formed from the same material throughout. To the contrary, the present invention relates to the concept of using two types of material on an above-ground swimming pool ledge. This invention generally provides a way to add an additional feature to ledge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The two materials <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> exist together on a single ledge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> show generally pool ledges <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> being formed from two varying materials. Generally, a first material <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> provides the structure of the ledge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and a second material <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (shown cross-hatched) is disposed on, attached to, or otherwise related to the first material <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Second material <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and first material <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be joined in a number of ways, including but not limited to mechanically attachment, adhesive attachment, attachment through a heating or melting process, co-injection, or co-extrusion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> As shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the first material <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may provide the structural and rigidity requirements of the design, and a second material <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may provide an alternate feature, such as being a different material, a different durometer, a different texture, or a different color, or any combination thereof. In one embodiment, second material <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may include, but is not limited to a plastic-based polymer material, monoprene, neoprene, rubber, foam, gel, copolymer, polyvinyl chloride, polyurethane, or any combination thereof, while first material <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may include, but is not limited to a metal-based material, aluminum, steel, resin, fiberglass, or any combination thereof, or any other material that may be used to form above-ground pool ledges. Providing both materials <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> on the same ledge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> allows the consumer to benefit from features of both materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> For example, varying the materials that comprise ledge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> allows the manufacturer to account for the fact that some materials exhibit greater wear, water resistance, and rust resistance than other materials. For example, plastic or polymers are less likely to rust than metal, less likely to retain heat during hot months, and less likely to become jagged and cause a serious injury if split, but in some instances may not be as sturdy as a metal-based material. Thus, by forming a portion of ledge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> out of a first material <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and by forming an additional component of ledge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> out of a second material <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the benefits of both materials are combined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the present invention, second material <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is of a different durometer, and is preferably softer than the first material <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, to provide possible enhanced safety and an aesthetic appearance. In this embodiment, the second material <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is positioned to cover at least a portion of the ledge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the second material <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> extends toward the inside <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the pool ledge, i.e., the side of the pool ledge that corresponds to the inside of the pool, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The softer material <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> could be a variety of materials such as monoprene-like substances (rubber-like), neoprene, foam, rubber, plastic, styrofoam, gel, co-polymer, polyvinyl chloride, polyurethane, or any other material that provides a soft, cushiony feel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> This embodiment can conceivably help prevent or minimize injuries that may occur if the user collides with ledge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. It also provides a more comfortable surface on which the user may rest. Although not shown, it is also possible for second material <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to extend the length of ledge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and substantially or completely cover first material <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Additionally, in this and other embodiments, second material <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be a different thickness from first material <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> or may have varying thickness throughout, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Reference numeral <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> indicates a thickness of first material <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and reference number <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> indicates a varying thickness of second material <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> at or about the same location on ledge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, second material <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> itself may have a plurality of thicknesses at various points, as shown by exemplary reference numeral <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, indicating a greater thickness of second material <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> at top <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of ledge than at inside <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of ledge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In a further embodiment, second material <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may provide a textured surface <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Textured surface <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> provides a number of advantages. For example, among other functions, textured surface <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> helps provide slip resistance, so that a user entering or exiting the pool or sitting on ledge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> would have added traction with respect to ledge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Textured surface <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> has undulations or indentations <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> that may retain water and draw it away from top surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of ledge. Additionally, textured surface <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> can provide a grabbing surface on the ledge, so that if a user is attempting to grasp the ledge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to exit the pool, the ledge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> provides some added resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Additionally, second material <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may have a contrasting color from that of the first material <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. This color contrast adds aesthetic value to the ledge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. For example, if second material <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> extends to the inside <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the ledge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, it may provide a brighter color for the inside of the pool, whereas first material <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> provides a more subdued color for the outside of the pool. There is, of course, a myriad of color combinations that would be apparent to one skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Although suitable materials have been described for the elements of the invention, it is anticipated that future research will produce alternatives to the materials described herein. The future existence of such materials which may be used in conjunction with the present invention shall not limit the breadth thereof. The spirit of the invention is the concept that the first and second materials differ in some way from one another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The particular embodiments of the invention having been described above are not limiting of the present invention, and those of skill in the art can readily determine that additional embodiments and features of the invention are within the scope of the appended claims and equivalents thereto. </paragraph>
