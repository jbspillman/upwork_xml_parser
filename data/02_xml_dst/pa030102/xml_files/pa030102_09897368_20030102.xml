<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The invention comprises a water distribution mechanism for an evaporative air conditioner that alleviates splashing of water out of that mechanism. Further, the invention alleviates the problem of water running horizontally along a distribution edge of a water distribution mechanism to drip off at the lowest point. To compensate for the splashing problem, the invention comprises a structure that requires the water exiting the water distribution mechanism strike at least one surface of the water distribution mechanism on its way down. To compensate for the problem of water running horizontally because of sags and the like, the invention comprises a plurality of teeth along the bottom edge of the water distribution bonnet that therefore forces the water to drip rather than to move horizontally. Another aspect of the invention comprises a plurality of modular troughs and housings that may be advantageously connected or bolted together to create an evaporative air conditioning system of an appropriate size given the size of the poultry house to be cooled. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to evaporative cooling systems. More particularly, the preferred embodiment of the present invention relates to a water distribution system for evaporative coolers for poultry houses. Owners and operators of poultry houses have ordinary skill in this art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> 2. Background of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In the operation of poultry houses, whether for housing broiler chickens or for producing eggs, it is important to keep animals cool, even in the hottest months of the summer. Because the square footage of poultry houses may exceed several thousand square feet, the cost and expense of operating refrigerated air conditioning to keep the poultry houses at the proper temperature is prohibitively expensive, not only from a capital outlay standpoint, but also from standpoint of paying monthly energy bills. With those factors in mind, most owners/operators of poultry houses cool those houses by means of evaporative air conditioning. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a simplified perspective view of an evaporative cooling system for a poultry house. In particular, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows four fans <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A-D. These fans <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A-D are designed to pull air through the poultry house <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. During some times of the year, this air flow alone may be sufficient to keep the animals within the house at the desired temperature. However, in the hotter part of the year, the air flow alone may be insufficient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Referring still to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, there is shown an evaporative air conditioning panel <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> on a side of the poultry house <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Although the drawing of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows the evaporative air conditioning system panel <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> on a side of the poultry house <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, this likewise may be placed at any location generally opposite of the fans <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A-D. Further, multiple panels <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> may be used, e.g. one on each side of the poultry house. Generally speaking, the evaporative air conditioning panel <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> comprises a water distribution mechanism, and a corrugated paper pad soaked with water. As air moves through the corrugated paper pad, drawn by the cooling fans <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A-D, the air is cooled by heat loss to the evaporation of the water in the corrugated pads. In this way, a temperature drop is seen across the corrugated paper pad, as well as a corresponding humidity increase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> More particularly, and referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the evaporative air conditioning unit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> may comprise the corrugated paper pad <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, water is typically allowed to flow through the pad in the direction of gravity, while air flow is typically at right angles to that water flow. Water is typically applied to the corrugated paper pad <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> by means of a water distribution mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Water that is not evaporated off or otherwise soaked up by the corrugated pad <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is collected in a basin <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which flows to a sump (not shown). From the sump, a pump moves the water back to the inlet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the water distribution mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and the process continues. Any water lost in the system to evaporation or spillage (which is discussed more fully below) is replaced at the sump. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In this day of water conservation and environmental concern, it is becoming increasingly important to minimize water waste. Moreover, some environmental agencies, e.g., the Environmental Protection Agency, may already, or will in the future, tightly regulated water usage and water waste. In that respect, the evaporative air conditioning systems for poultry houses of the prior art are deficient in their design and construction for their waste of water and inefficiencies in water consumption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, there is shown a cross-sectional view of a prior art evaporative air conditioning system taken substantially along line <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Although the prior art may be deficient in many respects, of particular concern in this application is the water distribution mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In particular, the prior art water distribution mechanism comprises at least a bonnet <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and a spray pipe <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The spray pipe <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> has on its inside water at a pressure higher than atmospheric. The spray pipe <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> further has a plurality of small holes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> drilled in the top which allows that water to escape in an upward direction. As indicated by the dashed lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the water typically strikes the bonnet <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and then splatters and falls down toward the corrugated paper pad <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. However, the bonnet <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the prior art devices is deficient in at least two ways. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The first way the prior art bonnet is deficient is that it does not adequately stop or slow water splattering from the top of the bonnet toward the corrugated paper pad <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Prior art bonnets <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are typically made by splitting a section of pipe in half, thus making both halves available for bonnet service. Referring still to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, there is shown a pie-shaped region alpha through which water that strikes the bonnet directly above the spray pipe <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may move without impediment toward the corrugated pad <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Support <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, while shown in the particular cross-section, is a periodically spaced support for the spray pipe <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and thus presents no impediment to water movement, except for the few locations where the support <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is located. Depending upon the height of the spray pipe <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and bonnet <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> above the corrugated pad <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, it is possible that water may splatter off the bonnet <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and effectively spray beyond the outer edge <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the corrugated paper pad <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Water that does not reach the corrugated paper pad <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> in these prior art systems thus falls to the ground, either inside or outside the unit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and is wasted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The second prior art deficiency in the use of water is improper distribution of water across the corrugated paper pad <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. In particular, for most efficient operation of the evaporative air conditioning system <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, it is important that water flow down the corrugated paper pad <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> be evenly distributed. Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, there is shown a side-view of the bonnet <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> taken substantially along line <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> thus shows, in an exaggerated manner, that the bonnet <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the spray pipe <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) may sag for various reasons, including inadequate support. It has been discovered that in situations where the bonnet <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> sags, water does not drip from the bonnet evenly. Rather, and still referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the water that reaches the lower edge of the bonnet at a higher elevation, e.g., point <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>A, tends to run in the direction indicated by the arrow of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> toward the lowest elevation of the bonnet <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and drip from the lowest point, e.g. point <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>B. This phenomenon makes the distribution of water across the corrugated paper pad <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> uneven, lowers the efficiency of the evaporative air conditioning system <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and when a particular portion of the corrugated paper pad <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> becomes excessively wet, it tends to cause further water waste. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Thus, what is needed in the art is a water distribution mechanism that does not allow the water to spray unimpeded toward the corrugated paper pad, that compensates for differences in elevation of the bonnet covering spray pipe, that minimizes water waste, and that is easy to assemble. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The problems noted above are solved in large part by a novel spray bar and bonnet arrangement. In particular, the bonnet and spray bar are configured such that for water to exit the water distribution mechanism at all, it preferably has to drip. That is, there is preferably relatively few, if any, exit paths from the water distribution mechanism that form a straight line between top dead center of the bonnet and the corrugated paper pad below. In this way, water must strike at least two surfaces of the water distribution mechanism before falling onto the corrugated paper pad, and thus is not allowed to splatter out of the spray pipe and bonnet mechanism with much, if any, horizontal velocity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In a second aspect of the invention, the preferred embodiment of the bonnet itself has formed therein a plurality of teeth at the edge from which water drips, the drip surface, onto the corrugated paper pad. Having these teeth at the bottom portion of the bonnet therefore does not allow water to run along the lower edge when there are differences in elevation of the bottom of the bonnet. Thus, even in spite of sags or droops in the overall water distribution system, water droplets preferably drip off the first tooth they encounter on the drip portion of the bonnet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In a final aspect of the invention, the preferred embodiment comprises a structure that houses the water distribution mechanism, and a corresponding structure, near the bottom of the corrugated paper pad, that acts to support the pad, as well as a trough in which water that migrates completely through the pad is collected before moving by force of gravity to a sump. Construction of the lower trough advantageously includes flanges on each end of the trough such that standard length of trough may be connected together to create the overall evaporative air conditioning assembly, and to reduce water waste. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The preferred embodiment of the present invention has three aspects; a water distribution mechanism <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> that minimizes or alleviates splattering of the water from the bonnet <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> onto the corrugated paper pad <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>; a plurality of teeth <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> along the drip edge (the bottom portion) of the bonnet <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>; and an advantageous structure for housing the waste distribution mechanism and pad. Each of these will be addressed in turn. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, there is shown a cross-sectional view of a water distribution mechanism <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the preferred embodiment. In particular, the water distribution mechanism <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> comprises a cover or bonnet <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> having within its interior a spray pipe or spray bar <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The sectional view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows that the bonnet defines a partially enclosed region. The cross-sectional view of the prior art bonnet <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, made by splitting a pipe in half, spans an arc of 180 degrees, and does not extend below a lower surface of the spray bar <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The preferred spray bar <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) clearly spans an arc of greater than 180&deg;, and preferably spans approximately 270&deg;. Preferably, the bonnet <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is 3&Prime; Schedule 40 PVC pipe having an arcuate portion cut therefrom to form the opening <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Although PVC is the preferred material because of its availability, workability, and cost, any material may be used to create the bonnet <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> including steel, aluminum, wood, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Housed within the bonnet <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is the spray bar <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. Preferably, this spray bar has on its upward facing surface a plurality of holes <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> through which water, at high pressure within the spray pipe <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, is allowed to exit in an upward direction. The spray bar <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is preferably 1&Prime; Schedule 40 PVC. However, any suitable material may be used, including aluminum, steel, stainless steel and the like. The periodically spaced holes <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are preferably in {fraction (7/64)}&Prime; diameter and spaced 1&frac12;&Prime; apart. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The spray bar <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is preferably suspended within the bonnet <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> by means of a plurality hollow mounting brackets. In the preferred embodiment, those brackets are preferably of 2&Prime; stainless steel rings having a &frac38;&Prime; width. Although the ring <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is preferably stainless steel, any suitable material may be used. Further, 2&Prime; diameters need not necessarily be used, so long as other parameters (discussed below) are satisfied. Thus, the plurality of these stainless steel rings <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> are preferably connected by any suitable fastener in a spaced fashion on the inside of the bonnet <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> (only one such ring <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). The spray bar <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> preferably slides in the stainless steel ring <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> in a longitudinal fashion, and then rests by force of gravity on a lower portion of the stainless steel rings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In operation, water is forced into the spray bar <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> inside diameter under pressure. Because of the holes <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> in the upward facing surface of the spray bar <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, that water exits having a particular velocity, depending, in part upon the pressure of the water, toward an upper surface of the inside diameter of the spray bonnet <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. In particular, the water preferably strikes an inside upper portion of the bonnet: in the preferred semi-circular bonnet, the upper-most portion of the curvature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In the prior art, the water exiting and splashing or splattering off the inside of the bonnet could then move or fall out of the water distribution mechanism without contacting any further surfaces. That is, and referring again to the prior art drawing of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, water could splash off the upper inside diameter of the bonnet and have a direct path for movement out of the spray mechanism as indicated by the pie-shaped area &agr;. If the water distribution mechanism was situated high enough above the paper pad, or the air flow between the pad and the water distribution mechanism was strong enough, that water either sprayed beyond the pad to the ground, or was carried in droplet form by the moving air. The preferred embodiment of the present invention addresses that shortcoming of the prior art by adjusting the relative positions and sizes of the structures of the water distribution system <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to alleviate that problem. In particular, and referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the preferred embodiment has an arrangement of the bonnet <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and spray bar <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> such that water preferably contacts at least two interior surfaces before being allowed to drop or otherwise fall onto the corrugated paper pad. Stated differently, substantially all the water drips from the water distribution mechanism, be it from the drip surface of the bonnet or the spray bar, rather than splashing or spattering. In the preferred embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, this physical arrangement is accomplished by extending the sides of the bonnet <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> (the downwardly extending side walls) until substantially no direct line exists from top dead center <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> of the inside diameter of the bonnet to the exterior of the bonnet. The drawing of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows an arrangement of the bonnet <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and spray bar <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> which satisfies this parameter. As indicated, in the preferred embodiment, the bonnet <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is extended to alleviate this splashing problem. Stated otherwise, the downwardly extending side walls of the bonnet <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are arranged such that the opening <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is only slightly larger than the diameter of the spray bar. However, one of ordinary skill in the art, now understanding how to alleviate water loss associated with this phenomenon, could easily develop many arrangements to accomplish this. For example, the spray bar <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> could be moved closer to the top dead center <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> of the bonnet <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. However, because the preferred embodiment also envisions removal of the spray bar <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> on a periodic basis for cleaning, this alternative regarding embodiment regarding placement of the spray pipe <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> closer to the spray bonnet <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> creates problems in facilitating that removal, cleaning, and reinstallation. Further, the goals could be achieved by other baffle mechanisms within the spray bonnet <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> to block these splashing paths. These embodiments are significantly more complicated to build and maintain than the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, and thus are not preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> As alluded to in the paragraph immediately above, the preferred embodiments envision a spray bar <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> that may be removed from the overall water distribution mechanism <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> for cleaning purposes. Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, there is shown a partial cut-away view of the spray bar <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> within the bonnet <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the spray bar <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> rests on a lower portion of each of the stainless steel rings <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. Because in the preferred embodiment the spray bar <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is a 1&Prime; PVC pipe, and the stainless steel rings <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> are each preferably 2&Prime;, there is sufficient room within the stainless steel rings for removal of the spray bar <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. In particular, to remove the spray bar <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> requires closing the water supply at the valve <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, and disconnecting the universal connector <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. Once disconnected, the spray bar <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> may be removed from the water distribution mechanism <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> by sliding the bar in a horizontal fashion in the direction indicated by the arrow in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. Once removed, any debris accumulated in the spray pipe or blocking the holes <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>) may be cleaned and removed, and the spray bar <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> reinstalled by reversing the previously mentioned steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The second aspect of the invention compensates for irregularities in elevation at the drip portion of the bonnet <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, there is shown a structure of a bonnet <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> taken substantially along line <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. Of particular importance are the downwardly extending protrusions, in the preferred embodiment a plurality of teeth <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and notches <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> distributed about the lower or drip edge or drip surface of the bonnet <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. As previously mentioned, the bonnet <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is preferably made of 3&Prime; Schedule 40 PVC pipe. The teeth are preferably each &frac14;&Prime; wide and created by removing or notching the PVC along its lower edge, with the notch preferably being {fraction (3/16)}&Prime; wide. Although <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> only shows one side of the bonnet <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> having the teeth <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and notches <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, it will be understood that preferably each side of the bonnet <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> has these structures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The teeth <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and corresponding notches <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> address the problems of the water running horizontally along the drip edge of the bonnet <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to its lowest elevation. With these teeth <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and notches <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> present, water tends to run along the inside diameter of the bonnet <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and down onto one of these teeth <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. Even if the bonnet <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the preferred embodiment sags between connection points, the water drips from its corresponding tooth and does not run horizontally along the drip surface. In this way, the water is more evenly distributed along the corrugated paper pad <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>), in spite of irregularities and imperfections in the installation of the water distribution mechanism <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Having the rectangular teeth is the preferred embodiment; however, the teeth need not necessarily be rectangular. For example, triangular or semi-circular teeth or protrusions from the drip edge of the bonnet <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> may be operational, but because of the difficulty in creating those patterns along the drip edge of the bonnet <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, they are not preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, there is shown the water distribution mechanism <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> within a housing <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. As indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the housing <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> has an upper rectangular portion <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> adapted to hold the water distribution mechanism <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The housing <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> also has two horizontal members <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> which extend substantially horizontally from upper rectangular portion <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. On the downstream side of the air flow, the housing <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> also comprises a backing member <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. In operation, air flow through the corrugated paper pad <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> tends to push that pad against the backing member <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. On the upstream side of the air flow is a removable member <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. This removable plate member <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is preferably constructed so as to hang on a lip <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> of the structure <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The removable member may be removed to allow removal of the corrugated paper pad <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. Each of the housing <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and removable member <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> are preferably made of <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> stainless steel; however, other materials may be used, e.g. other stainless compositions, or merely galvanized metals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In operation, water from a sump (not shown) is pumped by a pump (not shown) into the spray pipe <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. Because of the holes <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> in the upper portion of the spray bar <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, which holes are preferably 1&frac12;&Prime; apart and having a diameter of {fraction (7/64)}&Prime;, the water sprays out of the top surface or portion of the spray bar <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and strikes an upper portion of the bonnet <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. Some of that water may immediately drip back down onto the spray bar <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and then onto the corrugated paper pad <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. Some of that water may likewise splatter or splash toward the inside diameter of the bonnet <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, which water is then dripped from the lower drip edges of the bonnet <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> onto the corrugated air filter <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. Finally, some of that water may not splash at all and instead merely runs around the inside diameter to drip as previously described. Once the water drips onto the corrugated air filter <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, the force of gravity tends to pull water through the filter. At the same time, air flow preferably moves through the filter at substantially right angles to the direction of water flow through. The air looses heat in the process of changing the water from liquid to a gaseous form. Water that is not evaporated and that runs through the corrugated paper pad <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is collected in a portion of trough section <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, which is also preferably made of stainless steel. The trough <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> preferably comprises two shoulders <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>B upon which a lower portion of the corrugated paper filter <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> rests. The water flow dripping off the lower portion of the corrugated air filter <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> accumulates in the basin portion of the trough and then runs, preferably by force of gravity, through the exit pipe <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> back to the sump (not shown), where the process starts again. Any water lost during the process is preferably added to the sump, for example, by means of a float connected to a valve maintaining a particular level in the sump. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, there is shown a perspective view of the housing <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and the trough section <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. In particular, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows that preferably each trough <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> has a flange <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> on each end. Constructing the lower portion of the evaporative air conditioning system <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> involves bolting a plurality of these troughs <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> together to form a trough assembly of the proper length. In the preferred embodiment, each of these troughs is 10&prime; long. Thus, to make an air washer having a length of 30&prime;, three such troughs would be required. Preferably, a plurality of bolts holds each of the troughs together, and a gasket or O-ring <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> preferably seals the two mating portions. The gasket or O-ring <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> may be made of any suitable material, such as rubber. On the ends of the trough <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> that are not connected to a corresponding trough, a blind flange <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> is used to retain the water within the trough <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. Correspondingly, the upper housing <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is likewise preferably 10&prime; in length, and a plurality of these are placed end-to-end to create the overall upper housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The above discussion is meant to be illustrative of the principles and various embodiments of the present invention. Numerous variations and modifications will become apparent to those skilled in the art once the above disclosure is fully appreciated. For example, the preferred embodiments show the bonnet having semi-circular cross-section; however, the bonnet need not be circular in any form, and could be square tubing, either mounted horizontally or rotated such that one of the 90&deg; angles forms the upper portion of the bonnet. Further, the bonnet could be made of some angle material, for example, angle iron, having additional portions welded thereto to create a baffle as to the water flow to alleviate the splashing. Likewise, with respect to the trough sections, the devices need not be made of stainless steel, and could be formed of plastic materials, such as PVC. Further, the spray bar need not necessarily be a pipe having a circular cross-section, and instead could be any tubular material through which water may be pumped and holes drilled to create the water flow or water streams of the water distribution mechanism. It is intended that the following claims be interpreted to embrace all such variations and modifications. </paragraph>
