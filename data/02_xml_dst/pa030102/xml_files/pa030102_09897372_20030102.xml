<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an exhaust valve assembly and, more particularly, to an exhaust valve assembly for controlling the flow of exhaust gases therethrough. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Important considerations in the design of exhaust systems include the muffling of sound, and engine performance. At lower engine RPM, such as occurs at idle or cruising speed, it typically is desirable to have a higher back pressure in the exhaust system to help muffle the exhaust sound and create a quieter exhaust. At higher RPM, when engine performance is desired, it typically is desirable to have lower back pressure in the exhaust system to obtain higher horsepower engine performance. At higher RPM, though, the increased exhaust flow triggers the exhaust valve to open, which reduces back pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Many efforts have been made in the design of exhaust systems to address these important considerations. One known exhaust valve system that has been relatively successful in the marketplace, for example, uses a hinged flap and a linear torsion spring that connects the flap to the exhaust pipe and extends across the open end of the exhaust tube. The spring exerts a closing force on the flap that increases as the valve opens. A drawback of this and other known systems is that the closing force exerted on the flap increases substantially as the flap opens which tends to increase back pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide an exhaust valve system having a flap that opens once the engine reaches a predetermined RPM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is a further object of the present invention to provide an exhaust valve system that applies a closing force on the flap that increases in magnitude at a non-linear rate as the flap opens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the present invention to provide an exhaust valve system that uses a linear spring to apply a non-linear closing force on the flap. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In accordance with these and other objects, the present invention provides an exhaust valve assembly for controlling the flow of exhaust. The exhaust valve assembly comprises a hollow elongated member, desirably in the form of an exhaust pipe or component thereof, for the flow of gas therethrough. The hollow elongated member has an open end, and the exhaust valve assembly further comprises a flap associated with the open end and a spring having two ends. The flap is pivotable between a first position to close the open end and a second position to open the open end, and is adapted to pivot toward the second position when the exhaust gas within the elongated member achieves a predetermined pressure. One end of the spring is associated with the flap and the other end of the spring is associated with the elongated member along the length of the elongated member. The spring biases the flap toward the first position. The spring desirably extends generally parallel to a longitudinal axis of the elongated member when the flap is in the first position. The flap desirably includes a lateral edge having a hook and the one end of the spring is mounted to the hook. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the exhaust valve assembly further includes a magnet associated with the open end of the elongated member for biasing the flap toward the first position when the pressure of exhaust gas within the elongated member is less than a predetermined level. The magnet desirably prevents rattling of the flap and maintains the flap in a closed position at low exhaust gas pressure. Additionally, the flap may include an enclosing portion and a distal portion and the hollow elongated member may include a flange for engaging the distal portion when the flap is in the first position. The magnet desirably applies the biasing force to the distal portion. The spring may be a coil spring, a bent wire spring or any other type of spring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the flap is hingedly connected to the elongated member in any suitable manner. For example, the elongated member may define a pair of holes to receive a stem that is rigidly mounted to the flap. Additionally, the elongated member desirably is a single piece extrusion.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> illustrate an exhaust valve assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprising a hollow tubular member in the form of an exhaust pipe <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a flap <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and a coil spring <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for controlling the flow of exhaust gas through the exhaust pipe, and a magnet <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The illustrated exhaust pipe <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> includes an open end <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, and the flap <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is hingedly connected to the exhaust pipe by a hinge <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> such that the flap can pivot between a first position to substantially close the open end <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> (see e.g. FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) and a second position to open the open end (see e.g. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). In the illustrated embodiment, the magnet <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is mounted to the exhaust pipe <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> opposite the hinge <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to bias the flap <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> towards the first position at low exhaust gas pressure desirably to prevent rattling of the exhaust pipe or keep the flap completely closed at low exhaust gas pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The exhaust pipe <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may have any suitable construction. In the illustrated embodiment, for example, the exhaust pipe <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is a single-piece metal extrusion and has a leading portion <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> having a generally rectangular cross section, and a tail portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> having a generally circular cross section. The open end <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the exhaust pipe is generally rectangular and includes a flange <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The magnet <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may have any suitable construction and desirably is mounted on a rear side of the flange <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in any suitable manner. The magnet <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may, for example, be in the form of an aluminum-nickel-cobalt magnet sold by Magnetic Component Engineering, Inc. of Torrance, Calif. The magnet <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may, for example, be secured to the exhaust pipe <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by a ceramic adhesive or any other suitable adhesive or may be welded to the exhaust pipe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The flap <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may have any suitable construction that desirably complements the configuration of the open end <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the exhaust pipe <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated embodiment, for example, the flap <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> includes a rectangular enclosing portion <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to close the open end <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and a rectangular distal portion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> that contacts or otherwise engages the flange <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> when the flap <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is in the closed position. The distal portion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> extends outward from the enclosing portion <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> at a slight angle relative to the enclosing portion to complement the configuration of the flange <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The flap <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be secured to the exhaust pipe <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in any suitable manner. In the illustrated embodiment, for example, the flap <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is hingedly secured to the exhaust pipe <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> adjacent the open end <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the exhaust pipe. In this embodiment, the hinge <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> includes a stem <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> rigidly mounted to or otherwise associated with the flange, and a pair of holes <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> defined by the exhaust pipe <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to permit pivoting of the flap <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> relative to the exhaust pipe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The spring <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be secured to the flap <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the exhaust pipe <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in any suitable manner. In the illustrated embodiment, for example, the spring <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is mounted to a pair of hooks <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. The hook <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is formed on the lateral edge of the flap <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the hook <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is formed along the length of the exhaust pipe <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The spring <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be secured to the exhaust pipe <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and to the flap <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in any other suitable manner in accordance with alternative embodiments of the invention. For example, one or both of the ends of the spring <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be welded thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The spring <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> desirably extends substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the exhaust pipe <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> when the flap <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is in the first position, and biases the flap to the first position. Because of the orientation of the spring <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the biasing force is non-linear. In the illustrated embodiment, as the flap <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> opens, the biasing force desirably increases at a decreasing rate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, due to the biasing force of the spring <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the flap <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the exhaust valve in accordance with a preferred embodiment stays in the first position when the pressure of the exhaust gas is low. When the pressure reaches a predetermined pressure, which desirably occurs when the engine reaches a predetermined RPM, the flap <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> begins to pivot towards the second position. Once the flap <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> begins to open, the biasing force applied by the spring <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> desirably increases at a decreasing rate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Preferably, at low exhaust pressure, when the flap <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is in the first position, the open end <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is substantially closed. The magnet <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> desirably prevents rattling of the flap <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and also closes any opening that otherwise may exist if the flap were instead hanging freely in the first position. The magnitude of the biasing force of the magnet <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, however, may be relatively insignificant as compared to the biasing force of the spring <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in that once the flap <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> opens due to the increased exhaust pressure, the biasing force of the magnet has little or no effect on the pivoting of the flap until the flap returns to the first or substantially closed position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Additionally, if desired, the exhaust pipe <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can include any suitable structure for centering the flap <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> between opposed side walls <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of the exhaust pipe when the flap is in the closed position. For example, the exhaust pipe <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may define a cavity (not shown) for receiving the lateral edges of the flap <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to guide the flap to a center position. If desired, the cavity may, for instance, be defined by a pair of indentations or ribs (not shown) on the inner sides of opposed walls <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. Desirably, such ribs or indentations are adjacent to hinge <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and extend only a portion of the length of the opposed walls <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> If desired, the hinge <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may further include a pair of wire mesh bushings (not shown) received within holes <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> for engaging the stem <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and the exhaust pipe <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The wire mesh bushings may be used, for example, to accommodate the expansion of the exhaust pipe <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at elevated temperatures and reduce binding of the stem <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> within the holes <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. The wire mesh bushings may, for example, be constructed of 304 SS (stainless steel) wire spun to about 50% density. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In accordance with alternative embodiments, the spring <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may have any other suitable construction that desirably applies a non-linear biasing force on the flap. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, for example, illustrates a spring in the form of a bent wire spring <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Although the invention has been described and illustrated in detail with reference to preferred embodiments, it is to be clearly understood that the same is by way of illustration and example only, and is not to be taken by way of limitation.
