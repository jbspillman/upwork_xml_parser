<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to an occupant sensor apparatus for use in a vehicle occupant protection system or the like, and is particularly directed to an occupant sensor apparatus that maps distance to an occupant over a scanned area to determine an occupant characteristic. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Occupant protection systems for use in vehicles are known in the art. One type of protection system includes an actuatable inflatable protection module, which has an inflatable component that is commonly referred to as an air bag. A controller determines whether the protection module is to be actuated to inflate the air bag within a vehicle passenger compartment. The protection module is actuated by the controller upon the occurrence of a predetermined vehicle condition for which a vehicle occupant is to be protected. For example, when a sensor senses a vehicle condition indicative of a deployment collision condition, the protection module is actuated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In certain circumstances, even if the predetermined deployment condition occurs, the protection system refrains from actuating the protection module (i.e., the air bag is not inflated). For example, if an occupant seated in a vehicle seat associated with the restraint module is located in a position such that actuating the protection module and deploying the air bag will not enhance protection of the occupant, actuation of the protection module does not occur. An occupant who is very near the protection module is referred to as being within an occupant out-of-position zone. Deploying an air bag for an occupant who is within an occupant out-of-position zone will not enhance protection of the occupant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In another example, it is typically not desirable to actuate a protection module (i.e., inflate an air bag) when an occupant associated with the location of the restraint module is a child in a child seat. This is typically due to the fact that actuation of the restraint module will not enhance protection for the child. In yet another example, it is typically not desirable to actuate a protection module when an occupant does not occupy the seat associated with the protection module. An actuated protection module typically requires costly servicing/replacement. Thus, actuation of a protection module when an occupant is absent is economically wasteful. In sum, controlling actuation (e.g., abstaining from deployment) based upon one or more occupant characteristics provides certain benefits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A protection module may have one or more adjustable aspects, and in order to enhance performance of the protection module, the adjustable aspect(s) are adjusted. In the example protection module that contains a deployable air bag, a deployment dynamic profile of the air bag is adjustable. Specifically, the inflation timing, inflation pressure, the rate of inflation, and the positioning of the inflated air bag are all potential adjustable aspects. The adjustment of the protection module is responsive one or more occupant characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Occupant characteristics are determined via sensory operations. Accordingly, sensory information regarding the occupant plays an important role in the control of protection devices. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF AN EXAMPLE EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> An occupant protection system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is schematically illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is provided for an occupant <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> seated on a vehicle seat <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> within a vehicle <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes an actuatable occupant protection device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that is provided as a module. The protection module <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is associated with the vehicle seat <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and thus an occupant seating location provided by the seat. In one example embodiment, the protection module <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes an inflatable component, commonly referred to as an air bag. The air bag is inflatable within an occupant compartment of the vehicle. In the illustrated example, the protection module <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is located within a dashboard or instrument panel <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the vehicle <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the vehicle seat <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is a front passenger seat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> It is to be appreciated that the specific type and the location of protection device are not limitations on the present invention. In other words, features of the protection device may be changed without departing from the present invention. For example, another type of protection device (e.g., a driver side protection module or a side curtain module) may be provided in the system and/or the protection device may be located elsewhere within the vehicle (e.g., on the steering wheel). The system may include a protection device that does not have an inflatable component, such as an actuatable knee bolster or a seat belt system with an actuatable portion (e.g., a pretensioner). Also, it will be appreciated that the system may include a plurality of actuatable protection devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In one example, the protection module <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may also have at least one adjustable aspect. For example, the deployment of the air bag is adjusted. Examples of an air bag deployment adjustment includes adjustment of inflation timing, adjustment of inflation pressure, adjustment of location of the inflated air bag relative to the occupant, and adjustment of the dynamic profile of the air bag during inflation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> A specific example of adjustment to inflation timing is selection of a time period between a determination to actuate the protection module and an initiation of the air bag inflation. A specific example of adjustment of inflation pressure is control of a pressure relief valve that vents the air bag. Dynamic profile control is accomplished by directing inflation fluid into the air bag in predetermined zones within the air bag or by control of the number and timing of a plurality of inflation sources and vent valves during inflation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> A specific example of adjustment of air bag positioning is control of positioning motors operative to move the air bag housing. Another specific example of adjustment of air bag positioning is moving the entire protection module toward or away from the occupant and/or moving the occupant toward or away from the protection module. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Control of the protection module <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, to adjust any adjustable aspect(s) and to cause actuation of the protection module is by a controller <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> that is operatively connected <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to provide control signals to the protection module. In one example, the controller <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is a microcomputer. The controller <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> receives sensory input from several sources and, using the sensory input, makes determinations regarding protection module control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> One of the sensory input sources for the controller <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is a sensor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> that senses a vehicle condition for which an occupant is to be protected, and that is operatively connected <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to provide a signal to the controller indicative of the sensed vehicle condition. In one example, which is illustrated in the Figures, the sensor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is a crash sensor that senses a condition that is indicative of a vehicle crash. Preferably, the crash sensor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is an accelerometer, and the signal is an electric signal that has a voltage value indicative of the sensed acceleration and/or a frequency value indicative of the sensed acceleration. In another example, the sensor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> senses a condition indicative of a vehicle rollover. It should be appreciated by a person of ordinary skill in the art that the system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> could have a plurality of sensors providing signals to the controller <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> that are indicative of vehicle conditions for which the occupant is to be protected. Hereinafter, only the single crash sensor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and its crash indicative signal are discussed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> An occupant sensor apparatus <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> in accordance with the present invention provides another sensory input for the controller <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated example, at least some a portion of the sensor apparatus <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is mounted in the instrument panel <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> near the protection module <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. However, it will be appreciated upon further reading it will be understood that other locations for the sensor apparatus <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The sensor apparatus <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> includes an electromagnetic (EM) energy driver component <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> that is operatively connected <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to the controller <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. An EM energy source <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is operatively connected <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to the driver component <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and is driven by the driver component to emit an EM energy beam <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. In one example, the emitted beam <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is a light beam, and in particular the light beam is in the infrared portion of the energy spectrum and has a relatively narrow cross-section area. Further in the example, the energy source <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is an infrared light emitting diode (LED), and the driver component <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is an LED driver component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The LED driver component <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> drives the LED <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to output its infrared light beam <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> at a modulation. In one example, the modulation of the light beam <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is at a frequency at or near 3 MHz. However, it is to be appreciated that other modulation frequencies are possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The LED <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is positioned to direct its output beam <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> at a movable reflection component <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The movable reflection component <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is operatively connected <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> to a movement driver component <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> that causes and controls movement of the reflection component <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. In turn, the movement driver component <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is operatively connected <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to the controller <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In one example, the reflection component <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> includes a movable reflecting surface that is provided within a MEM (microelectronic machine). A MEM is also known as a micro-machined component and is of a relatively small size (e.g., constructed on the order of a semiconductor technology device). Hereinafter, the reflection component <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is referred to as a MEM device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates one example of the MEM device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> includes an outer frame <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> that is mounted to be motionless relative to the major components of the vehicle (e.g., the vehicle chassis) and associated fixedly mounted components (e.g., the instrument panel <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>). The outer frame <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may have any shape. In the illustrated example, the outer frame <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> has a rectangular shape. The outer frame <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> bounds an area <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> within its extent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Located within the area <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> bounded by the outer frame <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is an inner frame <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> that can be thought of as a floating frame. The inner frame <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> can have any shape, and in the illustrated example it has a rectangular shape. Although not essential, the shape of the inner frame <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> mimics the shape of the outer frame <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The inner frame <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> bounds an area <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> A pair of connector segments <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> connects the inner frame <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> to the outer frame <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated example, the connector segments <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> extend coaxially along an X-axis. The connector segments <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> are flexible to permit the inner frame <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> to pivot slightly about the X-axis relative to the outer frame <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The connector segments <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> are resilient and provide a returning force that urges the inner frame <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> toward a neutral position in which the connector segments <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> are not flexed and the outer and inner frames <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> are generally coplanar. Thus, the connector segments <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> functions similar to torsion springs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> A reflective surface portion <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> has the reflecting surface (e.g., a mirror surface) located thereon to reflect the beam <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The reflective surface portion <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is located within the area <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> bounded by the inner frame <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and thus within the area <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> bounded by the outer frame <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The reflective surface portion <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> may have any shape. In the illustrated example, reflective surface portion <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> has a rectangular shape. Although not essential, the shape of the reflective surface portion <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is related to the shape of the inner frame <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> A pair of connector segments <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> connects the reflective surface portion <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to the inner frame <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated example, the connector segments <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> extend coaxially and extend perpendicular to the-extent of the connector segments <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> between the outer and inner frames <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. Thus, in the illustrated example, the connector segments <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> between the inner frame <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and the reflective surface portion <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> extend along a Y-axis. The connector segments <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> are flexible to permit the reflective surface portion <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to pivot slightly about the Y-axis relative to the inner frame <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The connector segments <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> are resilient and provide a returning force that urges the reflective surface portion <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> toward a neutral position in which the connector segments are not flexed, and the inner frame <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and the reflective surface portion <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> are generally coplanar. Thus, the connector segments <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> functions similar to torsion springs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The connector segments <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> are generally inflexible about the X-axis. Thus, the reflective surface portion <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is constrained to pivot with the inner frame <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> about the X-axis. In other words, when the inner frame <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> pivots about the X-axis, the reflective surface portion <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> also moves in a pivot motion about the X-axis. In sum, the reflective surface portion <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is movable in two (X and Y) pivot directions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The inner frame <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and the reflective surface portion <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> have materials that are responsive to electromagnetic stimulation. Electromagnetic stimulation force is used to pivot (move) the inner frame <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and the reflective surface portion <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In order to provide the electromagnetic force to cause pivoting movement of the reflective surface portion <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> about the Y-axis, an electrostatic force component <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is mounted adjacent to a segment of the reflective surface portion <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> at a location spaced away from the connector segments <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. A Y-drive portion <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> of the movement driver component <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> energizes the electrostatic force component <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> to attract or repel the adjacent material of the reflective surface portion <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In order to provide the electromagnetic force to cause pivoting movement of the inner frame/reflective surface portion <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> about the X-axis, an electrostatic force component <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is mounted adjacent to a segment of the inner frame <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> at a location spaced away from the connector segments <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. An X-drive portion <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of the movement driver component <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> energizes the electrostatic force component <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> to attract or repel the adjacent material of the inner frame/reflective surface portion <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The pivoting movement of the reflective surface portion <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> on the Y-axis is a back and forth, relatively fast oscillation motion, and the pivoting movement of the inner frame/reflective surface portion <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> on the X-axis is a back and forth, relatively fast oscillation motion. As such each of the pivoting movements can be considered as vibrations. In one example, oscillation about the Y-axis is at or near 3,000 Hz and oscillation about the X-axis is at or near 30 Hz. However, it is to be appreciated that other oscillation frequencies are possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Returning to the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the beam <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> that is emitted from the LED <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, impinges upon the MEM device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, and is directed away (designated <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>&prime;) from the instrument panel <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> toward the occupant location. The path of the beam <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>&prime; away from the MEM device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is dependent upon the current condition in the MEM device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> (e.g., the current orientation or position of the reflective surface portion <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) caused by the movement driver component <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). Further, the path of the beam <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>&prime; changes as the condition of the MEM device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> (orientation or position of the reflective surface portion <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) changes. The beam <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>&prime; is &ldquo;pointed&rdquo; or directed at any of a plurality of locations or points within a space area (e.g., two-dimensional) <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> located at a distance from the instrument panel <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Further, the change in the MEM device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> (movement of the reflective surface portion <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) is such that the beam is scanned across the area <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. Hereinafter, the area <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is referred to as the scanned area <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The scanned area <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is at the occupant seating location. If an occupant/object (e.g., occupant <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) is present on the vehicle seat <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the scanned area <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> includes at least a portion of the occupant. If the vehicle seat <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is empty, the scanned area <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> includes at least a portion of a seat back <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. In short, for each scan point, the beam <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>&prime; continues until the beam reaches a surface (e.g., a surface of the occupant <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or the seat back <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The beam <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>&prime; is reflected from the surface upon which the beam impinges. Specifically, an amount (designated <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>&Prime;) of the beam <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>&prime; is reflected back toward the instrument panel <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. It is to be appreciated that the reflection of beam energy <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>&Prime; need not be a perfect reflection but could merely be a scattering back toward the instrument panel <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The reflected beam energy <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>&Prime; still conveys the modulation. Again, it is to be appreciated that the reflection may be from a surface of the occupant <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), a surface of the vehicle seat <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, or from some other surface (e.g., a portion of a child seat that is still considered to be a vehicle occupant to be sensed). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The reflected beam energy <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>&Prime;, or at least the reflected beam energy, is detected by an EM energy receiving device <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. In particular, the EM energy receiving device <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is a photodetector <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. Further, because the illustrated example deals with infrared energy, the photodetector <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is an infrared photodetector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated example, the photodetector <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is mounted in the instrument panel <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, adjacent to the MEM device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and protection module <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. It is to be appreciated that the photodetector <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> may be mounted at some other location, as will be appreciated after further reading. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The photodetector <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is operatively connected <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> to a phase determination component <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>. The LED driver component <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and/or the LED <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are also operatively connected <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> to the phase determination component <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>. The phase determination component <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> operates to detect a phase between the emitted beam <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and detected beam energy <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>&Prime;. Specifically, phase is born out by difference in the modulation of the emitted and received energy. The determined phase is indicative of the distance between the instrument panel <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, with the sensor apparatus <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and the surface (e.g., a surface of the occupant <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) from which the beam <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>&prime; is reflected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> At this point it is to be appreciated that the MEM device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and the photodetector <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> may be mounted at a different location of the vehicle. The distance indication would merely be for a distance between the location of the MEM device photodetector <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and the surface from which reflection occurs. For example, if the protection device is a side curtain, locating the MEM device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and photodetector <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> to the side of the occupant location would provide useful distance information about lateral location of the occupant, etc. Still further, it is to be appreciated that the MEM device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and the photodetector <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> may be spaced at a significant distance from each other. Distance indications are obtained, but simple geometric relationships must be factored into the distance indications. Also, factoring geometric relationships may be needed to relate determined distance indications to another point within the vehicle (e.g., a location of a protection device). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The phase determination component <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> operates at a sensor sample rate such that samples are taken and phase differences are determined as the MEM device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> scans the beam <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>&prime; across the scanned area <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> at the occupant location. In one example, the sampling occurs at a rate of 3,000 samples per second. Accordingly, in the discussed example, this would result in a 100&times;100 pixel array of samples taken for each vertical frame scanned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The phase determination component <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> is operatively connected <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to the controller <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the determined phase information is provided from the phase determination component to the controller. The controller <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> utilizes the phase information to make determinations about distance and occupant characteristics indicated by the distances. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Within the controller <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the plurality of determined distances that comprise the pixel array (e.g., 100&times;100) and position (e.g., targeting) information from the movement driver component <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are used to provide a contour map of the scanned area <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. In other words, the distances, and differences between distances, indicate the surface curvature, etc. of the surface from which the beam energy <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>&Prime; is reflected. From the contour map, determinations about occupant presence, occupant type (e.g., animate person/inanimate object, large/small, adult/child), occupant location (e.g., leaning, tilted), etc. are made. The determinations may be made by any suitable technique, such as recognition and interpretation techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The controller <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> uses the determined information (e.g., distance, occupant characteristics, etc.) to make determinations with regard to control of the protection module <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. This control is in conjunction with control determinations based upon inputs provided by the crash sensor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> provides an example illustration of a block diagram that represents the processing that occurs within the controller <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. It is to be appreciated that the blocks shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> represent one or more circuits and/or processors performing algorithms that accomplish the discussed functions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The input from the crash sensor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is provided to a crash determination processing component <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Within the crash determination processing component <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, the sensory information is processed and a determination is made as to whether a vehicle crash condition is occurring. The determination with regard to the occurrence of a vehicle crash condition is provided to a protection module control processing component <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Inputs from the movement driver and the phase determination components <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> are provided to a dynamic memory <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. Within the memory <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, mated pairs of mirror target location and distance indicative information are stored in an M&times;N matrix. The memory <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is dynamic in that the memory information is constantly being rewritten as the mirror is continuously scanned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The information that is stored in the memory <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> may have any suitable form. For example, the stored information may be based upon determined intensity that is indicative of phase difference and thus indicative of distance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> An &ldquo;image&rdquo; processing component <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> receives the target location and distance indicative information from the memory <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. It should be recalled that the information is provided in matrix form and that the matrix is related to a scanned area. Thus, an &ldquo;image&rdquo; is generated based upon the distance indications for the pixel points that comprise the scanned area. However, it is to be appreciated that the processing that is done is not intended to be a limitation on the present invention. Mere distance determination is a basic form of processing. Still further, more sophisticated processing such as edge detection determination may be done. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> An occupant characteristic processing component <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> utilizes the results of the imaging processing to make determinations about one or more occupant characteristics. For example, the determinations may be directed to whether an occupant is present, where the occupant is located, and the type of occupant (e.g., an adult or a child in a child seat). The results of the occupant characteristic processing are provided to the protection module control processing component <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and utilized therein to control the protection module. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> From the above description of the invention, those skilled in the art will perceive improvements, changes and modifications. Such improvements, changes and modifications within the skill of the art are intended to be covered by the appended claims. </paragraph>
