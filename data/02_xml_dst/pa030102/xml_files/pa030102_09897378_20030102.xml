<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a device for supporting paint utensils used during painting, and more particularly relates to a utensil holder that is releasably secured to a paint tray for supporting a paint roller, paintbrush, paint wheel or the like when not in use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> During the painting process, the need often arises to alternate utensils, such as, paint rollers or paintbrushes in order to appropriately paint a specified area. Considering that these tools will be alternated a number of times throughout the painting process, a convenient resting location for the utensil that is not in use is very desirable. While a utensil holder may provide a resting location, preferably, the holder is either permanently secured to a paint tray or can be easily releasably secured to the paint tray. It is desirable for the utensil holder to be positioned as to allow excess paint from the utensil not in use, to drain into the paint reservoir of the paint tray. In addition, the location for the utensil holder must allow access to the paint reservoir for the utensil that is in use. Furthermore, it is also desirable for the utensil holder to position the resting utensil in a convenient orientation to minimize wasted time and motion while alternating utensils. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Several inventions have been disclosed in U.S. Patents that have attempted to address the problems associated with holding paint utensils, however, they do not provide solutions that incorporate many of the desirable features. For instance U.S. Pat. No. 4,890,353 to Shannon, et al., entitled, &ldquo;Paint Brush and Paint Roller Holder&rdquo;, discloses a paint brush holder that is cumbersomely bolted to the end wall of a paint tray. While the holder can support a paintbrush, if it is of a length longer than the spaced apart support members, the handle of the paint brush can only rest in one possible orientation (parallel to the end wall of the paint tray). A paint roller placed in the support members will only allow the handle to be positioned outside of the paint tray in an awkward position. Consequently, any paint that may accumulate on the paint roller handle will not be contained or drain within the paint tray. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Another invention in U.S. Pat. No. 5,509,169 to Drucker, entitled, &ldquo;Paint Tray with Paint Brush Holder&rdquo;, discloses a paint tray that has protrusions or cut outs within the side and end walls which allows a paintbrush to be positioned at an angle supported by the tray walls. While this type of support will hold a paintbrush, the support does not allow excess paint to drain into the paint tray. In addition, a paint roller supported in this manner will have the handle oriented outside the paint tray, with any excess paint draining outside the paint tray. </paragraph>
