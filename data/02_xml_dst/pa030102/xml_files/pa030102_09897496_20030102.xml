<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an apparatus and method for detecting a printhead alignment of a printer. More particularly, the present invention relates to an apparatus and method for detecting a printhead alignment of a printer using an optical sensor having a single point focusing element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In the media printing environment it is important to assure that a printing onto a media is performed accurately. For example, in an inkjet printer environment, if the inkjet printhead is out of alignment, the ink will not print on a media in the proper position. To verify the alignment of a printing apparatus, typically an alignment detector is utilized to review predetermined marks made on a media to determine whether the printing apparatus that printed such marks is in alignment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The alignment detector typically includes at least three components, a light source, an alignment sensor, and a housing to hold both the light source and the sensor, though the housing is not necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference> illustrate examples of alignment sensors. FIG <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A illustrates an alignment sensor that focuses light radiating off of surface <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> from area <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, using lens <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, onto a point position on photodetector <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. When detecting a predetermined mark on a printed media, the alignment detector is usually transported past the predetermined mark, and a deviation in a detected signal is used as the indication of a predetermined mark. However, in the arrangement of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A, because area <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is quite large, the detection of the predetermined mark becomes difficult, as typically the predetermined mark is much smaller than area <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Further, in such a configuration when the predetermined mark is significantly smaller than area <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> there is a greater opportunity for noise to be introduced into the detection operation. In addition, the alignment sensor of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> usually can only detect a relative intensity of a source reflected off media <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Such that when the predetermined marks are printed to form many blocks of parallel lines, e.g., a density pattern, for each different alignment pattern of the printer, the alignment sensor can only measure the relative light intensity reflected off media <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, rather than individual alignment mark intensities. Either of the darkest or lightest appearing predetermined marks may be used to align the printer. Thus, this alignment sensor may not take into account the variations in the media and can be less accurate than a point detection method, as illustrate in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference> illustrates an alignment sensor that focuses light radiating off surface <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, at point <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, using lenses <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, onto a point position of photodetector <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. In this configuration, the detection of the predetermined mark is more accurate, as point <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is usually quite small. However, such an arrangement also has its drawbacks. To perform the point detection at point <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, the alignment sensor of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference> requires an additional lens <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The alignment sensor of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference> may also include a filter to block out interfering light sources. Alternate alignment sensor systems may perform such point detection using even more lenses, rather than just lenses <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. When manufacturing multiple printing apparatuses, or any apparatus which have need of such an alignment sensor, the extra focusing elements excessively drive up costs of the alignment detector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In an alignment detector configuration, the source may be a 640 nm red Light Emitting Diode (LED). Black and cyan inks absorb light at this wavelength and therefore may be detected when compared to the media background. The source LED wavelength can be changed if other ink colors require detection. For example, magenta ink will absorb light from 520-545 nm. A blue LED or white light source will allow all the ink colors to be detected. Typically, the color to mono inkjet cartridges require alignment as well as bi-directional printing from each printhead. Such alignments include mono bi-directional print for normal and draft modes, color bi-directional print for normal and draft modes, and mono to color horizontal and vertical alignment as well as skew alignment for mono printheads. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</cross-reference> illustrate examples of horizontal alignment. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> illustrates the situation where a predetermined mark is out of alignment, while the predetermined mark is in alignment in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>. The miss-alignment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> is evidence of the nozzles in a printhead being miss-aligned. As inkjet nozzle heights continue to increase, skew becomes an important measurement. Skew is the measure of how well the printhead is aligned vertically with the media. For example, a vertical line is printed in a fill head height of the printhead and a second vertical line is printed in the same horizontal location but below the first line, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</cross-reference>. The measure of skew is how well the top of the second line aligns with the bottom of the first line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Previous implementations of printer alignment have been illustrated in Hubbard et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,907,013, which illustrates a circuitry design for detecting a malfunction of an inkjet printhead, Lindenfelser et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,534,895, which illustrates a method and apparatus for adjusting the quality of a printing, Matsuda, U.S. Pat. No. 6,084,607, which illustrates an inkjet printer detecting test patterns and detecting a deviation in the relative positioning of printheads, and in Beauchamp et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,448,269, and Beauchamp et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,975,674, both setting forth inkjet printhead alignment. However, none of these references sufficiently solve the aforementioned problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Thus, the present invention overcomes the problems associated with previous alignment detectors, including the inability of accurately detect predetermined printed marks on a media and performing such detection with a minimum number of elements. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to like elements throughout. In accordance with the preferred embodiments, there is provided a method and apparatus for optical alignment point detecting a predetermined mark on a media using a single focusing element and an improved photodetector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates an embodiment of the present invention including an alignment sensor having a photodetector <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and a single focusing element <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference>, previous alignment sensors included at least one convex lens <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> for focusing light radiating off of media <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. However, to perform point detection an additional lens <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> was needed, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates a point detection enabled alignment sensor where focusing element <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is also a convex lens, but has been modified to both focus light from a point on media <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> and focus that light to a point on photodetector <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Focusing element <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is a single focusing element because there is only one focusing operation being performed, i.e., by surface <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> of focusing element <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. Additional lenses are not necessary, as all that is required is that point focusing be performed by focusing element <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. In an embodiment of the present invention, focusing element <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> images an object 3 mm in front of it onto photodetector <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, which is placed 3 mm behind focusing element <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, though the focal length of focusing element <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> can be adjusted in alternative embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment of the present invention, both photodetector <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and focusing element <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> may be encapsulated in a material, such as a translucent polymer, though not limited thereto. Alternatively, the area between focusing element <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and photodetector <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> could be filled with the same material without fully encapsulating both elements. In addition, when photodetector <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and focusing element <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> are encapsulated in the material, or include the material in the area separating the two, with focusing element <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> being made of the same material, there would not be any refraction effects from light exiting focusing element <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and radiating onto photodetector <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, when photodetector <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and focusing element <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> are separated, by air for example when the area between focusing element <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and photodetector <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is not completely filled with the aforementioned material, the design of focusing element <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> has to be modified to compensate for these refracting effects, as well as the refracting effect of any air between photodetector <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and focusing element <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Thus, embodiments of the present invention include an alignment sensor that has a minimum number of focusing elements, while still producing a point detection. Further, as an embodiment includes focusing element <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and photodetector <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> being encapsulated in a material, with focusing element <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> being made of the same material, focusing element <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> does not have to compensate for refraction of light, and the alignment sensor can be made into a single unit easily mass produced at a low cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In addition to focusing element <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> being a single focusing element, alignment sensor resolution may be further enhanced by placing an aperture on photodetector <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. In an embodiment of the present invention, the aperture shape is a 5 mil slit along the entire die length of photodetector <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and may be arranged to be parallel to the predetermined marks on the media that are in a vertical orientation, for example. The point focusing being performed by focusing element <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> would include point focusing onto an area including the aperture shape formed on photodetector <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</cross-reference> illustrate a die <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> of photodetector <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> showing a side view and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> showing a top view. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A, die <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> is coated with a mask layer <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, which may be made of a metal for example, with a groove being formed in mask layer <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> to generate aperture <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. In an alternative embodiment, aperture <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> may include a crossing groove, slanted grooves, a circular shaped cavity, or any other form that may correspond to the type of predetermined mark printed on the media, photodetector <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is designed to detect. For example, if the predetermined mark has been printed by a vertical row of inkjet nozzles, then the vertical groove formed by mask layer <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> would allow for a detection of any miss-alignment in those vertical nozzles. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> shows a top view of photodetector <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, with an object image <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> being imaged onto aperture <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, as well as being blocked by mask layer <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, and detected by photodetector <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> connected to transistor <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> and placed atop die <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates an embodiment of the present alignment detector, including light source <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and alignment sensor <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> in a housing <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, when light source <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> irradiates media <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight>, alignment sensor <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> detects a predetermined mark at point <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight>. Although <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates alignment sensor <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> partially protruding from housing <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>, this is not necessary, as alignment sensor <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> could be further embedded into housing <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>, whereby housing <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> would become a type of aperture blocking some light from entering alignment sensor. In the embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, alignment sensor <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> does not include an external aperture blocking incoming light, as it focuses all light radiating to a focusing element of alignment sensor <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> to a photodetector therein. In addition, traditionally in light detectors the light sensors may be embedded into a housing or placed at the end of light tubes or cavities within the housing, forming an aperture. This typical arrangement provides for a mechanism to absorb unwanted light, by the sides of the housing or light tube, and guide the remaining light to the light sensor. However, in alignment sensor <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> of the present embodiment of the invention, all light radiating to the focusing element is point focused to a photodetector, i.e., converging the incoming light to a point on the photodetector and thereby preventing a majority of the light from escaping from the focusing operation and improperly influencing an alignment detection. Thus, as there is no need of having an absorbing material, such as the sides of a housing or light tube, alignment sensor <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> would not need such light tubes or cavities in the housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Further, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> also shows that light source <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and alignment sensor <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> may be easily connected to a controller of a printing apparatus, for example, by lead contacts <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>, for light source <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, and lead contacts <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight>, for alignment sensor <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. The controller may control the movement of the alignment detector, or the movement of the media in relation thereto. The controller may also determine from the detection of the predetermined mark, or from a plurality of marks, whether the printing apparatus is in alignment, e.g., if the printheads of a printing apparatus are in alignment. Though, the detection of the predetermined marks may also be used by the controller to also determine whether other parts of the printing apparatus are out of alignment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> large area of media <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> is illuminated with light source <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, which may be any light source enabling detection of ink printed on media <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight>. The large area illumination, in this embodiment, insures that any misalignments of alignment sensor, in housing <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>, or made during manufacturing thereof, will be compensated for. Preferably, the distance between the focusing element of alignment sensor <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and point <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> on media <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> should be the same distance as the focal distance between the focusing element and photodetector within alignment sensor <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, though the focusing element may be modified to account for any deviances from such an arrangement by altering the shape of the focusing element. In addition, an aperture and the focal length of alignment sensor <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> may be modified to allow for either larger or smaller object detection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As noted above, when a media is being transported beneath housing <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>, or as housing <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> is being transported across the media, predetermined marks printed on media <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> can be accurately detected by their detected reflections off of media <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Alignment sensor <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> may be operated in digital mode by the aforementioned controller, and can be connected electrically to a Schmitt trigger, for example, or the Schmitt trigger may be integrated onto die <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>. Typically, when the housing is transported across media <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> at a constant velocity, the predetermined marks printed on media <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> will cause a state change on the output of alignment sensor <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. In addition, these changes in output can be analyzed to determine the relative time or distance between the predetermined marks. For example, if housing <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> is being transported at 5 inches/second and the sample frequency of alignment sensor <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> output is 5 khz, then every sample is spaced by {fraction (1/1000)} of an inch. Alignment sensor <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> may also be operated in analog mode by the aforementioned controller, where the magnitude of the predetermined marks printed on media <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> can be determined based on how much light is returned to alignment sensor <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. This is useful when the predetermined marks are small. Small changes between predetermined marks can be measured using data corresponding to the amplitude and width of detected predetermined marks, which is also useful in determining a relative darkness or lightness of the predetermined marks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Further, although the alignment detector according to embodiments of the present invention has only been described in a printing environment having a transport unit to move a media and/or move the housing supporting the alignment detector, it would be equally applicable in any environment which would benefit from point detection using a minimal number of sensor elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Thus, although a few preferred embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it would be appreciated by those skilled in the art that changes may be made in these embodiments without departing from the principles and spirit of the invention, the scope of which is defined in the claims and their embodiments. </paragraph>
