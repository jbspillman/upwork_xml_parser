<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A motor grader can be adapted for laying down a layer of granular material such as base rock or cold mix asphalt by mounting a dispensing hopper attachment onto the front of the motor grader and a spreading and leveling screed onto the moldboard. As the motor grader advances, it pushes a dump truck that continuously loads materials into the hopper. Those materials are in turn continuously discharged at a metered rate of flow through the bottom of the hopper and onto the roadbed. The resulting swath of materials passes between the front wheels of the grader as the grader continues to advance, whereupon the screed engages the swath and spreads the materials in opposite lateral directions while leveling them to the desired depth. The screed has swept-back wings that may be extended as necessary to adjust the overall width of the screed, and outboard shields on the outermost ends of the wings confine the spread materials to the roadbed and prevent their accidental discharge into ditches and the like alongside the roadbed. The crown of the deposited layer can be varied by tipping the nose of the screed upwardly or downwardly to the extent necessary or desired. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to the field of motor graders and, more particularly, to an attachment that adapts such machines for laying down, in one pass, a finished layer of aggregate material such as base rock or cold mix asphalt onto roads, streets, parking lots or driveways. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The known method of laying down base rock or cold mix asphalt involves a two-step operation in which the material is first dumped from a truck onto the ground or roadbed. A motor grader then comes along and spreads the material back and forth using its moldboard until the material is at the desired depth, width and slope. Typically, excess material slips into ditches on either side of the roadbed and is wasted. Significant, time-consuming working and reworking of the material may be necessary in order to achieve the desired depth, width and crown of the roadbed, which not only slows the overall process but also increases the likelihood of wasting significant amounts of material. Moreover, excessive handling and manipulation of base rock material can result in the limestone fines becoming separated from the aggregate and settling to the bottom of the layer, detracting from their ability to solidify when wet and hold the aggregate in a solid matrix that provides a better roadbed. Generally speaking, the less handling the better when laying down gravel material. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention converts a motor grader into a machine that is capable of laying down in one pass a finished layer of aggregate material such as base rock or asphalt that has the desired thickness, width and profile of the finished product. By laying down the finished product on-the-go in a one-pass operation, significant time and labor savings can be achieved, as well as better control. Furthermore, less handling means a better quality roadbed where base rock is the material being deposited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The present invention contemplates attaching a special distribution hopper to the front end of the motor grader ahead of the front wheels and a special screed to the moldboard behind the front wheels. As the motor grader advances, the hopper continuously receives material from a dump truck being pushed along the roadbed ahead of the grader by the hopper, and such material is continuously metered out onto the roadbed or other surface to form a swath located between the front wheels. The discharged swath of materials is then acted upon by the trailing screed, which skims off excess material from the top of the swath and spreads it laterally outwardly in opposite directions to produce a layer that is wider than the front wheels. Outermost shields at opposite left and right ends of the screed limit the width of the outwardly spreading materials to prevent spillage into ditches alongside the roadbed. The screed is mounted on the front side of the moldboard so as to be in a position to engage and work the materials instead of the moldboard. However, since the moldboard is adjustable in a variety of directions through various hydraulic actuators on the grader, manipulation and adjustment of the moldboard by the actuators can be used to correspondingly adjust the screed. Because the screed is pointed with a pair of diverging wings, adjustment of the nose of the screed upwardly or downwardly relative to the rear ends of the wings results in changes in the shape of the crown that is on the layer of materials being deposited and spread. In one preferred embodiment of the invention, such crown can range from a six inch negative crown to a flat or level crown and to a six inch positive crown at the other extreme. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The two wings of the screed can be extended and retracted hydraulically from the seat of the motor grader so as to correspondingly adjust the width of the material being laid down. The discharge outlet at the bottom of the distribution hopper has of a pair of side-by-side metering gates that can be independently adjusted so as to correspondingly vary the rate of discharge from the hopper. An operator&apos;s platform is provided on the backside of the distribution hopper to enable an extra worker to ride the machine at that location and operate controls for the metering gates as he observes loading and discharging of the hopper. A rotary agitator inside the hopper helps assure an orderly and even discharge flow from the hopper.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The present invention is susceptible of embodiment in many different forms. While the drawings illustrate and the specification describes certain preferred embodiments of the invention, it is to be understood that such disclosure is by way of example only. There is no intent to limit the principles of the present invention to the particular disclosed embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Referring to the figures, a motor grader is shown generally at <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and includes a wheeled chassis <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having a pair of laterally spaced front wheels <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and two pairs of laterally spaced rear wheels <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. An engine <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> drives rear wheels <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to propel the motor grader along a roadbed <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> or other ground surface, and an operator cab <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is supported on chassis <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> just ahead of engine <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> As well understood by those skilled in the art, a fore-and-aft drawbar <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is attached to the front of the chassis <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by a ball joint or the like (not shown). Drawbar <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> extends rearwardly from the front ball joint and underneath the upwardly arched chassis <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to support a blade or moldboard <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> that can be adjusted in a number of different directions to assume a variety of adjusted positions. In this regard, as is conventional, moldboard <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> can be adjusted upwardly and downwardly by a pair of left and right lift cylinders <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, each of which can be independently operated so as to change the left-to-right tilt of moldboard <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. A side shift cylinder (not shown) enables moldboard <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to be shifted laterally to the left or right relative to drawbar <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and a fore-and-aft tilt cylinder <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) is coupled to moldboard <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in such a manner that moldboard <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> can be tipped forwardly or rearwardly about a lower transverse axis to adjust its angle of attack relative to the ground. Moldboard <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> can also be rotated about a vertical axis by means not shown to place moldboard <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in an oblique attitude relative to the direction of travel of the motor grader, although in connection with the present invention moldboard <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> will normally be perpendicular to the path of travel as illustrated in the plan view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In connection with the present invention, motor grader <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is provided with a material distribution attachment comprising two primary components, i.e., a distribution hopper <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> at the front of the machine and a screed <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> attached to moldboard <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in the middle of the machine. Dealing first with hopper <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, it will be seen that such structure generally comprises an open top receptacle having a set of ground engaging wheels <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The upper front edge <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of hopper <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is lower than the upper rear edge <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> thereof so as to facilitate loading of hopper <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> with granular materials from a dump truck <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> during operation as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and as will subsequently be explained in more detail. The exterior of hopper <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> includes a pair of opposite, left and right sidewalls <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> respectively, an upright exterior front wall <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, and an upright rear wall <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> that begins at the upper rear edge <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and extends part way down the back of hopper <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. A sloping bottom wall <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> extends downwardly and forwardly from the lower extremity of rear wall <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> generally toward front wall <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> but terminates a short distance rearwardly from front wall <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. A horizontal, relatively short lowermost wall <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> interconnects the lower extremity of front wall <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the forward extremity of bottom wall <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Inside hopper <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, a downwardly and rearwardly sloping interior front wall <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> extends from a point part way up exterior front wall <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> down to the forward extremity of bottom wall <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. A pair of downwardly and inwardly sloping interior sidewalls <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> converge toward the center of the hopper and intersect bottom wall <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and the front interior wall <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Front wall <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> carries a pair of horizontal rollers <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> that bear against the rear tires <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of dump truck <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> during operation as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The discharge outlet of hopper <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is broadly denoted by the numeral <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and is located in bottom wall <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> adjacent the intersection with front interior wall <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Outlet <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is controlled by a pair of side-by-side metering gates <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> that are independently shiftable along inclined paths of travel parallel to bottom wall <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> between positions opening and closing respective left and right halves of outlet <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2,6</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, gates <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> are shown in their open position. A pair of independently operable hydraulic piston and cylinder assemblies <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> (only one being illustrated; see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>) actuate gates <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> between their open and closed positions, the rear ends of the cylinders <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> being attached to rearwardly projecting, horizontally disposed mounts <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> on the rear of hopper <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 7</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> A transverse agitating rotor <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> spans outlet <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> a short distance thereabove for the purpose of keeping materials agitated and loose near the bottom of hopper <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to facilitate their discharge through outlet <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. Opposite ends of rotor <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> pass through interior sidewalls <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> for ultimate rotational support by suitable bearings located behind such interior walls. The drive for rotor <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is located outboard of interior sidewall <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and inboard of outer sidewall <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 8</cross-reference>. Such drive includes a hydraulic motor <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>) having an output shaft (not shown) that carries a sprocket <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. An endless chain <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is entrained around sprocket <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and around a second sprocket <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> that is fixed to the outboard end of rotor <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. An adjustable idler sprocket <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> engages the slack side of chain <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> to maintain tension in the chain. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Hopper <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is attached to the front end of chassis <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by mounting apparatus broadly denoted by the numeral <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. Apparatus <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> comprises a centrally disposed, upright tower or mast <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> that is fixedly secured to the chassis <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by suitable means such as bolts (not shown). An upright hydraulic cylinder <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>) within mast <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> is operably coupled with the upper backside of hopper <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> via suitable coupling means broadly denoted by the numeral <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> so that extension and retraction of cylinder <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> causes hopper <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to be raised and lowered relative to mast <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>. It is contemplated that during normal working operations, hopper <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> will be fully lowered so that ground wheels <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are touching the ground and supporting the load of hopper <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and its contents. On the other hand, for transport purposes between job sites, hopper <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may be elevated along mast <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and supported in a raised, transport position (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> An operator seat <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is attached to the backside of hopper <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> near the left end thereof and at such a height that an operator stationed at seat <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> can observe both loading of hopper <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and discharging of material from the hopper. A set of controls <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) are easily accessible to the operator positioned on seat <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, such controls <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> being operably connected to gate cylinders <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> so that the operator may regulate the positions of gates <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. The lift cylinder <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> which raises and lowers hopper <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is controlled by a suitable control (not shown) located in cab <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. A pair of upwardly and rearwardly projecting indicator rods <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> are fixed to respective doors <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> to provide a visual indication for the operator at seat <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the position of gates <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, which can be important when outlet <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is covered by material within hopper <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. It will be noted from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> in particular that outlet <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is slightly narrower than the width of the space between front wheels <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> such that material discharged through outlet <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> forms what may be termed a ribbon or swath of material having a width no greater than the space between the wheels. Because outlet <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is centered between wheels <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the wheels become disposed on opposite sides of the material swath during discharging and spreading operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> A hook <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> at the front end of hopper <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>) may be used to detachably secure the truck <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to the front end of hopper <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Hook <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is operated manually by a linkage <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> that runs across the hopper <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and up the left side thereof outboard of left sidewall <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Linkage <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> terminates at its upper end in an operating handle <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> positioned for actuation by the operator stationed on seat <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The screed <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is generally V-shaped in overall configuration when viewed in plan, presenting a pointed body having a nose <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and a pair of oppositely extending, swept-back, left and right wings <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Generally speaking, the wings <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> present a forwardly pointed lower screeding edge <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) that determines the thickness or depth of the layer of materials formed by the screed. Each of the wings <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> has as its primary component a tubular, square in cross-section beam <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> that is joined at its inner end with the beam <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> of the other wing. An upright panel or wall <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> is secured to and extends along the front of each beam <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> to prevent material from flowing up and over the top edge of the beam during operation. Wall <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is secured to beam <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> by a fence <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> that includes four uprights <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. Each of the uprights <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> is securely affixed at its upper end to wall <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> but is spaced slightly rearwardly from such wall below the point of attachment so as to define a transverse slot <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> between fence <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> and the backside of wall <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> for a purpose yet-to-be-explained. A slide strip <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is fixed to the top surface of beam <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> along the front edge thereof and is generally co-extensive in length with fence <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Each wing <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is adjustably extendable and retractable to vary its effective length, thus adjusting the overall width of screed <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. In this regard, each wing <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> includes an extendable and retractable wing tip <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> that is shifted in or out by a hydraulic cylinder <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> housed within beam <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. Each wing <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> is formed in part by a second tubular beam <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> that is of rectangular cross-section and has slightly smaller dimensions than main beam <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. Thus, wing tip beam <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> is telescopically received within main beam <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and is guided in its telescoping reciprocation by a pair of spacer plates <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) fixed to front and bottom walls of main beam <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> respectively (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3, 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Each wing tip beam <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> has its own front wall extension <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> that is received within horizontal slot <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> between fence <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> and front wall <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. The lower edge of front wall extension <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> rides upon slide strip <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> on main wing beam <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. Each front wall extension <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> is welded at its outer vertical edge to an upright member <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> that is in turn welded along its bottom edge to the wing tip beam <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Each main beam <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> has three generally L-shaped brackets <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> welded to the top surface thereof and projecting rearwardly therefrom at spaced locations therealong. The downturned outer legs of brackets <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> support a guide strap <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> that extends parallel to main beam <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> in rearwardly spaced relation thereto. Guide strap <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> bears against and reciprocably guides a trailing tubular, rectangular in cross-section wing tip beam <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> that is spaced slightly behind and extends parallel to the first wing tip beam <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, trailing wing tip beam <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> projects downwardly below the level of wing tip beam <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> to the same extent as the main beam <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. Thus, even though the lower extremity of the front wing tip beam <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> is not quite as low to the ground as main beam <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, this difference is made up for by the trailing wing tip beam <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> such that, in effect, the lower front edge <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> of screed <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is at the same level along the full length of the wing from the inner end to the outer end thereof, even when the wing tip <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> is fully extended. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The trailing wing tip beam <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> is fixed at its outer end to the front wing tip beam <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> via a fore-and-aft extending plate <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3, 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) that spans the outer ends of beams <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> and is welded thereto and to the upright member <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>. At its inner end the trailing wing tip beam <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> has a rectangular lug <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight> welded thereto that projects forwardly into overlying relationship with the top surface of main beam <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, for the purpose of helping to support and guide trailing wing tip beam <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> during its extension and retraction. A long guide strip <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> is welded to the rear face of main beam <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and bears against the front face of trailing wing tip beam <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> during adjusting reciprocation of the latter. Thus, during such adjusting movement of trailing wing tip beam <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>, the beam is trapped between rearwardly disposed guide strap <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> on the one hand and forwardly disposed guide strip <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> on the other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Trailing wing tip beam <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> is also supported by a relatively short rectangular plate <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> that is housed within trailing wing tip beam <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> and bears against the upper inside surface of the top wall of such beam. At its inboard end, plate <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is supported by an upright bolt <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> that passes through a slot <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> in the top wall of trailing wing tip beam <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>. Bolt <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> is suspended from the rear end of a support plate <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> that is fixed at its front end to the upper surface of main wing beam <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. At its outboard end the plate <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is supported by an upright bolt <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> that hangs from the rearwardly extending, horizontal leg <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> of a generally L-shaped mounting bracket <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> having an upright leg <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> that is attached to the lower rear extremity of moldboard <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> via attaching bolts <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight>. Mounting bracket <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> is not fixed to but instead merely overlies main beam <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. Support plate <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> has an upstanding handle <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> of generally T-shaped configuration that projects upwardly through slot <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> in trailing wing beam <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>. The head of handle <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> is wider than slot <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> such that when bolts <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> are removed, support plate <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> cannot fall to the inside bottom surface of trailing wing tip beam <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> and become inaccessible. In addition to this keeping or retaining function, the head of handle <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> is also adapted to be grasped manually during assembly and disassembly operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The outermost ends of wings <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> are provided with upright shields <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> respectively that confine the material as it is being leveled and spread laterally by screed <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Each of the shields <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> is bolted to the fore-and-aft plate <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> of wing tip <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and projects forwardly a substantial distance therefrom. Each shield <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> can be height adjusted by virtue of a slotted relationship with the bolts that secure the shield to plate <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The two mounting brackets <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> at opposite ends of moldboard <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> serve as components of mounting structure that secure the screed <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to moldboard <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. In addition to brackets <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>, such mounting structure also includes an upstanding lug <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> on screed <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> at nose <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, a corresponding lug <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> fixed to the backside of moldboard <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> at the lateral center thereof near its top edge, and a rigid link <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> pivotally connected at its opposite ends to lugs <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight>. Screed <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is thus securely attached to moldboard <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and is held against significant movement relative thereto. However, by virtue of the various hydraulic cylinders that adjust moldboard <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, screed <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> can likewise be adjusted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Operation </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Operation and use of the distribution attachment in accordance with the present invention should be apparent from the foregoing description. With particular reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, however, a brief further description of the operation is in order. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> During use, one operator is positioned within cab <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and a second operator is positioned at seat <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The operator in cab <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> controls forward motion of grader <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, as well as lifting and lowering of hopper <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, extension and retraction of wings <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, up and down adjustment of screed <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, and fore-and-aft tilting of screed <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> for controlling the crown applied to the material, if any. Depending upon the depth of the layer of material to be placed on roadbed <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, screed <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> will be adjusted closer to or further above the roadbed. A corresponding adjustment of side shields <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> may be necessary to assure that the lower edges thereof are engaging and riding along roadbed <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> during forward movement of the grader. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> A dump truck <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is backed up to the grader until its tires <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> come into abutting engagement with rollers <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> on the front of hopper <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, which has previously been lowered sufficiently to place its wheels <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in contacting engagement with roadbed <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. As the bed of truck <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is raised as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, material is discharged from the bed into and through the open top of hopper <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> where it begins to issue from discharge outlet <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. As the grader is then advanced, the grader pushes truck <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> along with it so that the contents of the truck are continuously discharged into the awaiting hopper <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> at a rate determined by the tilt angle of the truck bed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The operator situated on seat <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> observes the ongoing process and adjusts gates <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> as may be necessary or desirable to suitably regulate the flow of material as it emanates out of the bottom of hopper <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, such discharged material forms a swath <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> that is disposed between front wheels <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the grader, due to the central location of outlet <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and the fact that it is no wider than the distance between such front wheels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> As the screed <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> then engages the discharged swath <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, the top portion of the swath is skimmed off and deflected laterally outwardly in opposite directions due to the swept back nature of wings <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of screed <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Swath <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is thus widened out and leveled down to produce in one pass a final layer <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> behind screed <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> having a width determined by the outboard shields <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> This process of unloading materials from truck <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, metering them out of hopper <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, and spreading them with screed <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> continues on an ongoing, non-stop basis until the truck is empty. At that time, forward motion of the grader is halted, and the truck pulls away to obtain a new supply of material, during which time the next loaded truck maybe backed into position at the front of hopper <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Once the next truck is properly positioned, the grader begins to advance again, continuing the process that was temporarily halted when the previous truck became empty. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In many instances there will be no need to engage the retaining hook <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> with the truck. However, where the roadbed or other surface is sloping down hill, it may be advisable to secure the hook <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> onto the truck to assure maintenance of the proper relationship between the truck and hopper <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> illustrates one example of a crown that can be imparted to the layer of materials <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> on roadbed <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. By cocking up screed <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to a slight extent at its leading extremity, the nose <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> of screed <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> will be slightly higher than the outer ends of its wings <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Consequently, layer <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> will be provided with a positive crown that is somewhat higher in the center than at its outer ends, and there will be a gentle slope in opposite left and right directions from the central crown. In one preferred embodiment, the crown can be varied between a six-inch negative crown and six-inch positive crown. Of course, layer <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> can also be configured to have essentially no crown at all and to instead be essentially perfectly flat from one lateral extremity to the other. It is also contemplated that the wings <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> maybe extended to such an extent that the overall width of screed <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> can be varied from twelve feet to twenty feet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Although preferred forms of the invention have been described above, it is to be recognized that such disclosure is by way of illustration only, and should not be utilized in a limiting sense in interpreting the scope of the present invention. Obvious modifications to the exemplary embodiments, as hereinabove set forth, could be readily made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The inventor(s) hereby state(s) his/their intent to rely on the Doctrine of Equivalents to determine and assess the reasonably fair scope of his/their invention as pertains to any apparatus not materially departing from but outside the literal scope of the invention as set out in the following claims. </paragraph>
