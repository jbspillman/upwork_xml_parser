<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to aircraft table tops, and more particularly to lightweight aircraft table tops of composite materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Cabins of corporate aircraft, such as corporate jets, often have passenger chairs and pull-out tables adjacent the chairs. A typical pull-out table comprises a table top mounted via a support mechanism to a side wall of the cabin. The support mechanism enables the table top to be moved between a stowed position and a deployed position. The table top, when in its stowed position, is hid within a compartment in the side wall of the cabin. The table top, when in its deployed position, extends generally horizontally from the side wall of the cabin toward the center of the cabin. The table top is generally of a honeycomb composite construction and may be of a single leaf design or may have two leaves hinged together (e.g., a proximal leaf adjacent the cabin&apos;s side wall and a distal leaf extending toward the center of the cabin). The table top may be of a cantilever design in which a proximal end of the proximal leaf is attached to the cabin&apos;s side wall and a proximal end of the distal leaf is attached via hinges to a distal end of the proximal leaf. In some such table tops, each leaf tapers generally from one end to the other to provide greater leg room under the deployed table and to provide a compact design capable of being stowed within the side wall. Because of the cantilever design, greater stresses are exerted on the table top at the proximal end than at the distal end. Thus, of the two leafs, it is probably more important for the proximal leaf to be tapered than for the distal leaf to be tapered. To achieve this taper, each leaf is formed of multiple honeycomb elements with each element having a honeycomb core sandwiched between two generally rigid skins. The honeycomb elements are stacked such that the leaf is multiple honeycomb layers thick. Each leaf further includes upper and lower veneer layers covered with a protective coating, such as a urethane, to give the table top a pleasing appearance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A disadvantage associated with such table tops is the skill and effort required to manufacture the tapered leaves. Because each leaf has multiple honeycomb elements, many steps are required to manufacture the leaf. Also, although the table tops are generally light weight, the presence of multiple honeycomb elements increases the weight. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Among the several objects and advantages of the present invention may be noted the provision of an improved table top and table top leaf; the provision of such a table top leaf which is more economical to manufacture than prior art table top leaves without sacrificing strength or durability; the provision of such a table top leaf which may be manufactured more quickly than prior art table top leaves; and the provision of such a table top leaf which is lighter than prior art table to leaves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Generally, a lightweight aircraft table top member of the present invention has first and second opposite end margins. The table top member comprises first and second skin panels of sheet material, and a honeycomb core. Each skin panel extends longitudinally from the first end margin to the second end margin. The honeycomb core is between the first and second skin panels and bonded thereto. The core extends longitudinally from the first end margin to the second end margin and has a cellular structure with each of a plurality of cells thereof extending from the first skin panel to the second skin panel. Each of the plurality of cells has a first cell end in contact with the first skin panel and a second cell end in contact with the second skin panel. Each of the plurality of cells has a cell length equal to the distance between its first and second cell ends. The cell lengths of some of the plurality of cells is at least 150% as long as those of some others of the plurality of cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the present invention is a table top member comprising a honeycomb core, an upper skin panel of sheet material and a lower skin panel of sheet material. The honeycomb core extends longitudinally from the first end margin to the second end margin. The honeycomb core has a first end generally adjacent the first end margin and an opposite second end generally adjacent the second end margin. The honeycomb core has a top surface and a bottom surface. The honeycomb core further has a cellular structure with each of a plurality of cells thereof having a top edge and a bottom edge. Each of the plurality of cells has a cell length equal to the distance between its top and bottom edges. The top edges of the plurality of cells define the core&apos;s top surface. The bottom edges of the plurality of cells define the core&apos;s bottom surface. The honeycomb core includes first cells, second cells and midway cells. The first cells constitute some cells of the plurality of cells adjacent the core&apos;s first end. The second cells constitute some cells of the plurality of cells adjacent the core&apos;s second end. The midway cells constitute some cells of the plurality of cells located generally midway between the core&apos;s first and second ends. The upper skin panel of sheet material has an upper face and a lower face. The lower face of the upper skin panel is bonded to the core&apos;s top surface. The lower skin panel of sheet material has an upper face and a lower face. The upper face of the lower skin panel is bonded to the core&apos;s bottom surface. The honeycomb core tapers in thickness from its first end to its second end such that the length of each of the midway cells is less than the length of each of the first cells and such that the length of each of the second cells is less than the length of each of the midway cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the present invention comprises a lightweight aircraft table top member having a first end margin adapted to be operatively connected to the aircraft and a second end margin longitudinally spaced from and opposite the first end margin. The table top member comprises a honeycomb core, an upper skin panel of sheet material, and a lower skin panel of sheet material. The honeycomb core extends longitudinally from the first end margin to the second end margin. The honeycomb core has a first end generally adjacent the first end margin and an opposite second end generally adjacent the second end margin. The honeycomb core has a top surface and a bottom surface. The honeycomb core further has a cellular structure with each of a plurality of cells thereof having a top edge and a bottom edge. Each of the plurality of cells has a cell length equal to the distance between its top and bottom edges. The top edges of the plurality of cells define the core&apos;s top surface and the bottom edges of the plurality of cells define the core&apos;s bottom surface. The upper skin panel of sheet material has an upper face and a lower face. The lower face of the upper skin panel is bonded to the core&apos;s top surface. The lower skin panel of sheet material has an upper face and a lower face. The upper face of the lower skin panel is bonded to the core&apos;s bottom surface. The upper and lower skin panels each have laterally extending first edges adjacent the core&apos;s first end and laterally extending second edges adjacent the core&apos;s second end. The first edge of the upper skin panel is spaced from the first edge of the lower skin panel a first distance. The second edge of the upper skin panel is spaced from the second edge of the lower skin panel a second distance. The second distance is less than the first distance. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the drawings, and first more particularly to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> lightweight aircraft table top of the present invention is generally indicated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The table top <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> comprises a proximal (first) table top leaf, generally indicated at <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and a distal (second) table top leaf, generally indicated at <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. As discussed below, the distal table top leaf <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is connected to the proximal table top leaf <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> via hinges. The proximal table top leaf <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is attached to a side wall <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of a cabin of an aircraft, such as a corporate jet, via a support mechanism (not shown). The support mechanism enables the table top <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to be moved between a stowed position (not shown) and a deployed position (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). The table top <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, when in its stowed position, is hid within a compartment in the side wall <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the cabin. The table top, when in its deployed position extends generally horizontally from the side wall of the cabin toward the center of the cabin. This specification uses the terms &ldquo;proximal&rdquo; and &ldquo;distal&rdquo; which are to be distinguished from one another. The term &ldquo;proximal&rdquo; means the one closest to the side wall <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the cabin and the term &ldquo;distal&rdquo; means the one farthest from the side wall of the cabin. These terms are used to assist the reader in an understanding of the embodiment. However, these terms are not to be read into the claims to limit the invention in any way unless these terms are specifically incorporated into the claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Referring now to FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the proximal table top leaf <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> comprises a primary honeycomb composite member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and a secondary honeycomb composite member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> secured to a top surface of the primary member. The primary honeycomb composite member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has a proximal (first) end margin <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> adapted to be operatively connected to the cabin&apos;s side wall <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and a distal (second) end margin <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> longitudinally spaced from and opposite the proximal end margin. The primary honeycomb composite member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> comprises a honeycomb core, generally indicated at <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, an upper skin panel of sheet material <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and a lower skin panel of sheet material <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the honeycomb core <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is of paper and the upper and lower skin panels <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are of fiberglass. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The honeycomb core <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> extends longitudinally from the proximal end margin <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to the distal end margin <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The honeycomb core <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> has a proximal (first) end generally adjacent the proximal end margin <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and an opposite distal (second) end generally adjacent the second end margin. The honeycomb core <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> has a top surface <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and a bottom surface <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The honeycomb core <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> has many cells <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and is of a cellular structure with each of a plurality of cells thereof having a top edge and a bottom edge. Most of the cells <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are open cells <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. However, the cells adjacent the edge are preferably filled with a suitable edge fill. Each of the plurality of cells <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> has a cell length equal to the distance between its top and bottom edges. The top edges of the plurality of cells define the top surface <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the core <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and the bottom edges of the plurality of cells define the bottom surface <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the core. The upper skin panel <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is preferably generally planar and has an upper face <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and a lower face <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The lower face <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the upper skin panel <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is bonded to the core&apos;s top surface <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The lower skin panel <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is preferably generally planar and has an upper face <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and a lower face <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The upper face <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the lower skin panel <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is bonded to the core&apos;s bottom surface <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, the honeycomb core includes proximal (first) cells <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, distal (second) cells <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and midway cells <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. The proximal cells <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> constitute some cells of the plurality of cells adjacent the core&apos;s proximal end. The distal cells <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> constitute some cells of the plurality of cells adjacent the core&apos;s distal end. The midway cells <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> constitute some cells of the plurality of cells located generally midway between the core&apos;s proximal and distal ends <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The honeycomb core tapers in thickness from its proximal end to its distal end such that the length of each of the midway cells <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is less than the length of each of the proximal cells <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and such that the length of each of the distal cells <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is less than the length of each of the midway cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the upper skin panel <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is bonded to the top edges of the proximal, distal, and midway cells <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, and the lower skin panel <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is bonded to the lower edges of the proximal, distal, and midway cells. A proximal (first) edge of the upper skin panel <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is spaced a first distance d<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>(<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) from a proximal (first) edge of the lower skin panel <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. A distal (second) edge of the upper skin panel <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is spaced a second distance d<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>from a distal (second) edge of the lower skin panel <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the second distance d<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is less than the first distance d<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>. Also preferably, the first distance is equal to the cell length of the proximal cells <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and the second distance is equal to the cell length of the distal cells <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Because the upper and lower skin panels <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are preferably generally planar, they converge toward one another as they extend from the proximal end margin to the distal end margin. Preferably, the second distance is at least 20% as great as the first distance but less than 75% as great as the first distance. In the preferred embodiment, the first distance may be 1.5 inches and the second distance may be 0.5 inches. However, it is to be understood that the first and second distances may vary depending upon the characteristics desired of the table top. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The secondary honeycomb composite member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> preferably has an aluminum core with fiberglass skins. The secondary honeycomb composite member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is bonded to the upper skin panel <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the primary member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> via a suitable adhesive, such as 3M&reg; 1357 adhesive. The distal table top leaf <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> includes an upper honeycomb composite member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, a lower honeycomb composite member <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and a shim <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. The upper honeycomb composite member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is similar to the secondary composite member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The lower honeycomb composite member <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is preferably a relatively thin honeycomb composite member having a paper core and fiberglass skins. The shim <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is positioned between and bonded to the proximal edge margin of the upper composite member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and the proximal edge margin of the lower composite member <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. The distal edge margin of the upper composite member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is bonded to the distal edge margin of the lower composite member <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the edges of all of the honeycomb composite members are filled with Epocast 87269A and B filler <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> to enable wood trim and fastener members to be attached to the composite members. Preferably, the edges are filled to a thickness of one and one-half cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The distal table top leaf <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is attached to the proximal table top leaf <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> via one or more hinges <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). Preferably, a first wood strip <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is bonded to the distal ends of the primary and secondary honeycomb composite members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the proximal table top leaf <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and a second wood strip <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is bonded to the proximal end of the upper honeycomb composite member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of the distal leaf <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The hinges <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> are secured to the wood strips <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. The table top <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> further includes decorative wood trim pieces <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> along the edges of the composite members. Preferably, the upper surface of the secondary honeycomb composite member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the upper surface of the upper honeycomb composite member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of the distal leaf <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the lower surface of the lower honeycomb composite member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of the distal leaf are covered with decorative wood veneer panels <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. The table top <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> also preferably includes a decorative gold inlay <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> around one or more of the wood veneer panels <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. The lower surface of the primary honeycomb composite member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be covered by a suitable laminate <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Although a particular structure for the distal leaf has been described, it is to be understood that other distal leaf structures may be incorporated without departing from the scope of the present invention. Also, it is envisioned that that the a table top of the present invention could comprise a single leaf. Moreover, although the table top has been described as preferably having certain cosmetic items (e.g., wood trim, veneer, gold inlay, etc.) it is to be understood some or all of these cosmetic items could be eliminated without departing from the scope of this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In view of the above, it will be seen that the several objects of the invention are achieved and other advantageous results attained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> As various changes could be made in the above constructions without departing from the scope of the invention, it is intended that all matter contained in the above description or shown in the accompanying drawings shall be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense. </paragraph>
