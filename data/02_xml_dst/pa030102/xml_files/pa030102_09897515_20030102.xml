<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates in general to a dolly for transporting doors. In particular, the invention relates to a dolly for transporting doors that can also be used as a stand for holding a door while work is performed on the door. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Dollies for carrying large flat sheets of materials are well known. Dollies have also been devised specifically for carrying doors, usually with the door oriented substantially as installed, that is, with the longest dimension vertical. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> On construction sites, it is often desirable to position the door with the sides horizontal, such as when planing edges and installing hinge plates. Conventional dollies usually require the door to be removed, turned ninety degrees, and placed back on the dolly, assuming the particular dolly is even capable of holding the door in this position. A dolly that can be readily repositioned to act as a stand to hold the door sideways without the need to remove and reposition the door is very desirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,746,141, issued to Willis on May 24, 1988, discloses a collapsible door carrier that can be placed on its side to act as a stand. A longer side leg attaches to a bottom leg via a hinge for collapsibility, and a wheel and axle assembly attaches to the side leg near the junction with the bottom leg. The side leg is bisected by another hinge for further collapsibility. A projection located on the side leg distal to the bottom leg provides means to hold the side leg level when the carrier is tipped onto its side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The Willis device has several drawbacks. Braces are required to support the hinged junction of the bottom and side legs for carrying a typical load. A hinged angle brace is mounted on each side of the side leg and the bottom leg, forming the hypotenuse of a forty-five degree right triangle with the side leg and the bottom leg during normal use. The braces are an obstruction when placing a door in the carrier or removing it therefrom. If care is not taken during placement and removal, the door can strike or scrape against the braces, causing damage to the door&apos;s finish. Making the carrier collapsible significantly increases the complexity, parts count and cost of the Willis device and reduces its durability. Collapsibility is not considered a sufficiently necessary feature to outweigh the disadvantages, since there is normally enough storage space available to store a door carrier that will not collapse. Finally, the Willis device has a handle mounted at right angles to the plane containing the side and bottom legs. This handle presents a tripping hazard when the side leg is level with the ground. The handle can also be stepped on, causing the carrier and its load to tip over onto the user. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In general, a structure that avoids the drawbacks of existing devices is achieved by a bottom leg rigidly attached to a side leg, an axle and wheel assembly attached to the side leg near the junction with the bottom leg, and a side support attached to the side leg distal to the axle in the plane with the side leg and the bottom leg. A wheel and axle assembly is attached to the side leg near the junction with the bottom leg, and provides the means for rotating the door dolly between a first position wherein the bottom leg is substantially level with the ground and a second position wherein the side leg is substantially level with the ground. &ldquo;Substantially level&rdquo; as used in this specification and the claims is defined as parallel plus or minus about one degree. The side support preferably is a substantially rectangular loop, with the longer side parallel to the side leg. The loop can also act as a handle for holding and directing the door dolly when transporting a door. The use of a loop provides a large surface for contact with the ground when used as a side leg support, and is inherently coplanar with the side leg and the bottom leg, without projections that could present a safety hazard. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Further features and advantages of the invention will become apparent in the following detailed description and in the drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>shows the preferred embodiment of the door dolly <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the invention being used to carry a door <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The door dolly <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> includes a bottom leg <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, a side leg <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, a handle <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> attached to the side leg <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, and a wheel and axle assembly <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> attached to the side leg <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> near the junction with the bottom leg <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the bottom leg <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is an elongated, U-shaped channel with a liner <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> made from a soft material such as carpeting or a soft wood to protect the door&apos;s finish. The bottom leg <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> provides the means for supporting the bottom edge <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the door while transporting the door. If desired, another liner <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> made of wood, carpeting, or other soft, non-scratching material can be applied to protect the door bottom edge <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Obviously, the top edge <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> of the door can be equally well supported by the bottom leg <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> if desired. The length of the bottom leg <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> should be at least about sixty-five percent of the length of the door&apos;s bottom edge <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> for proper support. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The side leg <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> uses the same construction as the bottom leg <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, but is longer for proper support of the door <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> when the door dolly <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is used as a stand. The length of the side leg <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> should be at least about eighty percent of the length of the door&apos;s side edge <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> for proper support. The side leg <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is a single rigid piece, without added structure to make the leg collapsible or telescoping. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Both the bottom leg <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the side leg <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> can be made with other configurations, so long as the particular configuration performs the critical functions of securely supporting the particular edge, and preventing the edge from falling off the device. For example, a flat bar can be used for each leg, with upright retaining flanges set at intervals along the length of the bar. Clamps can be used in place of flanges, but are discouraged since they add cost and complexity, and usually have projecting parts that can present a safety hazard. As another example, a leg having an shallow arcuate cross-section can be used in place of the preferred U-shaped channel or the flat bar with retaining elements. Other configurations known in the art can also be used within the scope of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> As already described, a wheel and axle assembly <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is attached to the side leg <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> near the junction with the bottom leg <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. As shown in detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the axle <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is located so that each wheel <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> extends about one-eighth inch (three millimeters) below the bottom edge <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of the bottom leg <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. This distance can be varied, the objective being to situate the bottom leg <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> close enough to the floor so that it can be wheeled under an installed door prior to removing the door from the surrounding doorframe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The handle <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is located on the side leg <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> on the distal end from the junction of the side leg <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the bottom leg <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Five-eighth inch nominal diameter (sixteen millimeter) cold-rolled iron pipe is preferred because it is durable, inexpensive and easy to shape, but other materials can be used, such as square metal tubing. The shape of the handle <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is not critical, except that it should be substantially planar and the portion <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> of the handle farthest from the side leg <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> should be straight and long enough to present a large surface area for contacting a floor, the ground, or a similarly flat, level support surface when the dolly is laid on its side as described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The dolly is designed to operate generally in three different positions. The wheel and axle assembly provide a pivot to permit the door dolly to be turned easily from one position to another. In the first position, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the door dolly <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is used to pick up and transport the door. In this position, the bottom leg <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is substantially level with the ground. In the next position, the dolly is tilted about the axle <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> with the bottom leg <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> at an angle of about five to forty degrees with respect to the floor, so that the door can be transported, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. In the last position, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the dolly is turned about ninety degrees from the first position, so that the side leg is substantially level with the ground. The side leg is supported in this position by the wheels <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and by the handle <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, which now functions as a support leg. In this position, work can be performed on the door, such as planing edges and installing hinge plates. As previously discussed, the handle should have a fairly large straight portion <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> contacting the floor in this position to give greater stability to the dolly <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The portion <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> contacting the floor can be widened somewhat for greater lateral stability, but the handle <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> should remain substantially coplanar with the side leg <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the bottom leg <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, meaning that no part of the handle <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> should extend further than about an inch (25 millimeters) beyond the edges of the side leg <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> in a direction perpendicular to the plane containing the side leg <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the bottom leg <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The invention has several advantages over the prior art. The door dolly is simple in design, but is rugged and durable. It has no complicated moving parts, and a minimum of edges and surfaces that can damage the door&apos;s finish. The handle does not present a safety hazard while the side leg is placed parallel to the floor. Since all the major parts except the axle and wheels lie in a single plane, the dolly can be stored along a wall, taking up minimal space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The invention has been shown in only one embodiment, although alternative embodiments have been described. It should be apparent to those skilled in the art that the invention is not limited to these embodiments, but is capable of being varied and modified without departing from the scope of the invention as set out in the attached claims. </paragraph>
