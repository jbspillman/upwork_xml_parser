<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention is generally related to a latch assembly for an electronic device. More specifically, the invention is generally related to a specially designed latch assembly and the associated method for its assembly. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Many computer related and other electronic devices generally include a chassis, cabinet or housing. During assembly and use, the chassis, cabinet or housing is selectively opened or closed. As such, one or more latches are typically provided. Because computer and other electronic devices are typically manufactured in enormous volumes, the cost of the components and the associated assembly time and complexity are important aspects of the design. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> One prior art design for a latch assembly commonly utilized on a computer or other electronic device chassis, cabinet or housing (generally referred to as a &ldquo;workpiece&rdquo;) is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The prior art latch assembly includes a lever, a latch, two pivot pins and a compression spring. One of the pins is used to pivotally mount the latch assembly to the workpiece. The other pin and the compression spring are required to assemble the latch to the lever in an operative configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Identified shortcomings of this and other similar prior art latch designs include the extra cost of both the compression spring and latch pin to hold the latch and lever together. Furthermore, during assembly and installation of the latch design shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, great difficulty in aligning the latch with the spring and in aligning the latch, the lever and the latch pin for proper assembly resulted in a very complex and time consuming assembly and installation procedure. The latch design of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> does not include appropriate features that allow for the registration and proper location of the latch relative to the lever during assembly. Therefore, great attention to the assembly procedure is required. Moreover, the spring and latch pin are both relatively tiny parts that are difficult to manipulate and hold in place during the assembly procedure of the latch assembly of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The prior art latch design of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is also not conducive to automation during the assembly process. The prior art design takes too much time to assemble and the throughput of the end product in the manufacturing process is relatively low. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Therefore, in view of these and other problems associated with known types of latch assemblies, there is a need for an improved latch assembly design that can be efficiently and economically assembled, and that is easy to operate and provides an effective and secure closure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Further, an improved latch design must satisfy both aesthetic and ergonomic requirements. Specifically, since the latch design is typically used on a consumer item, such a component must have a pleasing and appealing shape or appearance. From an ergonomic perspective, since prior art latch assemblies are in use in a large number of existing computer and electronic devices, the overall operation of an improved latch assembly must not be significantly altered. Otherwise, a user having both the improved and prior art latch designs could be confused. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The invention meets and exceeds the above-described and other needs by providing an improved latch assembly design for use on computer-related and other electronic devices, generally referred to as workpieces. In a present embodiment of this invention, a latch assembly is adapted to be pivotally coupled to a workpiece such as a computer or other electronic device chassis, cabinet or housing. The latch assembly includes a latch that has a grip for actuation of the latch by a user to and between an engaged position and a disengaged position. A hook is also provided on the latch to engage a catch on the workpiece when the latch is in the engaged position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The latch includes an elongate spring arm that is integrally formed with the latch to bias the hook into engagement with the catch. The latch also includes a pair of pivot pins that are integrally formed with the latch and define a pivot access about which the latch pivots to and between the engaged and disengaged positions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, the latch with the integrally formed spring arm and pivot pins is manually snap-fit into a lever to complete the latch assembly. The lever includes a pair of pivot holes into which the pivot pins on the latch are snap-fit to pivotally couple the latch and the lever together. A lead-in ramp is configured in the lever proximate each of the pivot holes to guide the pivot pins into the holes during the assembly process. In one embodiment of this invention, the lever includes a pair of pockets, each of which are adapted to receive therein one of the spring fingers projecting from a terminal end of the spring arm on the latch. As a result, the lever has a pocket design that allows the lever to accept the spring arm of the latch and thereby minimize the need for extra parts and a separate compression spring. The pocket in the lever captures the spring arm and induces a preload in the latch assembly to ensure that the latch simply stays in the engaged position until actuated by a user. The lever includes a stop to contact the spring arm and limit the movement of the spring arm between the engaged and disengaged positions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> As a result, an improved latch design according to this invention uses a snap-in feature that eliminates the need for a separate pivot pin coupling the latch and lever together. Additionally, the integrally formed spring arm on the latch eliminates the need for a compression spring. The improved latch design has the pin and spring arm molded integrally with the latch. As such, the extra cost of the pin and the spring used in the prior art designs is eliminated. Assembly of the latch and the lever together is simply accomplished by snapping the spring arm into the pocket in the lever without the need for special tooling or complex procedures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The lever itself is modified only slightly to incorporate the pocket. Changes to the latch and lever appliance and the operation of the latch assembly are minimal to accomplish both the aesthetic and ergonomic objectives of an improved design. As such, the improved latch assembly incorporates specific changes to existing parts while still providing for the reduction of costs, parts and assembly procedures. The improved design much more easily accommodates automatic assembly equipment to further reduce assembly costs and increase productivity rates. Moreover, the improved design provides the same feel and function as existing designs thereby satisfying ergonomic requirements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> These and other advantages and features which characterize the invention, are set forth in the claims annexed hereto and in forming a further part hereof. However, for a better understanding of the invention, and of the advantages and objectives attained through its use, reference should be made to the drawings, and to the accompanying descriptive matter, in which exemplary embodiments of the invention are described.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Turning to the Drawings, wherein like numbers denote like parts throughout the several views, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a prior art latch assembly <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as previously described herein. Briefly, the prior art latch assembly <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> includes a lever <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> which is pivotally coupled to a mounting block <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> having a pivot pin aperture <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> there through. The lever <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> likewise includes a pivot pin aperture <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> through which a lever pin <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is inserted. Furthermore, the prior art latch assembly <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> includes a compression spring <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to bias a latch <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> into an engaged position so that a hook <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> on the latch <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> may engage a catch <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> on the workpiece <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> for closure of the latch assembly <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The latch <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is pivotally coupled to the lever <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> by a latch pin <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> inserted through aligned pivot holes <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> in the lever <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and a throughhole <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> in the latch <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. As a result, the number of components of the prior art latch assembly <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the size of the components and precision and complexity required during the assembly of those components into the operational latch assembly <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> provides significant problems during a mass production assembly and manufacturing process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, an improved latch assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to one embodiment of this invention is shown. The latch assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is likewise pivotally coupled to a mounting block <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of a workpiece <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by a lever pin <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> inserted through a pivot hole <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in the mounting block <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a hole <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the base of a lever <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> adapted to be aligned with the pivot hole <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in the block <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. As such, the latch assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of this invention is pivotally coupled to the workpiece <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The latch assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to one embodiment of this invention includes an integrally molded unitary latch <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The latch <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has a generally T-shaped configuration with a hook <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> formed on one end of a latch body <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. A grip <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is formed on the opposite end of the latch body <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> from the hook <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The latch <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> includes an elongate spring arm <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> which projects downwardly from the latch body <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The spring arm <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> includes an upper spring arm <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and a lower spring arm <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> joined together by an elbow <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. A terminal end of the spring arm is bifurcated to include a pair of spaced spring fingers <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> as shown particularly in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. A saddle notch <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is provided in the latch <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> at the juncture between the latch body <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the spring arm <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> A pair of pivot pins <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are integrally formed on the latch body <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, as shown particularly in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. One pivot pin <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is formed on each side of the latch body <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, has a generally cylindrical shape and is located at the terminal end of a flap <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> that is cantilevered to the latch body <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. A U-shaped opening <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> surrounds the flaps <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> on all but one side of the flaps <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The flap <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is flexible relative to the latch body <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> so that the pivot pins <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> can be temporarily deflected inwardly during assembly of the latch assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Nevertheless, the pivot pins <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are biased outwardly, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. Advantageously, the spring arm <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, latch body <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, hook <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, grip <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and pivot pins <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are integrally formed together for ease of assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the latch assembly and an overall reduction in the number of component parts required for assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The latch assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes the lever <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> which has a generally U-shaped cross-sectional configuration with a pair of flanges <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> which are mirror images of one another projecting from a spine <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the lever <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Each flange includes an upper lobe <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and a lower lobe <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> similar in this regard to the aesthetic and ergonomic aspects of the prior art latch assembly <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Each flange <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the lever <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> includes a pivot hole <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> in the upper lobe <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> to receive one of the pivot pins <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> on the latch <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Additionally, the lever <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> includes a pair of spaced pockets <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> at the lower end thereof, each of which is designed to receive therein one of the spring fingers <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the spring arm <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> on the latch <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Assembly of the latch <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to the lever <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> simply entails insertion of the terminal end of the spring arm <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> longitudinally into the lever <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> until each of the spring fingers <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is inserted into one of the pockets <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in the lever <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. As the spring fingers <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> become seated in the pockets <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, the pivot pins <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> on the latch body <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> temporarily deflect inwardly (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) and are guided into the respective pivot holes <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> by a lead-in ramp <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> formed in the lever <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> proximate each of the pivot holes <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. The simplified assembly procedure for the latch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> design according to this invention results in increased productivity and throughput during the manufacturing process due in large part to the reduced number of components and the ease with which those components are assembled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Once the latch <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is assembled with the lever <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the latch <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is biased toward the engaged position so that the hook <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> engages a catch <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> on the workpiece <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Nevertheless, a user may disengage the latch <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> from the catch <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and pivot the latch <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to the disengaged position by depressing the grip <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> until it contacts a socket <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> formed in the spine at the upper end of the lever <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The pivotal movement of the latch <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to and between the engaged and disengaged positions is limited during flexing of the spring arm <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> by a stop <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> projecting from the spine <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the lever <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to contact the saddle notch <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> at the juncture between the latch body <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the spring arm <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Therefore, as a result of the spring arm <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and interaction between the latch <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the lever <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the latch <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is biased into the engaged position as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Nevertheless, the latch <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may be pivoted about the pivot pins <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to flex the spring arm <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> into the disengaged position of the latch <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> as shown in dashed lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Once the grip <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is released by the user, the latch <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> will return to the engaged position as a result of the bias of the spring arm <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the interaction with the lever <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> It should be readily appreciated that although the pivot pins <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are shown as being integrally molded on the latch <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for receipt into pivot holes <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> in the lever <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the pivot pins may alternatively be integrally molded with the lever <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> for receipt into pivot holes in the latch <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to pivotally couple the latch <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and lever <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> together. Additionally, alternative designs for the spring arm <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> integrally molded with the latch <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can readily be envisioned within the scope of this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Nevertheless, the present invention does provide a simplified assembly procedure in an improved latch assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to thereby increase output and reduce the number of associated component parts and assembly procedures. Moreover, the aesthetics and ergonomics of the improved latch assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> complement those features of prior art latch designs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> From the above disclosure of the general principals of the present invention and the preceding detailed description of at least one preferred embodiment, those skilled in the art will readily comprehend the various modifications to which this invention is susceptible. Therefore, we desire to be limited only by the scope of the following claims and equivalents thereof. </paragraph>
