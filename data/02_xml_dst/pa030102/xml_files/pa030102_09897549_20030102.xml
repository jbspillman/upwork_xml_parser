<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A circuit board-washing device includes a pair of elongated upper and lower spraying casings located directly over and fixed relative to a tank, which contains a detergent that is forced into the casings. Each of the casings has a chamber and a horizontal wall, which is formed with two longitudinal rows of holes that are in fluid communication with the chamber. The walls of the casings define a washing space therebetween for movement of a horizontal circuit board therethrough in a transverse direction of the casings. The space is slightly wider than the board. The detergent is sprayed from the casings onto the board via the holes, and subsequently falls into the tank for recycle. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a circuit board-washing device, more particularly to a circuit board-washing device, which can spray a detergent evenly onto the top and bottom surfaces of a horizontal circuit board so as to minimize detergent residue on the circuit board. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> conventional circuit board-washing device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is shown to include a feeding roller unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> for feeding a horizontal circuit board <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a horizontal row of upper nozzles <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, a horizontal row of lower nozzles <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a pump <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, and a tank <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for containing a detergent. The roller unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of roller sets, each of which consists of a pair of upper and lower rollers for moving the board <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> therebetween. The detergent is forced by the pump <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to flow from the tank <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to the nozzles <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and is subsequently sprayed onto the top and bottom surfaces of the board <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, the detergent falls from the board <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> into the tank <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for recycle. Additional detergent will be supplemented automatically into the tank <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> as soon as the detergent level in the tank <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is lowered to a predetermined level. The aforesaid conventional washing device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> suffers from the following disadvantages: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The detergent cannot be distributed evenly onto the board <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. For example, the detergent accumulates on the areas of the board <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, to which the nozzles <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are directed, and cannot easily access other areas of the board <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, which are adjacent to the roller unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. As such, after washing, a substantial amount of detergent residue will remain on the top surface of the board <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> An object of this invention is to provide a circuit board-washing device, which can spray a detergent evenly on the top and bottom surfaces of a horizontal circuit board so as to minimize detergent residue on the circuit board. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> According to this invention, a circuit board-washing device includes a pair of elongated upper and lower spraying casings located directly over and fixed relative to a tank, which contains a detergent that is forced into the casings. Each of the casings has a chamber and a horizontal wall, which is formed with two longitudinal rows of holes that are in fluid communication with the chamber. The walls of the casings define a washing space therebetween for movement of a horizontal circuit board therethrough in a transverse direction of the casings. The space is slightly wider than the board. The detergent is sprayed from the casings onto the board via the holes, and subsequently falls into the tank for recycle. Each of the holes has a constant detergent flow rate according to the Bernoulli&apos;s theorem so that the detergent can be distributed evenly onto the board, thereby minimizing detergent residue on the board.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the preferred embodiment of a circuit board-washing device of this invention is shown to include two washing units <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> each consisting of a pair of elongated upper and lower spraying casings <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime;, a pump <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, a tank <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and a conveying roller unit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The casings <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime; are located directly over, and are fixed relative to the tank <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The lower spraying casings <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime; are disposed under the upper spraying casings <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Each of the casings <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime; has a chamber <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and an inlet unit consisting of two inlets <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>&prime; (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>) that are formed in two ends thereof and that are in fluid communication with the chamber <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. A detergent is contained within the tank <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and is forced by the pump <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to the inlets <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>&prime; in the casings <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime; via a conduit unit, which includes a plurality of conduits <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>&prime; (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). Additional detergent will be supplemented automatically into the tank <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> as soon as the detergent level in the tank <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is lowered to a predetermined level. The roller unit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is disposed outwardly of the casings <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime;, and is adapted to move a horizontal circuit board <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> between the casings <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime; in a transverse direction of the casings <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime;, which is indicated by an arrowhead (A) in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 3</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, each of the upper spraying casings <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> has a horizontal top surface <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> that is formed with an integral handle <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, and a horizontal bottom wall <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> that is formed with two longitudinal rows of closely spaced spraying holes <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, and two rows of guiding teeth <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> extending integrally, transversely and outwardly from two opposite longitudinal sides thereof. The lower spraying casings <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime; are symmetrical relative to the upper spraying casings <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. That is to say, each of the lower spraying casings <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime; has a horizontal bottom surface with a handle (not shown), and a horizontal top wall with two longitudinal rows of holes (not shown) and two rows of guiding teeth <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In each of the washing units <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the casings <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime; define a washing space <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> therebetween for passage of the board <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The spaces <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> are slightly wider than the board <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Each of the guiding teeth <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>&prime; of the upper and lower spraying casings <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime; has an outwardly and upwardly inclined guiding face <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight>&prime; (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). Accordingly, the board <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be guided into the washing spaces <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, the detergent can be guided to fall from the lower spraying casings <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime; via the guiding faces <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight>&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> According to Bernoulli&apos;s theorem, each of the holes <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> has a constant detergent flow rate. As such, the detergent can be distributed evenly onto the board <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, thereby minimizing detergent residue on the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> With this invention thus explained, it is apparent that numerous modifications and variations can be made without departing the scope and spirit of this invention. It is therefore intended that this invention be limited only as indicated by the appended claims. </paragraph>
