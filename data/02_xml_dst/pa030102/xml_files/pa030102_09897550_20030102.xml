<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a conducting roller for an electroplating apparatus, more particularly to a two-input type conducting roller which has two ends that accept simultaneously electric current so as to form a uniform-diameter metal coating on a circuit board. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> conventional electroplating apparatus is shown to include pairs of conducting rollers <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> disposed at upstream and downstream sides of an electroplating bath <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, which contains an electrolyte. A plurality of spray tubes <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and roller units <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> are provided inside the electroplating bath <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The spray tubes <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> not only function as anodes as they are connected electrically to a power source, but also spray an electrolyte onto a horizontal circuit board <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Each of the roller units <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of upper rollers <highlight><bold>931</bold></highlight> and a lower roller <highlight><bold>932</bold></highlight> to advance the board <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> through the electroplating bath <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The upper rollers <highlight><bold>932</bold></highlight> are arranged such that they will move downward by gravity to place the lowermost upper roller <highlight><bold>931</bold></highlight> in contact with the corresponding lower roller <highlight><bold>932</bold></highlight> as soon as the board <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> moves past the inlet <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> and outlet <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> of the electroplating bath <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, thereby sealing the inlet <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> and the outlet <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> and preventing the electrolyte from leaking and from staining the conducting rollers <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> provided outwardly of the electroplating bath <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows one conducting roller <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, which includes a rotatable conductive roller body <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> that presses against a side surface of the board <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), and a stationary conducting rod <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> that is inserted into a chamber <highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight> in a left end portion of the roller body <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. The chamber <highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight> has two ends <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight>, which are provided with a pair of bearing members <highlight><bold>714</bold></highlight>, on which the conducting rod <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is journalled. The roller body <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is rotated by means of a gear unit <highlight><bold>715</bold></highlight>. An annular seal <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> is sleeved on the conducting rod <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> so as to seal the chamber <highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight>. A conductive liquid <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is filled in the chamber <highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight> between the roller body <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and the conducting rod <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. As such, electric current can be transmitted from the conducting rod <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> to the roller body <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> via the conductive liquid <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. The disadvantages of the conducting roller <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> (1) A resistance loss is incurred on the roller body <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, and increases gradually from the left end to the right end in view of the condition that only a single cathode current input is provided to the left end of the roller body <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, thereby resulting in an uneven thickness of metal coating on the board <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> (2) The conductive liquid <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is normally made of mercury, which is highly poisonous, thereby resulting in serious environmental protection problems caused during filling and throwing-away thereof. Thus, it is desirable to reduce the amount of the conductive liquid <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> used in the roller body <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. However, because the conducting rod <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is relatively long, a substantial amount of the conductive liquid <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> needed to fill in the chamber <highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> An object of this invention is to provide a two-input type conducting roller for an electroplating apparatus, which has a constant voltage value at all of the axial positions thereof so as to maintain an even distribution of cathode current to an electrolyte, thereby forming effectively a uniform-diameter metal coating on a circuit board. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Another object of this invention is to provide a two-input type conducting roller for an electroplating apparatus, which needs only a small amount of conductive liquid to be used therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> According to this invention, a conducting roller is used in an electroplating apparatus, and includes a conductive roller body, which has two diameter-reduced end portions that are journalled within two stationary conductive sleeve units. A conductive liquid is filled within two sealed gaps between the end portions of the roller body and the sleeve units, thereby transmitting cathode current from the conducting sleeve units to the end portions of the roller body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Because cathode current is input simultaneously to the end portions of the roller body, the voltage value of the roller body is constant at all of the axial positions thereof such that a uniform-diameter of metal coating can be formed on a circuit board. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the sealed gaps are relatively small such that the amount of the conductive liquid required to be used in the conducting roller can be reduced.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, the preferred embodiment of a two-input conducting roller for an electroplating apparatus is shown to include a roller body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a driven gear unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a pair of conductive sleeve units <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and a pair of stationary conducting seats <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The conducting roller is horizontal, and has a left end supported on a support rod <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> that is disposed on a left stationary member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and a right end journalled on a right stationary member <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The roller body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has a uniform-diameter middle portion <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> in frictional contact with a top or bottom side surface of a horizontal circuit board (not shown) to be electroplated, two diameter-reduced end portions <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and two shoulders <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> that are defined between the middle portion <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and the end portions <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The driven gear unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> includes a horizontal connecting rod <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and a gear member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> that is formed with an integral horizontal rotating shaft <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>. The connecting rod <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is disposed within the right sleeve unit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and has a left end that is fixed within a hole <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in an end surface <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the right end portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the roller body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and a right end that is connected fixedly to the rotating shaft <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> of the gear member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. A driving gear <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is disposed rotatably on the right stationary member <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, and meshes with the gear member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> so as to rotate the gear member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the gear member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is positioned between the roller body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the right stationary member <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. The rotating shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> has a right end that is journalled on the right stationary member <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, and a left end surface that is formed with a hexagonal bore <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. The connecting rod <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> has a hexagonal cross-section, and engages fittingly the bore <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> in the rotating shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, thereby permitting synchronous rotation therewith. The right end portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the roller body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is formed with three radially extending threaded holes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> (only one is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>), which are angularly equidistant. Three lock bolts <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> (only one is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) engage the threaded holes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, respectively, and have radial inner ends <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> that press against the connecting rod <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, thereby locking the left end of the connecting rod <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> within the hole <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the right end portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the roller body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The sleeve units <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are disposed respectively on the end portions <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the roller body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Each of the sleeve units <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> consists of a conductive sleeve element <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and a conductive bushing <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, and is associated with a sealing unit, which includes two annular seals <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and two retaining rings <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, and two spacer rings <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. All of the seals <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the retaining rings <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and the spacer rings <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are sleeved on the end portions <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the roller body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The sleeve elements <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are connected respectively, fixedly, and electrically to the conducting seats <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Each of the bushings <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is disposed between the corresponding sleeve element <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the corresponding end portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the roller body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In each of the sleeve units <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the seals <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> press against two ends of the bushing <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> by means of the retaining rings <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, and are located on two sides of the bushing <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> so as to define a sealed annular gap between the sleeve element <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the end portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the roller body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and between the seals <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The sleeve elements <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are sleeved intimately on the bushings <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> for electrical connection therewith. A conductive liquid <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is filled within the sealed gaps between the sleeve elements <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the end portions <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the roller body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> so as to transmit cathode current from the conducting seats <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to the end portions <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the roller body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The spacer rings <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are disposed between the sleeve elements <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the shoulders <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> of the roller body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, thereby preventing contact between the shoulders <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and the sleeve elements <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The support rod <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is disposed rotatably on the left stationary member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and is coupled with the roller body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the left sleeve unit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in a manner, in which the connecting rod <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is connected to the roller body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the right sleeve unit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Each of the conducting seats <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> includes a vertical terminal pin <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, a horizontal fixing rod <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, and an L-shaped conducting plate <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. The terminal pins <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> are connected electrically to a negative side of a power supply (not shown) via an electric wire <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>. Each of the L-shaped conducting plate <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> has a vertical plate portion <highlight><bold>431</bold></highlight> that is fixed to and that is in electrical connection with the corresponding sleeve element <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and a horizontal plate portion <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight> that is formed integrally with an upper end of the vertical plate portion <highlight><bold>431</bold></highlight> and that is fixed to the terminal pin <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> for electrical connection therewith. The fixing rod <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> has one end that is connected fixedly to the conducting plate <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, and another end that is connected fixedly to the corresponding stationary member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, thereby fixing the conducting seats <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> relative to the stationary members <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Since the cathode current is input simultaneously to the left and right end portions <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the roller body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the roller body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has a constant voltage value at all of the axial positions thereof so as to distribute evenly the cathode current into an electrolyte in an electroplating bath (not shown), thereby forming a uniform-diameter metal coating on the circuit board (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, since the annular gaps between the sleeve units <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the roller body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are relatively short and thin, only a relatively small amount of conductive liquid is required to fill the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> With this invention thus explained, it is apparent that numerous modifications and variations can be made without departing the scope and spirit of this invention. It is therefore intended that this invention be limited only as indicated by the appended claims. </paragraph>
