<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a roller assembly for conveying a sheet-shaped workpiece in an electroplating apparatus, more particularly to a roller assembly, which is provided with at least one pair of guiding members for guiding the workpiece to move therebetween, thereby permitting accurate formation of a metal coating on target areas of the workpiece. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> conventional electroplating apparatus that is used in an automated manufacturing process of a printed circuit board is shown to include pairs of conducting rollers <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> disposed at upstream and downstream sides of an electroplating bath <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, which contains an electrolyte. A plurality of spray tubes <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and roller units <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> are provided inside the electroplating bath <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The spray tubes <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> not only function as anodes as they are connected electrically to a power source, but also spray an electrolyte onto a horizontal circuit board <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Each of the roller units <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of upper rollers <highlight><bold>931</bold></highlight> and a lower roller <highlight><bold>932</bold></highlight> to advance the board <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> through the electroplating bath <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The upper rollers <highlight><bold>932</bold></highlight> are arranged such that they will move downward by virtue of gravity to place the lowermost upper roller <highlight><bold>931</bold></highlight> in contact with the corresponding lower roller <highlight><bold>932</bold></highlight> as soon as the board <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> moves past the inlet <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> and outlet <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> of the electroplating bath <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, thereby sealing the inlet <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> and the outlet <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> and preventing the electrolyte from leaking and staining the conducting rollers <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> provided outwardly of the electroplating bath <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The disadvantages of the aforesaid electroplating apparatus are as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> (1) A photosensitive film is applied to a surface of the board <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> prior to electroplating. Hence, the surface of the board <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> has a film area to be electroplated, and a bare copper area for contact with the roller units <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight>. Because no guiding means is provided for guiding the bare copper area of the board <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to move in a direction that is perpendicular to the rollers <highlight><bold>931</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>932</bold></highlight>, the roller units <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> often press on the film area. As a result, it is difficult to form a desired circuit pattern on the board <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> (2) A resistance loss is incurred on the conducting roller <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, and increases gradually from one end to another end in view of the condition that only a single cathode current input is provided to one end of the conducting roller <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, thereby resulting in an uneven thickness of metal coating on the board <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> An object of this invention is to provide a roller assembly for an electroplating apparatus, which is provided with at least one pair of guiding members, the positions of which can be adjusted automatically according to the width of a sheet-shaped workpiece so as to guide the workpiece to move therebetween, thereby permitting accurate formation of a metal coating on target areas of the workpiece. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Another object of this invention is to provide a roller assembly for an electroplating apparatus, which can supply cathode current simultaneously to two opposite sides of a sheet-shaped workpiece, thereby forming a uniform-thickness of metal coating on the workpiece. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> According to this invention, a roller assembly for an electroplating apparatus includes a plurality of feeding rollers adapted to advance a sheet-shaped workpiece, and a threaded rod disposed parallel to the feeding rollers and having a left-hand thread portion and a right-hand thread portion. Two guiding members are respectively formed with two threaded holes, which engage the left-hand and right-hand thread portions of the rod. A sensing unit detects the width of the workpiece to activate a controller and a driving unit, which rotates the rod so as to move the guiding members in opposite directions such that the guiding members abut against two opposite sides of the workpiece, thereby guiding the workpiece to move therebetween. Two conducting units are attached respectively to the guiding members for supplying cathode current to the sides of the workpiece.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, the preferred embodiment of a roller assembly for an electroplating apparatus is shown to include a feeding mechanism <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and a conducting unit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The feeding mechanism <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of feeding rollers <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> adapted to feed a sheet-shaped workpiece, such as a horizontal circuit board <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a first threaded rod <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, a first driving unit consisting of a bevel gear set <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and a first servomotor <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, and a position sensing unit including a pair of sensors <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The feeding rollers <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the first threaded rod <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are parallel to one another, and are journalled on and between two frames <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The first feeding rollers <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> have fixed rotating shafts <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>, each of which is provided with a fixed sprocket <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> that is rotated by a chain unit <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>. The first threaded rod <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is formed with a left-hand thread portion <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> and a right-hand thread portion <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight>, which are symmetrical along a hypothetical middle line <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the board <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> that extends in a predetermined direction, in which the board <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> advances. Two first guiding members <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> have two threaded holes <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight>, which engage respectively and threadably the left-hand and right-hand thread portions <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> of the first threaded rod <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. As such, when the first threaded rod <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> rotates, the first guiding members <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> move in opposite directions. The sensors <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are attached to the first guiding members <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>, respectively, so as to detect the width of the board <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, thereby sending a signal to a controller <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, which is connected electrically to the first servomotor <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Subsequently, a motor shaft <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> of the first servomotor <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> rotates. The rotation of the motor shaft <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> will be transferred to the first threaded rod <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> by means of the bevel gear set <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> so as to move the first guiding members <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> in opposite directions until the distance between the first guiding members <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> is equal to the width of the board <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the first guiding members <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> abut respectively against two opposite sides of the board <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, thereby guiding the board <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to move therebetween in the predetermined direction. The conducting mechanism <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> includes two lower rollers <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, a second threaded rod <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, and a second driving unit consisting of a bevel gear set <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and a second servomotor <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. The lower rollers <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are disposed at the same level as the feeding rollers <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and have a pair of fixed rotating shafts <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>, each of which is provided with a fixed sprocket <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> that is driven by the chain unit <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>. The rotating shafts <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> are journalled between and on two frames <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Each of the lower rollers <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is associated with an upper roller <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> so as to move the board <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> therebetween. The second threaded rod <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is similar to the first threaded rod <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> in construction, and has a left-hand thread portion <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight> and a right-hand thread portion <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight>, which engage two second guiding members <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>. Two conducting units are attached respectively to the second guiding members <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, each of the conducting units includes two conducting rollers <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, which are disposed between the lower rollers <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and which are arranged one above another. The second servomotor <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is coupled to the second threaded rod <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> by means of the bevel gear set <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and has a motor shaft <highlight><bold>351</bold></highlight> that is aligned with the shaft <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> of the first servomotor <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and that is perpendicular to the feeding rollers <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Because the first and second servomotors <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are connected to the controller <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, they can be activated simultaneously, thereby permitting synchronous rotation of the first and second threaded rods <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, each of the conducting rollers <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> includes a conductive ring <highlight><bold>361</bold></highlight>, an annular conducting seat <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight>, a conductive bushing <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight>, two annular seals <highlight><bold>367</bold></highlight>, two retaining rings <highlight><bold>368</bold></highlight>, and a terminal pin <highlight><bold>369</bold></highlight>. Only one of the conducting rollers <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is described in the succeeding paragraph. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The conductive ring <highlight><bold>361</bold></highlight> and the conductive bushing <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> are interconnected fixedly, and are sleeved movably on a roller shaft <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>&prime;, which is journalled on the frames <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The conducting seat <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> is disposed around the bushing <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight>, and is fixed on the corresponding second guiding member <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>. As such, when the second threaded rod <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> rotates to move the second guiding members <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> thereon, the conductive ring <highlight><bold>361</bold></highlight> and the conductive bushing <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> move on the roller shaft <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>&prime;. The annular seals <highlight><bold>367</bold></highlight> are sleeved fixedly on the roller shaft <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>&prime; by means of the retaining rings <highlight><bold>368</bold></highlight> so as to define a sealed annular gap between the conducting seat <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> and the conductive bushing <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> and between the seals <highlight><bold>367</bold></highlight>, within which a conductive liquid <highlight><bold>366</bold></highlight> is filled. Accordingly, an electrical connection is established between the conducting seat <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> and the conductive bushing <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight>. The terminal pin <highlight><bold>369</bold></highlight> is fixed to the conducting seat <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> for electrical connection therewith, and is adapted to be connected to a negative side of a power supply (not shown), thereby transmitting cathode current from the terminal pin <highlight><bold>369</bold></highlight> to the conductive ring <highlight><bold>361</bold></highlight> via the conductive liquid <highlight><bold>366</bold></highlight> and the conductive bushing <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight>. The conductive ring <highlight><bold>361</bold></highlight> has an outer periphery that is formed with a contact portion <highlight><bold>363</bold></highlight> for electrical contact with a peripheral bare copper area <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) of the board <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which surrounds a film area (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the positions of the first and second guiding members <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> can be adjusted automatically according to the width of the board <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> so as to guide the latter to move therebetween, thereby permitting accurate formation of a metal coating on the board <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the conducting rollers <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> can supply cathode current simultaneously to two opposite sides of the board <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, thereby forming a uniform-thickness of metal coating on the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> With this invention thus explained, it is apparent that numerous modifications and variations can be made without departing the scope and spirit of this invention. It is therefore intended that this invention be limited only as indicated by the appended claims. </paragraph>
