<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a back pain relieving device, and more particularly to a back pain relieving device for use on either a vehicle seat or any other seat having a back support, or by a person in a supine position. </paragraph>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Back pain is a common complaint for a large number of people. In order to minimize back pain, various devices are known to have been developed. Such devices provide some relief. However, it is difficult to obtain a device that provides an adequate and a safe relief from back pain for a person, while that person is driving a vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Some of the devices for relief of back pain, while the person suffering from the back pain is a rider in or a driver for a vehicle, are too hard and become dangerous in case of an accident. Other devices are not flexible and interfere with the positioning and driving of, or riding in, a vehicle. Thus, it is desired to avoid these difficulties and provide access either to back comfort or reduced back pain, while at the same time minimizing interference with any use of a vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Also, it is difficult to remove and reinstall a back support device from the vehicle to the house or back. It is also difficult to use the same back support device for the vehicle or the house. It is desired to have a back pain relieving device that accomplishes use or permits the use thereof in both a vehicle or a house. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, among the back pain relieving devices of the prior art, it is common for the device to cause a skin injury. It is difficult to provide the device, which can provide the necessary massage, while at the same time, avoids the damage to the skin. The device must be hard enough to provide the pain relief, while at the same time, avoiding damage to the skin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Thus, a solution for the goal of pain relief can result in skin injury. A solution for the goal of avoiding skin injury reduces pain relief. It is very desirable to maximize the advantages of both situations. No device currently exists to meet those goals. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> This particular invention relates to a back pain relieving device. The back pain relieving device has a center strap or linear alignment support. To the center strap are secured a number of implements or double pads. Each implement has a connection device permitting it to be fastened to the center strap. Preferably, the connection device is centrally located on the implement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Likewise, on the linear alignment device are pad supports adapted to receive the double pads. A variety of pad supports may be used in this matter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> On either side of the strap, protruding from the connection device on the implements are relatively comfortable enlargements, which combine to form the double pad. These double pads are preferably of a flexible material with a durometer, or hardness, similar to that of skin. While it not desired to be bound by any particular theory, the shape of the double pads combined with the size, positioning, and durometer; the back pain relieving device accomplishes the desired comfort or pain relief for an average person&apos;s back. It believed that the back pain relieving will be effective for most, but not all, people. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In this fashion, these double pads permit the back to be comfortable and provide for comfort while riding in a vehicle, or sitting in a chair at home or anywhere. With these devices increasing in size as they move up the back or down the back, great comfort is obtained. Also, the back pain relieving device or device is provided in the back of the person using the device is rendered more comfortably whether sitting in a vehicle or sitting in a chair. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In a preferred form, on the linear alignment support, the double pads are similar in shape, but different in size. The double pads have a graduated size from the top of linear alignment support, with the largest double pad being at or near the top thereof, and the smallest double pad being at or near the bottom thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Also, in a preferred form, on the linear alignment support, one to eight double pads are used. More preferably, on the linear alignment support, two to six double pads are used. Most preferably, on the linear alignment support, three to five double pads are used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> All or none or mixtures of the double pads may have knobs on the top of the pads, as applied to the linear alignment strap. A mixture is preferred, because such a variation in the double pads empirically appears to provide better relief. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Each double pad preferably has two convex sections and a connecting device, each convex section being on opposing sides of the connecting device. These double pads are preferably of a convex flexible material with a durometer, or hardness, similar to that of skin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The convex flexible pads on either side of the connecting device may have any type of perimeter at the convex edge. Such perimeter may be circular, rectangular, square or polygonal as desired. Preferably, the shape of the perimeter is substantially rectangular with rounded corners. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the back pain relieving device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of this invention is depicted as positioned on headrest <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> of vehicle seat <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, by means of mounting line <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. The back <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of person <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is assisted by back pain relieving device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. A series of double pads <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> contact opposing sides <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> of the spine <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, thereby providing comfort to person <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Adding <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>; to consideration, a series of double pads <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> are connected to the alignment ladder <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. Alignment ladder <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> receives and supports as many of double pad <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> as desired. Alignment ladder <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> has a mounting line <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> attached at the top <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Each double pad <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> has a flat central portion <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> with a first convex pad <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and a second convex pad <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> on either side thereof. For each double pad <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, first convex pad <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and second convex pad <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> are substantially mirror images of each other. The first convex pad <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and the second convex pad <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> are generally hemispherical in shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> If desired, the first convex pad <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and the second convex pad <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> may have a raised knob surface in that a plurality of raised knobs <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may be on the outer portion <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> thereof. The raised knobs <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> are preferably set up in a generally square pattern <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. That choice depends on personal preference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> A smooth surface <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> may also be used alone if desired. Combinations of raised knobs <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and smooth surface <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> may also be used, and generally preferred to either raised knobs <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and smooth surface <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> alone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> On each alignment ladder <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, the series of double pads <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> have different perimeters <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> for the first convex pad <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and the second-convex pad <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. Preferably, diameters or perimeters <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> for double pads <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> increase as double pads <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> move up the alignment ladder <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> As a preferred mounting device for securing double pads <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to alignment ladder <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, the substantially flat central portion <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> has a raised button <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> thereon oppositely disposed from outer portion <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. Raised button <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> fits through ladder aperture <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> in alignment ladder <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> in a male to female relationship. With the alignment ladder <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> having series of ladder apertures <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, any number of double pads <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> may be secured to alignment ladder <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, as long as there is a ladder aperture <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, therefor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Clearly, raised button <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> fitting through ladder aperture <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> in alignment ladder <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> permits double pad <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to be releasably attached to the alignment ladder <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. Each double pad <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> may have a change in position, as well as providing for increased or decreased numbers of double pads <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, on alignment ladder <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Alignment ladder <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is preferably an elongated flat strip of flexible material. Ladder apertures <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> are preferably centrally located therein between the strap sides <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> thereof, and equally spaced along the length <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> While the particular male to female relationship of the double pads <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to alignment ladder <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is preferred for ease of manufacture, it is clearly reversible, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. Alignment ladder <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is replaced with button strap <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> used in button strap back pain relieving device <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Button strap <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> has a series of strap buttons <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> thereon. Double pad <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> has raised button <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> being replaced with pad aperture <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. The pad aperture <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> may receive a strap button <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, and provide a structure of back pain relieving device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> similar that of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, unitary back pain relieving device <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> has central strap <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> with molded pads <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> thereon. Molded pads <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> are permanently attached to central strap <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>, because they are part of the molding process. Preferably the molded pads <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> are similar in size and shape to double pads <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. However, molded pads <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight>, while similar in shape to double pad <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the positioning is fixed and not adjustable relative to central strap <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The back pain relieving device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is believed to be more flexible and more useful, and thus more preferred than unitary back pain relieving device <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. For example, double pads <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> are more easily repositioned on alignment ladder <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> With <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the stored position <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> of pain relieving device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> with double pads <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> on alignment ladder <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. Due to the flexibility of alignment ladder <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and, to a lesser extent, the flexibility of double pads <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, pain relieving device may be rolled up into stored position <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>. In stored position <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, pain relieving <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be placed, for example, in a glove compartment of a vehicle (not shown) until use thereof is desired. Similar storage features are available for button strap back pain relieving device <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> or unitary back pain relieving device <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> as desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> This application&mdash;taken as a whole with the specification, claims, abstract, and drawings&mdash;provides sufficient information for a person having ordinary skill in the art to practice the invention disclosed and claimed herein. Any measures necessary to practice this invention are well within the skill of a person having ordinary skill in this art after that person has made a careful study of this disclosure. </paragraph>
