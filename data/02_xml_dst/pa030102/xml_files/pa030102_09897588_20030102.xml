<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention pertains to the packaging of food products, and more particularly to food product packaging which aids in dispersing, on demand, a solid food component, such as a cheese sauce, onto a second food component such as vegetable chips, crisps, or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A wide variety of dips and sauces has been provided to complement food products such as tortilla chips, potato chips and crisps, for example. The complementary sauces and dips may be served at a variety of temperatures ranging from refrigerated temperatures to much hotter, elevated temperatures. Typically, when served at elevated temperatures, the sauce or dip is removed from a container and placed in a cooking vessel or dish for heating. Advances in packaging and serving are continually being sought. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A problem associated with multi-component food products of the type described above, in addition to the extra steps and use of dishes associated with separate heating, is the uneven dispersion of one food component over the other. For example, while a cheese sauce may be served in a cup, for use as a dip, it is becoming increasingly popular to pour a melted cheese sauce over a pile of food chips. Care must be taken to drizzle or otherwise pour the cheese sauce evenly across the mound of chips. Too often cheese sauce is concentrated in a localized position of the mounded pile of food chips. Improvements in dispersion and a reduction in the amount of attention paid to dispersion techniques is being sought. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the invention to provide a multi-component food product in which a first solid food component is converted into liquid form for use with a second food component such as food chips or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide a packaging for food products of the above type which are suitable for use in microwave ovens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Yet another object of the present invention is to provide automatic or unattended even dispersion of the liquified food product onto a second food component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A further object of the present invention is to provide packaging of the type described above suitable for use in mass production assembly operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Yet another object of the present invention is to provide food packaging of the above-described type which is suitable for use with high volume gas flushing operations carried out immediately prior to sealing of the package, so as to preserve the freshness of the food components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> These and other objects of the present invention are provided in a combination of a food product and package, assembled for transport to a remote location, which comprises a bowl that has a side wall and a bottom wall which cooperate to define an interior cavity, and an upper end. A cap or lid dimensioned to close the upper end of the bowl has a central cup-like depression that receives the second food component in a solid cake form. The central portion of the lid includes a plurality of protrusions which extend into the second food product component. The cap includes a pair of diametrically opposed fluted portions disposed on either side of the central portion. The bowl defines a pair of diametrically opposed fluted portions complementarity shaped with the fluted portions of the cap so that the cap and bowl nest interfitting with the cap in both shipping and heating inverted positions. The cap in the heating position presents protrusions downwardly which extend toward the bowl interior with the outer surfaces of the protrusions guiding the second food product component for uniform distribution about the interior of the bowl.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Turning now to the drawings, a package for a food product is generally indicated at <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a cap <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a cup or bowl <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Cap <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is moveable between a storage position illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and a cooking or heating position illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Cap <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and bowl <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are preferably made of plastic materials suitable for heating in a microwave oven and, like bowl <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, cap <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is preferably made of a single integral molded construction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, bowl <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> includes a side wall <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and a bottom wall <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> having a central raised portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> forming an outer annular recessed portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows bowl <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> filled with a first food product component <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in the form of a relatively rigid tortilla chips <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The food product component <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> could also comprise any of a number of farinaceous foods which include, for example, grain and cereal products, such as soft and hard breads and crackers as well as vegetable products such as vegetable chips, including chips made of potato or corn. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Food product component <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> preferably has a thin, rigid or semi-rigid form, but may also be soft and pliable. The outer annular recess <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> provides a convenient collection point for a second food product component <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> carried in cap <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the manner shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. As will be explained herein, cap <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is inverted by a consumer to the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 6</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and subjected to elevated temperatures which cause the second food product component <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to disperse onto the first food product component <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Any excess second food product component <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> not retained by the first product <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is collected in the portions of the outer annular recesses <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to allow a consumer to scrape second food product component from the bottom of bowl <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, bowl <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> includes a recessed rim <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> having an outwardly extending flange <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> with an upper surface <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) for conveniently receiving a sealing film <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> made for example of plastic or aluminum foil. Sealing film <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> cooperates with bowl <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to completely enclose food products <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> as well as the entire portion of cap <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the interior of bowl <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. If desired, sealing film <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> could be replaced with other packaging components known in the art to cooperate with bowl <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to seal the contents thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is configured for shipment, whereas <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 6</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> show package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> configured for heating which releases the second food component <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> for contact with the first food component <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>. Cap <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has a first side illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> with a central recess portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. A plurality of separate spaced apart protrusions <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> extend above an end wall <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> as can be seen for example in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. End wall <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is joined to a frustoconical side wall <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> so as to receive support from a truncated circular outer wall portion <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The truncations in wall portion <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> form segment shaped openings <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>). In this manner, cost effective conventional mass production gas-flushing techniques can be applied to package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> immediately prior to the application of sealing film <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The gas-flushing may be employed, for example, to preserve the freshness, crispness, flavor and other desirable perishable qualities of the food components <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In the storage position illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the outer wall portion is nested within recess <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and is generally coextensive with the outer marginal portion <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of bowl <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The nested arrangement provides a stable well-sealed arrangement for the readily application of sealing film <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The application of sealing film <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, as with the filling of food product components <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the assembly of cap and bowl portions, is well suited for high speed mass production techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, cap <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> includes a pair of diametrically opposed fluted portions <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> having first narrower parts <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and second, wider parts <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Bowl <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has diametrically opposed fluted portions <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> generally coextensive with the fluted portions <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of cap <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The fluted portions <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of bowl <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> include first narrower parts <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and second wider parts <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> fluted portions <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of cap <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and bowl <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> nest within one another with the narrow parts <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>adjacent one another and the wider parts <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>adjacent one another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, with cap <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the inverted, heating position, the openings <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> and the cooperating fluted portions of cap <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and bowl <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> provide passageways for the escape of steam through exit openings <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, end wall <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and trapezoidal side wall <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> form a cup portion which, when inverted in the manner shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, for example, can conveniently receive a liquified second food component <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the second food component <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is allowed to harden to form a cake contained within end wall <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and side wall <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, being interrupted by protrusions <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Preferably, as indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, second food component <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is filled slightly above the free ends of projections <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, for example, projections <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> include a central protrusion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> surrounded by a plurality of equally spaced protrusions arranged in a circular pattern. Other arrangements of protrusions, and arrangements including differing number of protrusions are also contemplated by the present invention. As illustrated in the enlarged cross-sectional view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, projections <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are preferably continuously rounded and include a rounded free end. In a preferred embodiment, the rounded free end of projection <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is generally hemispherical in shape, although other shapes could be employed, as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In use, a consumer removes the film seal <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> or other conventional seal for bowl <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, exposing the cake of second food component <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. If desired, the cake of second food product component <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> could be separately sealed with a peel seal of appropriate material such as plastic film or aluminum foil and an outer flat band <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>) is made available for this purpose. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the application of seal <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to the upper end of package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, in the manner indicated can be readily accomplished using conventional equipment and mass production assembly techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Upon removing the seal <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, the user accesses cap <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, inverting the cap to the position indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 6</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> with the cake of second food product <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> facing in a downward direction, into the interior of bowl <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The cake is then subjected to conditions which cause the second food product to take on a liquified form. Preferably, the cake <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is heated, causing it&apos;s outer surface to become liquified and drip onto the first food product component <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in the manner indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>. The protrusions <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> guide the liquified second food product component in a desired dispersion pattern, insuring a uniform coating of the first food product component <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> about the second food product component <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The protrusions <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, in cooperation with other features of the illustrated embodiment, have been found to satisfactorily distribute the second food product component in a uniform manner across the interior of bowl <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and have further been found to release the substantial entirety of the second food product component in the desired manner. As an important feature, a single release of the entire second food product component into the interior of bowl <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> It is believed that retention of the cake of the second food product component during heating is facilitated by surface tension of the product with the protrusions formed by the hollow interior of protrusions <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, visible for example in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. It is generally preferred, for this reason, and for reasons of economical plastic molding that the protrusions <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> be made hollow in the manner illustrated. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, for example, the hollow cavities <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of protrusions <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> could be conveniently filled with a cooling medium such as ice water or could be made solid, to provide a thermal heat sink mass, although such has been found to be unnecessary. In addition to the thermal functioning of cap <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> during heating, the number and relatively close spacing of protrusions <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, as well as their relative proportions shown for example in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> are believed to contribute to the controlled release of second food product <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment, as mentioned, first food product component <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> comprises vegetable chips, and most preferably tortilla chips. Also, in the preferred embodiment second food product component <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> comprises a cheese sauce having the following characteristic properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> It is generally preferred that the second food product component be semi-viscous during manufacturing so as to be compatible with mass production filling and assembling techniques. As mentioned, it is generally preferred that the package configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> be assembled in high speed production environment, allowing assembly and filling of both food product components immediately prior to application of sealing film <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, further advantages of the present invention can be realized with the separate assembly of cap <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and second food product component <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. For example, the second food product component can be filled in a liquified or semi-viscous state caused for example by heating the second food product component. Caps can be filled in a high speed production environment and introduced into a refrigerated or cooling environment to promote rapid solidification of the second food product component, rendering the assembly less sensitive to non-refrigerated mass production assembly techniques employed to produce package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment, the second food product component <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> forms a cake approximately 3&Prime; in diameter and approximately 0.6&Prime; in height. The protrusions <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> have a maximum diameter of approximately 0.44&Prime; and a height or axial length slightly less than the 0.6&Prime; thickness of cake <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> As mentioned, aspects of the preferred embodiment provides packaging for the combination of a cheese sauce and a tortilla chip component, although other combinations of secondary and primary food components can receive the benefits of food package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the assembly and filling techniques employed therewith. For purposes of suggestion, but not limitation, the secondary/primary food component compositions can comprise: cheese sauce over nacho chips, cheese sauce over pretzels, chocolate sauce over one or more brownie cookies, cinnamon frosting over one or more rolls or other bread products, salsa sauce over nacho chips and cheese sauce over popcorn. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference>, an alternative embodiment of a food package is indicated at <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> shows food package <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> being readied for shipment to a consumer. A plastic overwrap <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is applied to the upper end of the food package and is sealed to the flange <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of cup or bowl <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The cap <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of food package <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> has a generally continuous circular outer periphery and covers substantially the entire circular opening defined by flange <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Food package <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is substantially identical to the food package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, described above, except that cap <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> provides a continuous cover for the upper end for bowl <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
