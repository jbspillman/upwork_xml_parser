<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">Plastic shopping bags having attached promotional ad strips and apparatus and methods for making them are described. The plastic bags have front and back walls and heat sealed bottom and side seams. In several variations the bags have gusseted side edges and the ad strip are attached within the gussets or above the gussets either by heat sealing one end of the strip to the bottom seal and otherwise adhering the other end of the strip at the upper end of the bag or adhering the strip to the bag at both ends. In non-gusseted bags, the strips are either heat sealed at one end to the bottom seal and otherwise adhered to the upper end of the bag or the strips are adhered at both ends to the upper and lower portion of the front or rear surfaces of the bag. In gusseted T-shirt type handle bags, where the ad strip are heat sealed into both the upper and lower seams of the bag, either inside or outside of the gusset, the intermediate portion of the ad strip is adhered to either the inside or the outside of the gusset of the bag to better control movement of the strip with respect to the bag. The strips are adhered to the bags using glue spotting, cold adhesion or similar methods. The bags are formed from continuous lengths of plastic tubing that is gusseted, heat sealed and cut to length with the ad strips attached as part of the process. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to the field of plastic bags of the type employed by retailers in packing food items and other merchandise, with particular application to bags that are unsealed or partially sealed along their top edges. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In our prior U.S. Pat. No. 5,882,118 and its divisional method U.S. Pat. No. 6,068,584, we disclosed and claimed the attachment of advertising strips to T-shirt bags and a method for accomplishing such attachments during the course of fabricating such bags from extruded plastic tubing. Because the bags disclosed in our prior patent were heat-sealed along both their bottom and top edges, it was possible simultaneously to heat seal the ends of advertising strips to be attached to the bag along both the top and lower edges of such strips. These strips could be disposed either within the gussets of the bags or along an outside edge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Attachment of advertising strips in the manner disclosed in our prior patents, however, cannot be accomplished where the top edges of the bag, such as those sometimes referred to as handle bags, flat bags and merchandise bags are left open at their top edges in order to enable merchandise to be placed in the bag. One type of such bags may have a central handle in contrast to the side handles of the T-shirt bags. When such open top edge bags are being produced, it is not possible to drop heating elements on each side of the cutting blade, transversely along the bag&apos;s division line and simultaneously heat seal the bottom of one bag and the top of the adjacent bag with the upper end of the advertising strip since the top edges of each bag must remain open. If it is, therefore, desired to provide open top edge bags with advertising strips, it is necessary to find some means and/or method for attaching the upper end of the advertising strip to the sides of one or both of the bag walls. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> When advertising strips are attached to shopping bags there is sometimes a problem of movement of the strips with respect to the bags when the strips are secured only at the strip ends. For this reason it is necessary to develop methods for securing the strip to the bag walls between the strip ends. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A plastic shopping bag with promotional strip ad may be formed from the following components.
