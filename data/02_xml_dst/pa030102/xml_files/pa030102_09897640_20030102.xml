<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to battery assemblies and, in particular, to battery assemblies having a rechargeable battery and a battery charger. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Battery assemblies in which a rechargeable battery is incorporated with a battery charger are known in the art. U.S. Pat. No. 5,510,694 discloses one battery assembly of this type in which a charging unit is used in conjunction with a rechargeable battery. In this battery assembly, the charging unit is seated on and covers the entire top surface of the battery including the positive and negative battery terminals. Accordingly, the charging unit itself must be provided with positive and negative terminals for withdrawing energy from the battery assembly. The need for terminals on the charging unit requires additional hardware and connections, all of which increases the cost and complexity of the battery assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Also, in the configuration in which the battery charger and battery are designed as separate units, the charger is connected to the battery using a snap lock connection. In particular, mating mechanical connectors are provided on the sides of the battery and charger. These mating connectors are releasable, thereby permitting the charger and battery to be disconnected after they have been connected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The ability to disconnect the charger from the battery permits the charger to be easily separated from the battery and increases the likelihood that the charger may be misplaced. In such circumstances, an unsophisticated user may attempt to use a different charger to charge the battery. Since different battery chemistries, e.g. lead acid and nickel zinc, require different charging characteristics, the use of a different charger could seriously damage the battery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a battery assembly comprised of a rechargeable battery and a separate battery charging unit which overcomes the above disadvantages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is also an object of the present invention to provide a battery assembly comprised of a rechargeable battery and a separate battery charging unit in which the battery terminals of the battery are those accessible for external connection to the battery assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is a further object of the present invention to provide a battery assembly comprised of a rechargeable battery and a separate battery charging unit in which connection of the battery and charger is such as to prevent separation of the battery and charger once connected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is yet a further object of the present invention to provide a battery assembly comprised of a rechargeable battery and a separate battery charging unit in which the the terminal pieces used with the battery assembly are designed to facilitate ease of use of the battery assembly by the user. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the principles of the present invention, the above and other objectives are realized in a battery assembly comprised of a rechargeable battery and a separate battery charging unit in which the battery charging unit includes a battery charger which is affixed to a cover, the latter being locked to the rechargeable battery by a locking assembly. The rechargeable battery has an outer surface and positive and negative terminals extending from the outer surface and the cover is designed to cover a portion of the outer surface of the battery exclusive of the positive and negative terminals. The latter terminals are thus not obstructed by the charging unit and are, accordingly, accessible for external connection to the battery assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In a further aspect of the invention, the locking assembly is configured to be unlockable once locked. The charging unit is thus permanently affixed to the rechargeable battery, thereby reducing the risk of charging the battery with a charger not suitably adapted to the battery chemistry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In yet another aspect of the invention, the terminal pieces which are used to hold external leads to the positive and negative terminals of the rechargeable battery are themselves secured to the battery assembly by securing members which maintain the terminal pieces secured to the battery when the pieces are disengaged from the positive and negative terminals. This prevents loss of the terminal pieces and facilitates use of the battery assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> More particularly, each terminal piece is provided with a circumferential groove and each securing member comprises a strap having an end with an aperture for receiving the corresponding terminal piece and for engaging with the groove in the piece to rotatably hold the piece. The other end of the strap is adapted to be secured to the battery assembly. This is accomplished by use of the locking assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In an additional aspect of the invention, each terminal piece comprises a wing nut with a circumferential groove. Each wing nut is also color coded so as to differentiate the wing nut for the positive terminal from the wing nut for the negative terminal.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows an isometric view and FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> show front, back, top and side views of a battery assembly <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in accordance with the principles of the present invention. As shown, the battery assembly <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> comprises a rechargeable battery <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and a separately formed battery charging unit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The battery <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the present embodiment is illustrated as a nickel zinc battery and the charging unit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has charging characteristics specifically adapted to charging a battery with nickel-zinc chemistry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The rechargeable battery <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has an outer casing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> with flat front and back walls <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and opposing right and left side walls <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Protruding from each side wall <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are intersecting horizontal and vertical ribs <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Also, extending form the upper end of each of the side walls <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are flange areas <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, respectively, and from the upper edge of the front an back walls flange areas <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> An upstanding ridge <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) is situated inward of the flange areas <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and extends around the entire periphery of the casing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. A top member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> seats over this ridge member to close the top of the casing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Partitions <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> divide the casing into cell compartments each of which houses interleaved positive and negative battery electrodes <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. Tabs <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in combination with through-the-wall connectors <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> (not visible) connect the electrodes in the cell compartments electrically in series and to negative and positive terminal posts <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> (see, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>). The terminal posts positive <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are situated at diametrically opposite corners of the casing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and extend through apertures <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> in the upper surface <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of the battery assembly <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The latter surface <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is formed by the upper surface of the top member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and the terminals <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are the terminals to be used by a user to extract energy from the battery assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the principles of the present invention, the charging unit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is configured to allow the battery terminals <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to be accessible for such energy extraction. In particular, the charging unit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> comprises a cover <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> which is designed to cover the surface <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of the battery <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> exclusive of the battery terminals <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> As shown, the cover <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> comprises front and rear walls <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and right and left side walls <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. Each of these walls has a lower vertical section and an upper inwardly tapered section. The tapered sections of the walls <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> terminate at a flat upper wall <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the cover. The cover <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> thus has a truncated pyramid shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The lower ends of the vertical sections of the front and rear walls <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> fit over the top member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and abut the flange areas <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the front and rear walls of the casing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The lower ends of the right and left side walls <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> also fit over the top member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the casing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and are provided at their lower edges with respective flanges areas <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> which abut the flange areas <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of the right and left side walls of the casing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> To allow for passage of the battery terminals <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the tapered sections of the walls <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> are provided with recessed areas <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> overlying the diametrically opposed areas of the top surface <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of the casing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> having the apertures <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. The recessed areas in their lower walls abutting the surface <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are likewise also provided with apertures <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, respectively, to permit passage of the battery terminals <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Accessibility of the terminals to external connecting leads for extracting energy from the battery assembly <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is thus assured, while the separately formed battery charging unit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is supported to overly the top surface of the battery <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The charger <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of the charging unit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is supported in an upper chamber formed by a rectangular wall <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> extending downwardly from the inner surface <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> of the upper wall <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the cover <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. Leads <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> carry the direct current output of the charger <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> to the battery terminals <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. A further lead <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>, passing through an aperture <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> in the upper wall <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, is connected to the charger and permits via a three prong connector <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> alternating current to be supplied from an external source to the charger. The charger <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> may be secured in place in the chamber by a suitable potting material and is of conventional design adapted to the battery chemistry of the battery <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, which in the present illustrative case is a nickel-zinc battery chemistry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> For cooling the charger <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, the charging unit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is further provided with a cooling member <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> which is secured to and supported above and the charger. The cooling member <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> also extends through a further aperture <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> in the upper wall <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the cover <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> to allow heat to escape from the member to outside air. The cooling member can be formed to have a plurality of longitudinal fins to promote cooling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In further accordance with the invention, in order to connect the battery <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the separately formed charging unit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> together in a such a way as to prevent separation and possible misplacement of the charging unit, an unlockable locking assembly <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> (see, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) is used. More particularly, the units are locked together by a locking assembly in the form of a snap in lock which engages and holds the assembly together at the abutting flanges of the side walls of the casing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the cover <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> To this end, the flanges <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of the side walls <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> are provided with through slots <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> at spaced positions along their length. In the present case, two through slots <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> at opposite ends of each flange are provided. The flanges <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of the side walls <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are, in turn, provided with apertures <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> which extend through the thickness of the flanges and which are aligned with through slots <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> in the flanges <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. The apertures <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> have a outward step at their lower ends to form an abutment <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> To lock the battery <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and charger <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> together, a locking pin <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> is inserted through each pair of the aligned slot <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and aperture <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, each locking pin <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> has an enlarged head <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> followed by a cylindrical shaft <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> which terminates in a outward shoulder <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> which tapers inwardly to the terminal end of the pin. When inserted into an aligned slot <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and aperture <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>, the shoulder <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> of the pin is pushed past the step or abutment <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> of the aperture <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>. Once past the abutment <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, the pin <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> snaps in place, with the head <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> of the pin <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> engaging the top surface of the slot <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and the shoulder <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> of the pin engaging the abutment <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Insertion of the pins <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> thus locks the pins and the flanges in place, thereby locking the battery <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and charger <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> together. Moreover, the pins <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> cannot be withdrawn unless they are tampered with and modified so that they no longer can provide the necessary locking function. Accordingly, they in cooperation with the slots <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and apertures <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> provide the unlockable locking assembly <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>. In order to further lock the charger and battery together, a glue can be placed around the entire peripheries of the mating flanges of the walls of the casing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the cover <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In a further aspect of the invention, the battery assembly <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is provided with terminal pieces <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> which facilitate use of the battery and connection of battery to external leads. More particularly, the terminal pieces are adapted both to engage the battery terminals and to remain connected to the battery assembly <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> when not engaged with the terminals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In the present case, each terminal piece <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> is by a securing member in the form of a strap <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight>. A circumferential groove <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> in the piece <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> is seated in one end of the strap <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> so that the piece <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> is rotatable. The other end <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> of the strap <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> is held by the battery assembly <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> via the pin <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>. When each terminal piece <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> is thus disengaged from its respective terminal of the battery <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the piece remains securely held to the battery assembly via it associated strap <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows the strap <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> in greater detail. The end <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> of the strap includes an enlarged aperture <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and the end <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> includes a smaller aperture <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight>. In use, the terminal piece <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> is urged through the aperture <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> until the groove <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> reaches the aperture <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>. At this position, the piece <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> becomes rotatably held through engagement of the areas of the strap adjacent the aperture <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and the walls of the groove <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The smaller aperture <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> of the strap <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> is, in turn, adapted to be of sufficient diameter to pass the shoulder <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> and the shaft <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> of the pin <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>. This permits the aperture <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> of the strap to be placed in alignment with a respective slot <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and to allow passage of the pin <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> therethrough as the pin <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> is being inserted in the slot and the underlying aperture <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>. Locking of the pin <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> in place thus also locks the strap end <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> to the battery assembly <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> It is noted that the end <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> of each of the straps <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> can be locked to other areas of the battery assembly <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, instead of being locked by the pin <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> of the locking assembly <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>. For example, posts <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> (see, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>) can be provided in the respective recessed areas <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> of the cover <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and the apertures <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> of the straps inserted over and locked to these posts and, hence, to the cover <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In an additional aspect of the invention, the terminal pieces <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> are designed to have a wing nut configuration which permits them to be easily attached to the respective positive or negative terminal. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</cross-reference> show two wing nut configurations for the pieces <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the piece <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is made of machined stainless steel with a threaded bore <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and wings <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. The circumferential groove <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> has an upper inward step <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> followed by a lower inward step <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the piece <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> includes an outer shroud <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> of molded plastic which surrounds a nut <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> having an interior threaded bore <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The outer shroud <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> includes wings <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and a circumferential groove <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The terminal pieces <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> can also be color coded to differentiate the piece to be used for the positive terminal of the battery assembly from the piece to be used for the negative terminal of the battery. Thus, the negative terminal piece can be colored black and the positive terminal piece red. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In the battery assembly <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a handle assembly <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> is also provided This assembly comprises a handle <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and attachment members <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. Each attachment member is passed through aligned slots and apertures in the flanges in the cover <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and casing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to attach the attachment member to the battery assembly. This can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> for the attachment member <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the various parts of the battery assembly <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be made of molded plastic. Thus, the casing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, top member <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and cover <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> of the assembly can all be formed from molded plastic parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In all cases it is understood that the above-described arrangements are merely illustrative of the many possible specific embodiments which represent applications of the present invention. Numerous and varied other arrangements can be readily devised in accordance with the principles of the present invention without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. </paragraph>
