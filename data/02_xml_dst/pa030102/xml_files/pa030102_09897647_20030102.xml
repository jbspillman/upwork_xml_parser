<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> A field of the invention is print servers. Other fields of the invention include print data services, wireless portable devices, and web based services. The invention provides support of print by reference operations in which print content is addressed by a reference, such as might be supplied by a wireless portable device or a print device. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The traditional model for print operations is the pushing of content to a print device from a device. Most often, this involves a computer communicating with a print device, e.g., a printer or multi-function peripheral including a print function. The communication may follow the format of wired connection interface, such as the case where a print device connects to a print device over a serial or parallel computer port. The communication might also follow a wireless connection such as that used for communication through an infrared port. The basic operation in either case involves a device, e.g., a computer, linking to a computer, converting content into a format acceptable to the print device, and then transferring the data to the print device. As an example, a computer printing a Microsoft Word document addresses a print device, converts the document data and format information into a print device ready format, and pushes the data to the print device. Protocol standards handle the communication between the print device and the device pushing the data to be printed. Print servers, typically software resident or cooperative with a data generating program, convert data into a native print device format. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The traditional model limits print operations in a number of ways. One important limitation is the inability of the print device to be used by devices lacking the ability to convert data into a print device ready format. Even if this inability were overcome by some manner, another limitation concerns the practical limits of the types of devices and device connections that may utilize a print device. Specifically, devices that lack sufficient memory resources to store data to be printed are, as practical matter, unable to make effective use of a print device. In addition, devices that lack a sufficiently fast or sufficiently reliable communication link to the print device also may not effectively use the print device. A particular class of devices that might lack sufficient memory for print content, or a fast enough device-print device interface, or a reliable enough device-print device interface, are portable wireless devices. Personal digital assistants (PDAs), cell phones, wireless data terminals and other wireless devices would have increased usefulness, and add increased usefulness to print devices, if the wireless devices had efficient print capabilities. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Print by reference expands printing and the usefulness of wireless devices and print devices by permitting a reference to data content that is to be printed to be passed from a device to initiate a print job. The invention concerns a service to support the print by reference operation. The service method accepts a reference to content, transcodes the content, and establishes the transcoded content to be taken for printing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, a print service of the invention executes a method that accepts, from a print client, a reference to print content targeted for printing from a location indicated by the reference. The reference is resolved to determine the location indicated by the reference. Print data is obtained from that location and transcoded into a print device ready format. The print client is allowed to access print ready formatted data, which may be transferred to the print client in response to a request from the print client. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment print service of the invention, preferably realized as a web site or part of web site, software hosted or accessible by the web site performs the required functions. A print client may be a print device, for example, that has an Internet connection. A print client might also be a portable wireless device, for example, which then might transfer data transcoded by the print service to a print device. The print service method provides commercial potential for web services and content provider partnerships, as a preferred use of the print service might commence with a user of a portable wireless device obtaining a reference to print content while web surfing, communicating that content, for example via a Bluetooth wireless connection to the print device, which then uses the print service to resolve and process the print by reference communication.

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A print service method is provided by the invention for supporting print by reference operations being conducted by a print device. In a preferred form, the print service method is provided through a web site that is used by a print device handling a print by reference operation. The print service might also be part of print device software, as another example. Print device software performing the method of the invention might therefore be part of the software executed in printers or multi-function peripherals, as well as peripheral print devices such as HP JETDIRECT&reg; devices, including internal JETDIRECT&reg; cards or external JETDIRECT&reg; plug in print server devices. A device including software for executing the print service method of the invention generally requires direct or indirect access to print content to be referenced by print by reference operations. The most important type of content and the content likely to be referenced in the print by reference operations is accessed via the Internet, and the preferred direct or indirect connection is therefore a direct or indirect Internet connection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In the case of a remote print service accessed via the Internet, the transcoded data transfer to the print device is preferably conducted with the print service setting up a Universal Resource Locator address for the transcoded data and then communicating the Universal Resource Locator address for the print data to the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a preferred environment for implementing the print service method of the invention. A print device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> accesses a print service of the invention, either via the Internet to a web site print service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, or through another connection to a local print service <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> that may comprise software in the print device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> when the print device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is carrying out a print-by-reference operation. While the local print service <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is shown as an external device to the print device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, it may also be internal to the print device. For example, it may be native software or an add on software. It might also be installed as a firmware card. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The print device uses the print service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to resolve and access the content to be printed. With the print device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> being accessible to a portable wireless device <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the print service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can therefore aid a print by reference operation initiated by the portable wireless device <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. From the perspective of the print service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, either of the print device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or portable wireless device <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be viewed as a print client for a print by reference operation irrespective of whether the &ldquo;print client&rdquo; is directly or eventually making use of the print service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. A likely scenario involves the portable wireless device <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> accessing a content provider <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, typically a web site over the Internet. The web site might include a link to print content, such as a &ldquo;print-this&rdquo; link. If selected, the print by reference target is transmitted to the portable wireless device <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, which then can commence a print by reference operation with the print device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In the preferred environment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the portable wireless device uses Bluetooth wireless <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to communicate a print by reference target to the print device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or, perhaps, directly to the print service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The print device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> then accesses the print service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> via an Internet interface <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. However, the print services <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be accessed in other manners including, for example, cellular network communications or RF. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Bluetooth is a preferred wireless RF standard developed by a technology industry consortium made up of 3Com, Ericsson, IBM, Intel, Agere, Microsoft, Motorola, Nokia, and Toshiba with a mission of creating a standard wireless protocol. More information, including protocol specifications, can be obtained on the Bluetooth website: www.bluetooth.com, with the content available from this and linked websites incorporated herein by reference. The current Bluetooth protocol has an operable range of about 10 meters, but may sometimes prove to have greater range. As an example software/device for the underlying Bluetooth communication usable by the print services <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the print device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or the portable wirless device <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, a Bluetooth PC card was unveiled by 3Com on May 29, 2001. The card follows the new Bluetooth 1.1 specification and uses 3Com&apos;s connection manager software. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Other example communication protocols suitable for practice within the scope of the invention that have available commercial support are those specified by IEEE 802.11 standard. 100 meters is the optimal 802.11 maximum range, but 802.11 can work at around 300 meters. However the data rate goes from 11 Mega bits per second to about 1 or 2 Mega bits per second as range increases. Bluetooth power class III is designed for 10 meters at low power. Bluetooth Power class I uses 100 milliwatts and can go about 100 meters. Artisans will also appreciate that wireless protocols other than 802.11 and Bluetooth, e.g., infrared, might also be used and that certain preferred features, e.g., an OBEX connect are therefore unique to the preferred Bluetooth embodiment since the Bluetooth protocol requires a CONNECT while OBEX does not. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> For example, the wireless device <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> typically has Internet access. This Internet access may be through a cellular network interface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The print service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, preferably a web site, would have an Internet interface <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The print service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may therefore be realized as a web site by software resident in a web host. The content provider <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is also typically a web site, and therefore would have an Internet interface <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, as well. The local print service <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> requires an Internet interface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to access a content provider that is a web site. The interface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be the same interface used by the print device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> A number of paths for passing a print reference and channeling print data and print services are therefore possible. Alternate preferred embodiments include the use of the local print service <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with either the print service <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> or the portable wireless device <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> accessing the content provider <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Either of the print services may be accessed by the print device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or the portable wireless device <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, either one of the print services <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> accepts a reference <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to print content targeted for printing from a location indicated by the reference. The print service <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> accepts the reference, for example, directly from the print device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The print service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, on the other hand, accepts the reference via Internet interface <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The print service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, however, may also receive the reference <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> from a wireless connection to the portable wireless device <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. This connection might be via Bluetooth <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> or the cellular network interface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> A print service needs to be discovered or located by a print device or portable wireless device before it can be used, which thus may be a preliminary step to accepting a reference. Discovery may occur in a number of different ways. Some preferred possibilities are the following models for print service discovery. The location of a print service may be pre-configured <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> into a print device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or portable wireless device. Another alternative is for a print service to be registered <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> into a service registry. Print devices and portable wireless devices can use the registry to locate a print service based on some set of search constraints. Alternate search based discovery <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is also possible, e.g., any form of search engine. A print service can also be located <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> via network discovery protocols. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The print service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> resolves a reference <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to determine the location indicated by the reference, typically a content provider <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> accessible by a Universal Resource locator. In that typical case, the reference will be a Universal Resource Locator that addresses print content targeted for printing. The accepted reference may be an individual reference, or multiple references. Accepting a reference thus may be accepting a reference list of individual references that individually reference print content stored at a location, e.g., a list of multiple Universal Resource Locators to resolve <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Preferably, each reference in a list is processed separately followed by complete sequential processing of remaining references in a list. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The print service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, after resolving a reference <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, then obtains the print data <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> from the location indicated by the reference. The print service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> transcodes the print data <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> into a print device ready format, then allows access to the transcoded print data <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Transcoding is translating obtained data into a form that can be used for printing. Preferably, the transcoding changes data into form independent of the print device type (brand) used. Preferred example formats include HTML, ASCII, and PDF. Alternatively, the transcoding can translate the data into print formats dependent upon the type of print device. Dependent formats may be the proprietary formats used by different print device manufacturers. Recognition of an appropriate format is a concern with the remote print service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, but the print service <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> embedded within or peripheral to a particular print device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can likely have transcoding tailored to the particular print device. The transcoded print data is transferred <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> to the print device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in response to a request from the print device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In the case of the remote print service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> accessed via the Internet, the transcoded data transfer to the print device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is preferably conducted with the print service setting up a Universal Resource Locator address for the transcoded data and then communicating the Universal Resource Locator address for the print data to the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> At the time of accepting a reference <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the print service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> also may initiate a control communication <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> with the print device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> control channel <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and data channel <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> may be separate. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the control communication is preferably conducted via an argument resolution protocol <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> namely, the SOAP protocol (Simple Object Access Protocol). The preferred data channel <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> uses an HTTP protocol. The control channel <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is convenient for passing arguments and responses. Such a need for responses can occur when accessing the location including the print content, e.g., the content provider <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Print service communications are layered on top of HTTP (HTTPS when secure access is used). HTTP is preferred because it provides an efficient and ubiquitous transport mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> SOAP is preferably used to define three actions that are exported by the print service, job create, status check and job cancel. These actions along with generic HTTP access (HTTP GET and POST) support the requirements for the remote print service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A client initiates a print job using CreatePSJob <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. This action provides the print service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with information required to create a print job and to begin the processing of a print operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In a preferred protocol, the print service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> creates a unique Job Identifier (JobID) that can be used in subsequent operations to identify the print Job. CreatePSJob supports both print by reference and information upload as a means of providing content to the print service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. If the client is printing a reference then this is sent the Reference argument of action. If the client plans to upload information to the print service it does not specify a reference argument in the action request. When the client indicates that it wants to upload the information to be printed the client can include a DataSink URL in the CreatePSJob response. The client must then send the information to the print service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> using a separate HTTP POST operation to the DataSink URL. The print service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> also returns the JobID and a PrintSrc URL to client. The PrintSrc URL is used to retrieve the print ready information once the print service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has transcoded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The reference, e.g., web site, might issue a security challenge as the print service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> attempts to obtain the print data. In that case, the print service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> accepts a security challenge <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) from the print data content location, e.g., content provider <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The SOAP protocol <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> can be conveniently used to conduct a security communication <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). This communication <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> might pass on the security challenge to the print service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> obtain information necessary for response, if the information was not initially provided to the print service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. When the print service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has information necessary to respond, it then may respond to the security challenge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The print service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may respond to the security challenge in a number of preferred ways. Access credentials may be included in the reference to content that is provided to the print service, and are thus received at the time that the print service accepts a reference in step <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. If not initially provided when the print service accepts a reference, the print service may pass the challenge back to the client who then may re-submit the request with the correct security information included. Another option is for the print service to support privacy through the encryption of the information exchanged between the print service and client, e.g. between print service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the print device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. This encryption can be imposed at the link level, e.g., HTTPS or IPSec, at the time of connection set-up. Since this level of security occurs at the link level it has no affect on the method of print by reference communications between the print service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and client, i.e., the print device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or the portable wireless device <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Another approach is to have the information encrypted above the link level. An encryption/decryption and/or identification key can be used in print by reference communications with the print service. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The control channel also may be used to conduct job control. Job control allows the print service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to manage individual print by reference jobs, and allows handling of multiple jobs from separate clients. Multiple job handling is important if the print service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is to serve independent business services. For example, a print service web site hosting a print service of the invention for print by reference operations might be a paid service. Such a print service web site might alternatively be a supplement to some other commercial transaction. Thus, a purchaser of a print device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or a portable wireless device <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, or a purchaser of web services or wireless airtime might obtain access to a print by reference print service web site that implements the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Job control is especially important for the remote print service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, as it is likely to handle multiple jobs and deal with diverse print devices and portable wireless devices as different clients. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> generally illustrates a preferred job control communication. Preferably, when the print service accepts a print by reference request, a print job is created <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and a job identifier is assigned <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to the print job. The job identifier is communicated to the print device <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, or alternatively a portable communication device if the portable communication device is communicating with the print service. Subsequent print control operations through the control channel <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are conducted using the assigned job identifier to link operations to a particular print job. The print service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can preferably support a reflected user interface (RUI). The RUI is a web page used to control the print job using a web form that is reflected back to the user of the portable wireless device <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The user would then be able to select options or fills out the form to provide job control parameters. The job identifier enables, for example, the print service to include the job identifier as a state variable that the print device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or the portable wireless device <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> returns as a result of selecting a hyper link included in the RUI web markup. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> It is preferable for the print service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to permit a client print device or portable wireless device to set attributes. Thus, the print service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> should accept print attributes <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The attributes may determine the outcome of the print operation. The print service should also provide for default attributes <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> in the event that some or all attributes are not provided by a print service client, i.e., the print service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> supports a standard set of print options. Extensions to the standard set of print options should be supported <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> to allow for evolution and support of differentiated vertical markets. Supporting extensions allows for updating of the print service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to account, for example, for new print formats and new print devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The print service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> also should obtain some understanding of the client&apos;s capabilities <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. The step of transcoding <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> translates the print data into a print device ready format, thus requiring some knowledge of the capabilities of a particular print device client and its configuration in order to provide print ready information. A client, i.e., a print device or portable wireless device, should also be provided with some forms of job control <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. Examples are the ability to query the status <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) of a print job or to cancel a print job <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Security of the remote print service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be a separate issue from the security of the content provider <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. A remote print service may need to protect itself from unauthorized use. To support this need the print service can provide a separate security check <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> for the print service to discover the identity of the client device to enforce access control. The server security check <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is preferably conducted at the time that a print job is created <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. One option for the security check <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is to require the client to provide credentials <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in order to access the print service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The security check can be similar to the manner for checking security in response to a challenge by the content provider <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Billing may be addressed with the security check for the print service, as the print service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may require billing ID <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> for use by a client. The print service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> could use any standard or widely used billing models for the financial clearance conducted as part of a security communication <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In the case of the remote print service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> accessed via the Internet, the transcoded data transfer to the print device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is preferably conducted with the print service setting up a Universal Resource Locator address for the transcoded data and then communicating the Universal Resource Locator address for the print data to the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> While a specific embodiment of the present invention has been shown and others described, it should be understood that other modifications, substitutions and alternatives are apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art. Such modifications, substitutions and alternatives can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, which should be determined from the appended claims. </paragraph>
