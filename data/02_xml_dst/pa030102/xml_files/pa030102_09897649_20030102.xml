<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, a prior art plug is illustrated. The plug mainly has a casing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Two male terminals b and c, connecting wires d, and connecting holes e are installed in the casing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Another ends of the two parallel male terminals b, c are connected with two elastic pieces f and g so as to be formed as a receptacle. Although the connecting wires d, and connecting holes e are installed for removing electric static charges, but the receptacle and plug are extended from the two male terminals to another end of the casing a and then is coupled with preset elastic pieces f and g. Therefore, no safety device is installed between the receptacle and the plug. Also, no device may cause the user to know the condition of the electric devices. Therefore, as circuit is interrupted or the load of the current is over the burden of the circuit, or abnormality occurs, it is very possible that a dramatic accident such as fire accident may occurs. Therefore, the prior art structure is necessary to be improved. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In order that those skilled in the art can further understand the present invention, a description will be described in the following in details. However, these descriptions and the appended drawings are only used to cause those skilled in the art to understand the objects, features, and characteristics of the present invention, but not to be used to confine the scope and spirit of the present invention defined in the appended claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the adapter of the present invention is illustrated. The adapter of the present invention is mainly formed by an upper cover <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a lower cover <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The upper cover <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has a shape having two larger ends and a thinner middle portion and is integrally formed by plastics. The upper cover <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is installed with a fuse inlet hole <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, an indicator hole <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and a notch <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The fuse inlet hole <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be tightly sealed by a transparent cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The lower block <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of the transparent cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is exactly buckled between the notch <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and a notch <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> at the lower cover <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. When a plug A is inserted, it exactly resists against the transparent cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The indicator hole <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may be engaged with a transparent cover <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The bottom of the upper cover <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has a plurality of posts <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The lower cover <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has a shape correspondent to the upper cover <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The lower cover <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is installed with a fuse receiving groove <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, an indicator receiving groove <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, an assembling grooves <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and a notch <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> with respect to the fuse inlet hole <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, indicator hole <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, posts <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and notch <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. A rotary unit receiving groove <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is formed in front of the fuse receiving groove <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The left and right sides of the rotary unit receiving groove <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> have connecting piece receiving grooves <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>&prime;. Two female terminal receiving grooves <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>&prime; extends from the connecting piece receiving grooves <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>&prime;, respectively, from the left and right sides of the indicator receiving groove <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The rear sides of the two female terminal receiving grooves <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>&prime; are connected to two receptacle holes <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>&prime;, respectively. The indicator receiving groove <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the rotary unit receiving groove <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are installed with an indicator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and a cylindrical rotary unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The buckling grooves <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>&prime; at the left and right sides of the cylindrical rotary unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are buckled to two male terminals <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>&prime;, respectively, and then the rotary unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is placed in the rotary unit receiving groove <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The outer lateral surfaces of the two parallel male terminals <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>&prime; are buckled with respective connecting pieces <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&prime;. Then the two connecting pieces <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&prime; are connected with two female terminals <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>&prime;, respectively so that the openings of the two female terminals <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>&prime; are exactly connected to respective receptacle holes <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>&prime;, respectively. The male terminal <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is connected to the fuse <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> through a connecting piece <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>. By rotating the cylindrical rotary unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the two male terminals <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>&prime; can rotate through a proper angle so as to be used conveniently. When the outer plug A is inserted into the receptacle holes <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>&prime;, since the two female terminals <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>&prime; expand due to the insertion of the plug A, and thus, the female terminals <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>&prime; resist against a positive and a negative electrode <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>&prime; of the indicator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The circuit of the indicator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is formed as a loop for emitting light. Therefore, if only the plug A is not inserted well or abnormality occurs in the circuit or the fuse <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is broken, the circuit of the indicator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can not be formed as a loop so as not to emit light. Therefore, the indicator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has the functions of checking the plug A, fuse <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, circuits of connecting electric devices. Furthermore, through the fuse <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, as the current is over the tolerance of the fuse <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the fuse <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> will melt. As a result, not only the electric devices are protected, but also the firing of electric wire is prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Moreover, referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the exploded view, assembled view, and front cross sectional view of another embodiment of the present invention are illustrated. From the figures, it is appreciated that other than structural feature, in the present invention, the two parallel male terminals <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>&prime; can be directly installed below the lower cover <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> so that the two male terminals <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>&prime; are fixed without rotation. Similarly, the two male terminals <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>&prime; are connected to the female terminals <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>&prime; through the connecting pieces <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&prime;, respectively. One female terminal <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is connected to the fuse <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> through another connecting piece <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, while the indicator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is still installed in the indicator receiving groove <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, but not to contact with the two female terminals <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>&prime;. Besides, the bottom of the lower cover <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is installed with an embedding strip <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. The embedding strip <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is used to be embedded into a connecting body B. The connecting wires B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and connecting holes B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the connecting body B are used to remove the electric static charges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> From above structure, other than above embodiment, in the present invention, the two female terminals <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>&prime; can be designed as clamping heads for connecting with electric wires, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> to form a plug so that the plug has the function of indicator and fuse. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The present invention are thus described, it will be obvious that the same may be varied in many ways. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the present invention, and all such modifications as would be obvious to one skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of the following claims. </paragraph>
