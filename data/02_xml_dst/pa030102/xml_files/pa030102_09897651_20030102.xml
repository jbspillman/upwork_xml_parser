<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">An adjustable self retaining retractor ring assembly is provided. The self retaining retractor ring assembly is formed from two half-rings connected together by hinges to form a 360&deg; enclosure or ring. The hinges allow the two half-rings to bend or pivot 180&deg; relative to a plane of the ring. One of the hinges includes a positionable locking mechanism to lock or set the angular orientation of the two half-rings relative to each other. In this manner, fixed angles for the half-rings can be selected and maintained. Each half-ring includes a plurality of axially protruding pegs or posts (relative to a plane of the half-ring) positioned thereabout. The posts are shaped to releasably accept retractors and/or ancillary instruments thereon. Additionally, each post preferably includes a slot configured to allow for the locking of suture material therein. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to retractors, and more particularly, to a retractor ring assembly. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Open and mini-open surgical procedures require a varying amount of instruments for retracting and holding both instruments and the patient&apos;s tissue. More particularly, there are many soft tissue surgical procedures, such as about the shoulder for example, that require an open or mini-open technique, as opposed to an arthroscopic technique. The nature of these open and mini-open procedures typically requires expensive resources (i.e. additional staff such as surgeons and assistants) to assist with retraction by holding the various retraction and/or surgical instruments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Unfortunately, additional staff is costly, as well as a source of inconsistency for retraction. In view of this, there have been developed various devices to assist the surgeon in retraction positioning and retention during such open and mini-open surgical procedures. One such device known as the Hawkins Bell&reg; system currently marketed by DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. of Warsaw, Indiana, uses a shaft bent into a U-shape that can hold three retractors. Two of the retractors must be positioned at the ends of the shaft, and the third retractor is attached to the shaft through a small locking block. The primary disadvantages of this system are: 1) that attachments such as retractors cannot be positioned anywhere (360&deg;) surrounding the wound (opening); 2) the system is not adaptable to a patient&apos;s anatomy; and 3) sutures cannot be retracted using the system. Since the shaft cannot bend, this eliminates the ability to adjust the A/P direction of retraction, as well as S/I and M/L. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Other devices for retraction holding have been developed such as self-retracting forceps. These forceps allow the attachment of retractor blades to the ends of the forceps. The forceps, thus opening the wound, can thus separate the blades. A disadvantage to these devices is the lack of flexibility, i.e. there is no control over the direction of retraction. Additionally, only two retractors can be mounted to the forceps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In sum, these previous devices/attempts, however, have lacked the flexibility to be used in a wide variety of applications, without creating more nuisance than assistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> What is therefore needed is a self retaining retractor holder that overcomes one or more of the drawbacks associated with prior art retractor holders. What is also needed is a self retaining retractor ring that is adaptable to the contours of a patient. What is further needed is a self retaining retractor ring that includes functionality in addition to holding retractors. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> While the invention is susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, specific embodiments thereof have been shown by way of example in the drawings and will herein be described in detail. It should be understood, however, that there is no intent to limit the invention to the particular forms disclosed, but on the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Referring now to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, there is shown a retractor holding or ring assembly, generally designated <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, in accordance with the principles presented herein. The retractor ring assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes a first ring portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and a second ring portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The first and second ring portions <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are coupled to one another at first respective ends <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> (see additionally <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>) thereof via a first pivot or hinge assembly <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The first and second ring portions <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are coupled to one another at second respective ends <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> (see additionally <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>) thereof via a second pivot or hinge assembly <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The first hinge assembly <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the second hinge assembly <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> permit the ring assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to articulate, swing, or pivot. With additional reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, such articulating is represented by the double-headed arrow. The first and second ring portions <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are articulatable into a common plane define by the ring portions <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (arbitrarily, 0&deg;) and through 180&deg;The first and second ring portions may be positioned into various angles off of the plane (0&deg;). Additionally, the hinge assembly <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> also allows the two ring portions or halves to &ldquo;shift&rdquo; along an axis defined by the hinge assembly <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. This permits, in one respect, the lockable hinge assembly <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to release or unlock for an angle change. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>, the first and second ring portions <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are each of an arcuate shape. More particularly, the first and second ring portions <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are preferably relatively flat, semi-circular members such that a ring formed thereby is substantially circular. The first and second arcuate portions <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may, however, take other shapes so that the resulting union thereof creates a ring that is oblong, elliptical, or the like. Each ring portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is preferably made of a suitable metal such as stainless steel, a titanium alloy, or the like. Of course, other suitable material may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The retractor ring assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> further includes a plurality of posts or pegs <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> disposed on a respective upper surface of the first and second ring portions <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Each peg is positioned in a bore or hole in the ring portion. The pegs <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are preferably spaced about each ring portion such that the pegs encompass 360&deg; about an opening <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> defined by the ring portions <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> when assembled. Further, while twenty-two (22) pegs <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are shown, any number may suffice. Each peg <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> extends axially outwardly from its respective ring portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, a peg <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> representative of all pegs <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is depicted in greater detail. The peg <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> includes a base or seating portion <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> that is adapted to abut the upper surface of the respective ring portion. Extending axially downwardly from the base <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is a seating post <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> that is received in a bore or hole of a ring portion. Extending axially upwardly from the base <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is a center post <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. A peg head <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is positioned on the center post <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. The peg head <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> includes a slot <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight>. The slot <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> is configured to releaseably retain a suture therein. Additionally and preferably, the slot <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> is radially aligned with a center point of the opening <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the ring assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The peg <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is preferably made of a suitable metal such as stainless steel, a titanium alloy, or the like. Each peg <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is attached to a respective ring portion. Preferably, each slot <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> is tapered so as to enable the slot <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> to retain a portion of a suture from the wound. Each peg <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is configured to receive and releasably retain an instrument, particularly a surgical instrument, via a complementary hole in the surgical instrument. The surgical instrument is preferably a retractor. Thus, a plurality of surgical instruments are attachable to the retractor ring <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> via the pegs <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Referring back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the hinge assembly <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> pivotally couples the end <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the ring portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> with the end <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of the ring portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The hinge assembly <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> includes a first hinge portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> that is coupled to a second hinge portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> via a hinge pin <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The first hinge portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is fixedly attached to the end <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, while the second hinge portion <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is fixedly attached to the end <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The hinge assembly <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> allows the ring portions <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to pivot downwardly, but not upwardly with respect to the plane defined by the ring portions (ref. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The hinge assembly <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> pivotally couples the end <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the ring portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> with the end <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the ring portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The hinge assembly <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> includes a knob <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, a locking washer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and a locking screw washer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The hinge assembly <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> allows the ring portions <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to pivot downwardly, but not upwardly with respect to the plane defined by the ring portions (ref. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). Further, the hinge assembly <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is releasably lockable to releasably fix an angle of articulation of the ring portions <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Particularly, the hinge assembly <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is releasably lockable in discrete steps to fix various angles of orientation of the ring portions <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Thus, the ring assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be configured to adapt to the contours of a patient when the ring assembly is placed on the patient. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the hinge assembly <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is shown in greater detail. In particular, the lock washer <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the locking screw washer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is attached to either the ring portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> or the ring portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, while the lock washer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is attached to the other of the ring portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> or ring portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The screw or threaded shaft <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of the locking screw washer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> (of which the lock washer portion <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is seen) extends through the bore <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of the lock washer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and threadedly engages the threaded opening <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of the knob shaft <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Tightening of the knob <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> causes the bevel <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the shaft <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the knob <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to abut the rear surface <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> of the lock washer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Further tightening causes the teeth <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of the lock washer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to engage the teeth <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of the lock washer body <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Since a ring portion is coupled to one of the lock washers <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, the orientation of the lock washers <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> relative to each other sets the angle of the ring assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Loosening of the knob <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> allows at least one of the lock washers <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to rotate relative to the other, or both, to reposition the ring portions <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> into another angle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, the retractor ring assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is shown having a first retractor <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> attached thereto, and a second retractor <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> attached thereto. The present invention provides the retractors <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> (and in general all surgical instruments attached thereto) in a radial loading pattern anywhere in the 360&deg; range of pegs <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In a manner similar to any instrument that is releasably attachable to the ring assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the retractor <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of bores <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> that are configured to accept a peg <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> therein. The bores <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> are positioned along a shaft <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> of the retractor <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. In this manner, the retractor <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> may be arcuately positionable on any peg <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and is radially inwardly or outwardly adjustable for the particular surgical opening. The blade <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> of the retractor <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> may thus be inwardly or outwardly positionable to hold open the surgical opening. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The retractor <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> likewise includes a plurality of bores <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> that are configured to accept a peg <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> therein. The bores <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> are positioned along a shaft <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> of the retractor <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. In this manner, the retractor <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> may be arcuately positionable on any peg <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and is radially inwardly or outwardly adjustable for the particular surgical opening. The blade <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> of the retractor <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> may thus be inwardly or outwardly positionable to hold open the surgical opening. It should be appreciated that more than two instruments may be supported by the present ring assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, limited only by the amount of room around the ring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> It should further be appreciated that while the ring portions <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> in a 0&deg; position, they may be angled as shown and described herein in accordance with the principles of the present invention. The ring assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> further defines an opening <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> that is situated over the surgical opening (or area where a surgical opening is to be made) during use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> It should be appreciated that variations on the above are possible. Particularly, with respect to the pegs <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and corresponding bores of an instrument, the pegs and bores may be reversed. The pegs may be formed as part of the instrument rather than holes, in which case the holes may be formed on the ring portions rather than pegs. Further, the locking hinge may take many forms other than that shown. The locking hinge may be spring-loaded and/or provide for a quick-change of angles, or for biasing the ring assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> into a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In addition, since the present ring assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is very stable once installed, the ring assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be used as a baseline alignment device. Thus, various measurements and the like may be made from the ring assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, as well as the positioning of other instruments/procedures independent of the ring assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
