<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an optical fiber plug, and more particularly to an illuminating optical fiber plug which has a transparent hollow connector such that a light signal transmitting in the illuminating optical fiber plug can be observed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> With the rapid growth of electronic technology, a medium used today for transmitting signals in electronic devices needs to have a significant capacity of transmitting a large quantity of signals. An optical fiber is invented and used in order to satisfy this demand of the high performance medium. The optical fiber can transmit signals in a level of efficiency that a traditional medium such as a copper wire can never reach. Therefore, the optical fiber is becoming an important medium for transmitting signals in the electronic and the photoelectric technology. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> To connect the optical fiber to an electronic device, the optical fiber is connected to an optical fiber plug. The optical fiber plug is then plugged in a corresponding socket of the electronic device. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>, a conventional optical fiber plug (<highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>) has a housing (<highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>) made of a opaque material, a hollow connector (<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>) also made of the opaque material and protruding from a front end of the housing (<highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>), and a receiving hole (<highlight><bold>541</bold></highlight>) defined in a rear portion of the housing (<highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>) to receive an optical fiber (<highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>). Further referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, when in use, the hollow connector (<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>) is plugged in a socket (<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>) of an electronic device, and the optical fiber (<highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>) extends through the optical fiber plug (<highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>) to align with an LED (Light Emitting Diode, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>). The LED (<highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>) is a light source for generating light signals and the light signals are transmitted through the optical fiber (<highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> However, due to the housing (<highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>) and the hollow connector (<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>) being opaque, when the optical fiber plug (<highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>) is plugged in the socket (<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>), the transmitting condition of the light signals can not be observed by a user. Thus, the user has to unplug the optical fiber plug (<highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>) from the socket (<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>) to verify whether the LED (<highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>) is sending signals or not and this procedure is not convenient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Moreover, when the electronic device is not connected to the optical fiber (<highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>), the optical fiber socket (<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>) can easily be contaminated by dust in the air. To prevent the dust from entering the socket (<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>), a cap plug is used to cover the socket (<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>). Again, because the cap plug is made of a opaque material thus the light signal generated by the LED (<highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>) still can not be observed and so the condition of the LED (<highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>) can not be known with the cap plug plugged in the socket (<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> To overcome the shortcomings, the present invention tends to provide an illuminating optical fiber plug to mitigate or obviate the aforementioned problems. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, a first embodiment of an illuminating optical fiber plug (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) in accordance with the present invention has a hollow connector (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) made of a transparent material and a housing (<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) made of a opaque material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The hollow connector (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) is received in the housing (<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) and a first end (<highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>) of the hollow connector (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) extends out of a front portion of the housing (<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>). The hollow connector (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) has a second end (<highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>) received in the housing (<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) and the second end (<highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>) diverges into two branch portions (<highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>). The branch portions (<highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>) each has an illuminating end (<highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight>) oppositely extending through the housing (<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) to communicate with an outer surface (<highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>) of the housing (<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>). A receiving hole (<highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>) is defined in a rear portion of the housing (<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) and extends into the front portion of the housing (<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) to communicate with the second end (<highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>) of the hollow connector (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, an optical fiber (<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>) has a fiber core (<highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>) and a fiber cladding (<highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>), and the optical fiber (<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>) extends into the optical fiber plug (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) through the receiving hole (<highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>). The fiber core (<highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>) of the optical fiber (<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>) further extends into the hollow connector (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> When in use, still referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the optical fiber plug (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) is plugged into a corresponding socket (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>) having an LED (<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>) formed inside the socket (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>). The LED (<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>) aligns with the first end (<highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>) of the hollow connector (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) and the fiber core (<highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>) in the hollow connector (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>). Therefore, a light signal generated by the LED (<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>) is transmitted through the fiber core (<highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>) which aligns with the LED (<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>) and due to the transparency of the hollow connector (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>), each illuminating end (<highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight>) will illuminate and show a flashing dot on the outer surface (<highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>) of the housing (<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>). Thus, a user can easily know the condition of the light signal transmitting through the optical fiber plug (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) by observing the flashing dot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> With reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, a second preferred embodiment of the present invention is formed as a 3.5 &phgr; optical fiber plug which is also commonly used in appliances related to optical fibers to correspond to a 3.5 &phgr; socket (not shown). In this preferred embodiment, an illuminating optical fiber plug (<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>) has a hollow connector (<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>) elongated to correspond to the 3.5 &phgr; socket. The hollow connector (<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>) is made of a transparent material and extended from a housing (<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>) made of a opaque material. The hollow connector (<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>) has a first end (<highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight>) protruding from a front portion of the housing (<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>) and a second end (<highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>) received in the housing (<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>). The second end (<highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>) has an illuminating protrusion (<highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>) radially extending therefrom with an illuminating end (<highlight><bold>3201</bold></highlight>) extending through the housing (<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>) to communicate with an outer surface (<highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>) of the housing (<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>). Similar to the first preferred embodiment, when in use, an LED (not shown) in the 3.5 &phgr; socket generates a light signal, and due to the transparency of the hollow connector (<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>), the illuminating end (<highlight><bold>3201</bold></highlight>) will illuminate and show a flashing dot on the outer surface (<highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>) of the housing (<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>) for a user to know the condition of the light signal transmitting through the illuminating optical fiber plug (<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7, a</cross-reference> third preferred embodiment of the present invention is shown and formed as a cap plug (<highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>) for the socket (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>). The cap plug (<highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>) has a hollow connector (<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>) made of a transparent material and a housing (<highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>) made of a opaque material. Similar to the first preferred embodiment, the hollow connector (<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>) has a first end (<highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight>) and a second end (<highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>). The first end (<highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight>) extends outwardly from the housing to align with the LED (<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>) in the socket (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>). The second end (<highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>) is received in the housing and diverges into two branch portions (<highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>). Each of the branch portions (<highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>) has an illuminating end (<highlight><bold>4201</bold></highlight>) extending through the housing (<highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>) to communicate with an outer surface (<highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>) of the housing (<highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>). When the socket (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>) is not inserted in the optical fiber plug (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>), in order to prevent dust from entering the socket (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>), the cap plug (<highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>) is plugged into the socket (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>) with the connector (<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>) aligning with the LED (<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>). Therefore, when the LED (<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>) generates the light signal, the illuminating end (<highlight><bold>4201</bold></highlight>) illuminates accordingly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> It is noted that the housings (<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>) and the hollow connectors (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>) in the preceding preferred embodiment can be integrally formed from a transparent material thus the optical fiber plugs (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>) and the cap plug (<highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>) as a whole can be illuminating. Furthermore, in order to be decorative and to protect human eyes, the optical fiber plugs (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>) and the cap plug (<highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>) that are integrally formed from the transparent material can be formed with a pattern or tinted to reduce the transparency of the optical fiber plugs (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>) and the cap plug (<highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> From the above description, it is noted that the invention has the following advantages: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> 1. The condition of the light signals transmitting through the illuminating optical fiber plug plugged in the socket can be easily known by observing the flashing dot on the housing and the user does not have to unplug the illuminating optical fiber plug to check the condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> 2. The flashing dot can help to indicate the position of the illuminating optical fiber plug especially in a dimly-lit room. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> It is to be understood, however, that even though numerous characteristics and advantages of the present invention have been set forth in the foregoing description, together with details of the structure and function of the invention, the disclosure is illustrative only, and changes may be made in detail, especially in matters of shape, size, and arrangement of parts within the principles of the invention to the full extent indicated by the broad general meaning of the terms in which the appended claims are expressed. </paragraph>
