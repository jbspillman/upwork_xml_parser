<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF AN EXAMPLE EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, as viewed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, an anti-lock braking system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes an integrated electronic assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> comprises electronic circuitry typically in the form of a printed circuit board <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, a motor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> for driving a pump for the anti-lock braking system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a hydromechanical block <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> for controlling flow of pressurized fluid provided by the pump, a lead frame <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, a plurality of devices typically in the form of solenoid coils <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, eight shown), one or more pressure sensor interfaces <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>, and a component <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. The component <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> may be any known electrical component for the anti-lock braking system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The circuit board <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has a planar first surface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and a planar second surface <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> opposite the first surface. The hydromechanical block <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is located between the circuit board <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> on one side and the lead frame <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and plurality of solenoid coils <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> on the other side of the hydromechanical block. The hydromechanical block <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> has a through bore <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> for providing direct access from the circuit board <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to the lead frame <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The lead frame <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> has a planar first surface <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and a planar second surface <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> opposite the first surface of the lead frame. Each of the plurality of solenoid coils <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and the pressure sensor interface(s) <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> typically has two connectors <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, such as solderable connectors. The solderable connectors <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> are typically inserted completely through corresponding holes in the lead frame <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and secured to the lead frame by solder <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> on the second surface <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of the lead frame, as is known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The lead frame <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> has a serial drive component <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> for electrically interconnecting the plurality of solenoid coils <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and the circuit board <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The serial drive component <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> exchanges input/output data between a pair of first connection points (i.e., the connectors <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>) corresponding to each solenoid coil <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>/pressure sensor interface <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> and at least two second connection points of the circuit board <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The serial drive component <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> encodes/decodes communication/control data between the solenoid coils/pressure sensor interface(s) <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> and the circuit board <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The serial drive component <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> thereby allows the number of second connection points between the lead frame <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and the circuit board <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to be reduced from a one-to-one relationship with the number of first connection points between the plurality of solenoid coils <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and the lead frame. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The serial drive component <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> may be a microcontroller or an ASIC, for taking commands from the circuit board <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and performing fault detection functions. The serial communication allows this fault detection with fewer interconnects and greater speed than a one-to-one correspondence in connections. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The lead frame <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> further has a main connector <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> extending from the serial component <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> through the through bore <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the hydromechanical block <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to the first surface <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the circuit board <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The connector <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> preferably has a set of mechanical one-way connectors <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, such as non-soldered compliant pins, extending from a distal end of the connector of the lead frame <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The set of connectors <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> engages a corresponding set of apertures, or engagement holes <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, in the first surface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the circuit board <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The engagement holes <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are located adjacent an edge <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> of the first surface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the circuit board <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The connector <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> may be cylindrical (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>) or any other suitable shape. Due to the serial drive component <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, the connector <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> typically has two (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>), three (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>), or four (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) connectors <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> (i.e., the second connection points described above) for connecting to the circuit board <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The connector <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> transmits serial signals provided by the serial drive component <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> As viewed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the use of the non-soldered connectors <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> allows the lead frame <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to be easily mounted on the circuit board <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> subsequent to the mounting of the plurality of solenoid coils <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to the lead frame while also conserving space on the first surface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the circuit board. Alternatively, the connectors <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> may be solderable pins, as is known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The serial component <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> allows the connectors <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of the lead frame <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to be reduced from a one-to-one relationship to a total number of connectors <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of as few as two (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) for transferring control information between the solenoid coils/pressure sensor interface(s) <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> and the circuit board <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, as described above. The circuit board <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> thereby provides means for electrical communication and control and mechanical support to the lead frame <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, the plurality of solenoid coils <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, and the pressure sensor interface(s) <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>. Since the mechanical one-way connectors <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of the connector <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> plastically deform when inserted into the engagement holes <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the circuit board <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, no access to the second surface <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the circuit board is necessary for mounting the lead frame to the circuit board. This arrangement may allow the circuit board <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to be up to half the size of a circuit board utilizing the conventional arrangement (i.e., the solenoid coils or a lead frame mounted directly adjacent and opposite the circuit board). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The plurality of solenoid coils <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> are mechanically secured to valves <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> on the hydromechanical block <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, as is known in the art. The plurality of solenoid coils <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> controls actuation and operation of the valves <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> of the hydromechanical block <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The valves <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> control flow of the pressurized fluid provided by the motor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the pump. A cover, or lid <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, may be provided for the assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in order to protect the elements of the assembly from environmental conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> As viewed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, the connection of the connector <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> of lead frame <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> adjacent an edge <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> of the first surface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the circuit board <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> allows greater access to the other components than the conventional arrangement. The component <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> typically has a set of connectors, such as solderable connectors or non-soldered compliant pins (not shown). Other components (not shown) of the anti-lock braking system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be mounted to the second surface <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the circuit board <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in order to further conserve space and reduce the overall size of the circuit board and the entire anti-lock braking system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In accordance with one feature of the present invention, the assembly includes the electronic circuitry <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the solenoid coil devices <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, and the serial drive component <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. The serial drive component <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> electrically interconnects the electronic circuitry <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the solenoid coil devices <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The serial drive component <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> takes input from the first number of first connection points of the solenoid coil devices/pressure sensor interface(s) <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> (two each) and provides output to a second number of second connection points of the electronic circuitry <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (two, three, or four). Alternatively, the serial drive component <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> takes input from the second number of second connection points of the electronic circuitry <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (two, three, or four) and provides output to the first number of first connection points of the solenoid coil devices/pressure sensor interface(s) <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> (two each). The first number is thus greater than the second number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another feature of the present invention, the assembly includes the electronic circuitry <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the solenoid coil devices <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, and the component <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. The component <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> exchanges a plurality of signals between the first connections <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> to the solenoid coil devices <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> (two each) and one of the second connections to the electronic circuitry <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (one of the two, three, or four connectors <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In accordance with still another feature of the present invention, the assembly includes circuit means, coil means, and the means for electrically interconnecting the circuit means and the coil means. The interconnecting means takes input from the first number of first connection points of the coil means and provides output to the second number of second connection points of the circuit means. Alternatively, the interconnecting means takes input from the second number of second connection points of the circuit means and provides output to the first number of first connection points of the coil means. The first number is thus greater than the second number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The circuit means may be the circuit board <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> described above, a wiring harness, or other type of electrical routing arrangement. The coil means may be the solenoid coil(s) <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> described above or other electrical actuating device(s) for operating the hydraulic valves <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> of the anti-lock braking system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The interconnecting means may be the serial drive component <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> described above or other type of adapter for reducing electrical communication points while maintaining full communication and control therethrough. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In accordance with yet another feature of the present invention, a method is used to electrically control the anti-lock braking system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>.
