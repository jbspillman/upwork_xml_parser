<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to the field of patient sample measurement, and more particularly to a vessel having adjacent reaction wells which are effectively thermally isolated from one another, the vessel being utilized to perform multiple wet assays. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Reaction vessels or cuvettes are known in the field of &ldquo;wet&rdquo; chemistry clinical analysis systems for retaining a plurality of patient samples and other fluids for the preparation and conduction of various types of assays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> As described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,690,900 to Kimmo et al., these vessels typically include a support fixture having a plurality of adjacently disposed reaction wells, each of the wells being sized to retain a volume of a metered fluid, such as patient sample, diluent, reagent(s), and/or calibration fluids. As described in the above referred to &apos;900 patent, the fluid(s) retained in each of the reaction chambers can be tested as needed by apparatus, such as a spectrophotometer, through a transparent window provided in the side walls of the vessel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A problem generally known to those in the field of patient sample measurement is that heat transfer will take place between adjacent chambers of a reaction vessel which conducts multiple wet assays. Such thermal effects influence not only the confidence in testing using the vessel, but also the overall throughput of a clinical analysis apparatus used in conjunction therewith. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Therefore, there is a general need in the field to minimize the thermal effects between individual samples within a reaction vessel or cuvette; that is, to be able to thermally insulate the fluid contents within a vessel which contains a plurality of adjacently disposed reaction wells or chambers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> There is another general need in the field to improve the manner in which sample or other fluid is dispensed into one or more reaction chambers of a reaction vessel, such as those previously described above. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is a primary object of the present invention to overcome the above-noted problems associated with the prior art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is another primary object of the present invention to provide a reaction vessel or cuvette for processing of wet assays in which the fluid contents of adjacent reaction chambers of the vessel are thermally insulated from one another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It is yet another primary object of the present invention to provide a reaction vessel which permits greater controlled aspiration and dispensing of fluids used in the conduction of wet assays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It is still a further primary object of the present invention to provide greater throughput for clinical analytical apparatus in which wet assays are performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Therefore and according to a preferred aspect of the invention, there is provided a reaction vessel comprising: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> a) a frame including a plurality of vertically disposed reaction chambers held in spaced relation, each of said reaction chambers being sized for retaining a volume of at least one fluid; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> b) means disposed between at least two adjacent reaction chambers for thermally affecting the fluid contents thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The thermal affecting means according to a preferred embodiment includes at least one gap region which is defined between at least two adjacent reaction chambers of the reaction vessel. Preferably, the gap region includes at least one air or evacuated gap that prevents or at least substantially minimizes migratory or transient thermal effects to therefore provide improved insulation for the fluid contents of the vessel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> According to a preferred embodiment, the lower portion of each reaction chamber of the herein described vessel is smaller than the upper portion, the reaction chamber being sized to receive a fluid dispensing or aspirating member, such as a tapered disposable metering tip, which can aspirate fluid from or dispense fluid to a reaction chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the reaction chambers each include at least one pair of optically transmissive windows, preferably located in the lower portion of each reaction chamber of the vessel, which allows spectrophotometric or other form of optical testing to be performed on a retained fluid sample. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The thermal affecting means can also be used to conduct heat more readily to at least one reaction chamber of the herein described vessel. For example, an adapter block made from a thermally conductive material can be placed into at least one of the defined gap regions. When inserted into an incubator, thermal transfer readily occurs between the reaction chambers adjacent the gap region containing the thermally conductive adapter block. Alternately, the incubator can be configured to engage the gap regions of the reaction vessel directly so as to selectively apply heat directly to any number of thermal chambers of the vessel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> According to yet another preferred aspect of the invention, there is provided a reaction vessel for use in a clinical analyzer, said reaction vessel comprising a frame including a plurality of vertically disposed reaction chambers in spaced relation, each of said reaction chambers being sized for retaining a volume of fluid and means disposed between at least two of said chambers for thermally insulating the fluid contents in at least one pair of reaction chambers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the thermal insulating means can include at least one gap region disposed between at least one pair of the reaction chambers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In addition, at least one of the reaction chambers is sized to receive a fluid dispensing/aspirating member, such as a pipette tip in order to dispense fluid into a reaction chamber directly or to aspirate fluid therefrom. According to a preferred embodiment, the fluid dispensing/aspirating member is a disposable tapered metering tip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The cuvette is preferably made from a plastic material and includes at least one transparent window pair to permit optical testing of fluid sample contained in at least one of the reaction chambers of the vessel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> According to yet another preferred aspect of the present invention, there is provided a clinical analyzer comprising a wet chemistry analysis system and at least one reaction vessel for retaining at least one fluid sample. The reaction vessel includes a plurality of reaction chambers, each of the chambers having defined therebetween thermal affecting means which insulates the fluid contents of the reaction chambers or enables thermal transfer to occur readily to or between reaction chambers when used in conjunction with an incubator of the analyzer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> According to yet another preferred aspect of the invention, there is described a method for testing a patient sample, said method comprising the steps of: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> a) providing a reaction vessel having a plurality of adjacent reaction chambers, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> b) aspirating a fluid into a fluid aspirating/dispensing member; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> c) introducing said fluid aspirating/dispensing member into a lower portion of a reaction chamber; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> d) dispensing fluid directly into the lower portion of the reaction chamber of said vessel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Preferably, fluid, such as patient sample, reagents, or calibration liquids, can also be selectively aspirated from a reaction chamber, also preferably using a fluid aspirating/dispensing member, such as a tapered metering tip, which is lowered into a reaction chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> An advantageous feature of the present invention is that multiple fluid volumes which are contained within a reaction vessel in separate reaction chambers of the vessel can be thermally isolated from one another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Another advantage of the present invention is that each of the reaction chambers of the reaction vessel can be used to receive a metering tip to either aspirate or dispense sample or other fluids therefrom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Yet another advantage of the present invention is that overall throughput can be effectively increased using a reaction vessel, such as described herein, in a clinical analyzing apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> These and other objects, features, and advantages will become readily apparent from the following Detailed Description which should be read in conjunction with the following drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The following description relates to certain preferred embodiments of a reaction vessel or cuvette, preferably for use with an automated clinical analyzer. Throughout the course of discussion, it will be readily apparent to one of sufficient skill that there are various modifications and variations which embody the inventive concepts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, and for purposes of background there is first described a prior art reaction vessel <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the vessel including a plurality of adjacently spaced reaction wells or chambers <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The vessel <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> permits optical testing of the fluid contents contained within the reaction wells <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> using an apparatus <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which according to this embodiment is a spectrophotometer or other device capable of measuring an optical property through the side walls of the vessel. Each of the reaction wells <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the vessel <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are generally uniform rectangular sections which include an open top or upper end <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and a bottom wall <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, each of the reaction wells being separated from one another by respective walls <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of plastic material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Referring now to FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, there is described a reaction vessel <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> made in accordance with a first preferred embodiment of the present invention. The reaction vessel <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> includes a support frame <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, manufactured preferably from a moldable plastic such as polystyrene, acrylic, polyamide, polycarbonate, or other similar material. Though plastic makes the cuvette <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the vessel could also be made from other materials such as glass or metal. The support frame <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of adjacent open-ended reaction wells or chambers <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, each of which in a preferred embodiment are equally spaced in relation to one another. According to the present embodiment, six (6) reaction chambers <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are provided, though it will be appreciated that this number can be suitably varied depending on the application or use of the vessel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The support frame <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> according to this particular embodiment is rectangular in shape and defined by a pair of side walls <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, and a pair of opposing end walls <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. Each of the reaction chambers <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are defined by a substantially cylindrical cross section and include an open-ended upper portion <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and a narrower lower portion <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> including a bottom wall <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The upper and lower portions <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of each interior reaction chamber <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> include interior opposing end walls <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> which are substantially parallel to one another, with the exception of a tapered portion <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> linking the upper and lower portions together. The exterior reaction chambers of the vessel <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> include one interior end wall <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> and an end wall <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. In addition, the reaction chambers <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> according to this present embodiment are sized to accommodate a fluid aspirating/dispensing member <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. In this instance, the fluid aspirating/dispensing member <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is a tapered disposable metering tip <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, such as those manufactured by Johnson and Johnson Company under the trade name Vitros though it should be apparent to one of sufficient skill that other forms of pipette tips can alternately be substituted using the inventive concepts of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> It should or will become readily apparent that the need for the tapered portion <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is based, in large part, on the geometry of the tip <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and is not essential if other tips are used. Furthermore, other shapes of the vessel <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> could be assumed rather than only rectangular. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The end walls <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> of each of the reaction chambers <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are thickened to support the weight of the fluid volume and are formed using conventional molding techniques. In addition, the side walls <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the plastic support frame <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the herein described reaction vessel <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> also form the side walls for each of the reaction chambers <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. At least a portion <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of each of the side walls <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is made optically transparent to permit light to be transmitted through the lower portion <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of each reaction chamber <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and permit optical testing of a retained fluid sample, using for example, a spectrophotometer, such as that shown partially in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, above. Details relating to this form of testing are provided in U.S. Pat. No. 4,690,900, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein. The entirety of the support frame <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, including the interior end walls <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> are preferably transparent, though it should be realized that this is not essential. In fact, if required, each of the interior end walls <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> or other portions of the vessel could be made to form a light lock to prevent light transmissibility between interior chambers <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Due to the disparity in size between that of the narrowed lower portion <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and the upper portion <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of each of the reaction chambers <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> according to this embodiment, a gap region <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is formed between each pair of adjacent interior reaction chambers <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. According to the present embodiment, a total of five (5) gap regions <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> are provided, each having a tapered shape or cross section. In addition, smaller gap regions <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> are provided between each of the end walls <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and each end reaction chamber <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> According to this embodiment, the disposable metering tip <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> can aspirate patient sample from a supply (not shown) through use of a conventional metering system (not shown) including a probocsis and a metering transport rail. Alternately, the sample could be supplied manually. The tip <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> can then be placed directly into a reaction chamber <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> such that the dispense end of the tip is placed directly into the lower portion <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> for dispensing of the liquid. The tip <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> can then be withdrawn and discarded or washed. A new tip (not shown) can then aspirate additional fluids, such as reagent or calibration fluids which can also be dispensed into the reaction well <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> for conduction of the assay. The cuvette <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> can then be inserted into an incubator (not shown) and the fluid contents can be optically read in accordance to the protocol of the assay being performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The present reaction vessel <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is a single use cuvette. Therefore, the reaction vessel <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, following conduction of the multiple assays and testing thereof, can be discarded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the gap regions can assume other geometries, such as those shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>, among others. It should be readily apparent that these illustrations are not exhaustive as numerous gap designs are possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Referring back to FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the gap regions <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> of the herein described reaction vessel <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> contain air which serves to insulate the contents between adjacent lower portions <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of the reaction chambers <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of the reaction vessel <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Alternately, each of the gap regions <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> could be evacuated in order to create a vacuum to vary the amount of thermal insulation between adjacent reaction chambers <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The smaller gap regions <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> serve a separate function to thermally isolate the cuvette from the heated end surfaces of incubator (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The reaction vessel can also be used to otherwise thermally affect the fluid contents of any of the reaction wells <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6, a</cross-reference> reaction vessel or cuvette <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> made in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention is herein described. As in the preceding, the reaction vessel <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> includes a support frame <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> which is defined by a plurality of adjacent reaction chambers <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>.
