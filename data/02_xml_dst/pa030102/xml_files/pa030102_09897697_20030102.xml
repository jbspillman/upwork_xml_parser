<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> A field of the invention is methods for printing documents. Other fields of the invention include print data services, wireless portable devices, and web based services. More specifically, the present invention is related to methods for printing documents from portable devices. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Traditional models for print operation comprise the &ldquo;pushing&rdquo; of content to a printer from a device. Most often, this involves a computer communicating with a print device. The communication may follow the format of a hard-wired connection interface, such as when a print device connects to a computer over a serial or parallel computer port. The communication might also follow a wireless connection such as that used for communication through an infrared light or radio frequency port. The basic operation in either case involves a device, e.g., a computer, linking to a print device, converting content into a format acceptable to the print device, and then transferring the data to the print device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> As an example, a computer printing a Microsoft Word document addresses a printer, converts the document data and format information into a printer ready format, and pushes the print content to the printer. The communication between the printer and the device is formatted according to protocols. Print servers that typically comprise software resident or cooperative with a data generating program translate the data into a printer format and otherwise convert print job data into a protocol useful for control of the print job. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Traditional printing models limit print operations in a number of disadvantageous manners. For example, one limitation relates to an inability of a printer to be used by devices lacking means for converting data into a printer ready format. While this limitation may potentially be overcome by equipping the device with a driver capable of translating the data, this is often impractical due to the number or size of drivers required to accommodate a variety of printers and print jobs. This is particularly true for devices having limited memory resources, such as portable devices like personal digital assistants (PDAs), cell phones, wireless data terminals, laptop computers, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> These devices are faced with still additional limitations in traditional printing models. Specifically, limited memory resources not only pose problems for storage of printer drivers, but likewise pose problems for storing content to be printed. Recent popularity of data files requiring relatively high memory resources such as graphics and photos, for instance, has further contributed to these problems. A proposed solution to these problems has been the addition of memory resources to the devices. This solution disadvantageously increases the cost, size, and weight of these devices, however. Additionally, even if these devices had the capacity to store more and larger data files for printing, they may face disadvantages associated with speed and reliability of communicating relatively large data files to a printer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Advances in wireless communications have made these and other problems in the art more critical. Many portable devices such as cellular phones and PDA&apos;s can now communicate with one another as well as networked resources for widespread applications. By way of example, wireless communications may allow a user to connect with the Internet from a PDA or cell phone and surf websites. Content from these websites could be selected and downloaded to the portable device, and later communicated to a printer for printing. The problems discussed above, however, as well as others in the art have limited the practicality of such methods as the portable devices generally lack memory and communications resources for downloading, storing, and printing relatively large files. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Unresolved needs in the art therefore exist. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention comprises a method for printing by reference in which portable devices are able to cause the printing of data stored at a remote location by passing a reference to the data to a print device for processing. In essence, an aspect of one embodiment the present invention thereby generally comprises steps through which print content is &ldquo;pulled&rdquo; to a print device from a location, in contrast to traditional print models that &ldquo;push&rdquo; the data to the print device. One embodiment of the method of the invention generally comprises the steps of establishing a wireless communication link between a portable device and a print device, communicating a reference from the portable device, the reference indicating at least a location having print content, and printing the print content with the print device. Preferably, the reference comprises at least a network address. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> By way of additional summary, four example embodiments for practice of the method of the invention are presented. Each of these four example embodiments has in common that a portable device is used to initiate a print by reference process. In a first and preferred embodiment, the method further comprises communicating the reference from the portable device to the print device, and from the print device to a print server. The print server then communicates with the network location corresponding to the reference to obtain the print content, which is then communicated to the print device for printing. Preferably, additional steps of the print server discovering print device capabilities and formatting the print content according to those capabilities are comprised. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A second example embodiment of the method of the invention also comprises steps that make use of a print server. In this embodiment, the portable device communicates the reference to the print server, which then communicates with a network location corresponding to the reference. The print server obtains the print content from the network location, with the print device subsequently obtaining the print content for printing. As with the first example embodiment, the print server preferably discovers the print device capabilities and formats the print content according to these capabilities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Third and fourth example method embodiments do not comprise use of print servers. In the third example embodiment, the method comprises communicating the reference to the print device, which then communicates with the location corresponding to the reference to obtain the print content for printing. In this embodiment, the print device may comprise internal print server functionality. In the fourth example embodiment, the reference comprises at least a network address corresponding to the print content, and the portable device communicates this network address to a network whereby a communications link is established between the portable device and the print content location. Print content from the location is then transmitted through the portable device to the print device for printing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> These and other embodiments of the method of the invention thereby solve many otherwise unresolved problems in the art in an elegant and novel manner. For example, portable devices are able to direct the printing of print content regardless of memory resources of the portable device. That is, because the data is not required to be downloaded and completely stored in a memory of the portable device, disadvantages associated with limited memory resources are minimized. Additionally, in method embodiments such as the first and second examples that comprise communicating between the print device and the print content location, the print content never passes through the portable device. Disadvantages associated with low speed communications from the portable device are therefore overcome. Finally, in method embodiments where print content is pulled to the print device, problems associated with pushing data through firewalls are resolved. These and many other advantages of the present invention will be appreciated by those knowledgeable in the art through the detailed method description that follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The above brief description sets forth broadly some of the more important features and advantages of the present disclosure so that the detailed description that follows may be better understood, and so that the present contributions to the art may be better appreciated. There are, of course, additional features of the disclosure that will be described hereinafter that form the subject matter of the claims appended hereto. In this respect, before explaining embodiments of the disclosure in detail, it is to be understood that the disclosure is not limited in its application to the details as set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings. The present invention may provide additional embodiments, as will be appreciated by those knowledgeable in the art. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein are for description and not limitation.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Turning now to the drawings, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a schematic useful in illustrating a first example embodiment of a method of the invention. In this embodiment, a portable wireless device such as a PDA <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> establishes a wireless communication link <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> with a print device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The communications link <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> established between the PDA <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the print device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> preferably supports two-way dialogue between the devices. That is, the preferred communications link <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> will allow for both the PDA <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the print device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to send and receive data between one another. Data may be in any practical format, with digital data comprising discrete packets a preferred example. Once the link <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> has been established, the print device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> preferably acknowledges the PDA <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to provide confirmation that the link <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is operable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Wireless communication link <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may be established using any practical wireless technology, with preferred examples comprising infrared light and radio frequency. Both the PDA <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and print device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> preferably comprise ports for communicating via the link <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. A preferred technology comprises a relatively low power radio frequency that has an operable range of less than about 10 meters. Protocols having other operable ranges may be useful for practice of the invention, with a range of less than about 300 meters an additional example. An example of a preferred commercially available wireless technology is the &ldquo;Bluetooth&rdquo; RF protocol that allows computer and other electronic devices to communicate over relatively short distances. Bluetooth is a wireless standard developed by a technology industry consortium made up of 3Com, Ericsson, IBM, Intel, Agere, Microsoft, Motorola, Nokia, and Toshiba with a mission of creating a standard wireless protocol. More information, including protocol specifications, can be obtained on the Bluetooth website: www.bluetooth.com, with the content available from this and linked websites incorporated herein by reference. The current Bluetooth protocol has an operable range of about 10 meters. Other example protocols suitable for practice within the scope of the invention that have available commercial support are those specified by IEEE 802.11 standard. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> An additional subset of method steps of an embodiment of the invention comprise a discovery process by the client PDA <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> used to locate one or more print devices. In this subset of steps, the PDA <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may communicate a discovery signal for locating available print devices within operable range of the PDA <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the discovery signal comprises location data for the PDA <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, which may be obtained through use of positioning tools or the like, with an example comprising satellite or beacon triangulation tools. A print device may respond to the discovery signal with information that includes the location of the print device, directions to get from the PDA <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> location to the print device, cost for using the print device; current wait time for the print device; capabilities of the print device such as color printing, two sided printing, paper types; and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Further, a plurality of print devices may be within operable range of the PDA <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, in which case the embodiment will further comprise each of the plurality of print devices responding to the discovery signal with data that will allow the PDA user to choose between the print devices. By way of example, the user may choose a print device based on proximity, wait time, cost of use, capabilities such as two-sided or color printing, or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Once the communications link <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> has been established between the PDA <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the print device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, this first method example embodiment comprises a step of communicating a reference from the PDA <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> via the link <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to the print device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. &ldquo;Reference&rdquo; as used herein is intended to broadly refer to a data set. Preferably, a reference as practiced with the current invention comprises at least a network address corresponding to a network accessible location from which the desired print content is available. The reference may also comprise additional data. Also, the reference may further comprise an indicator or be presented in a protocol that will be recognized by a receiving device such as the print device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> as indicating that a &ldquo;print by reference&rdquo; print job should be initiated. As an example, a reference may be communicated in a particular protocol, or may comprise a command, character string, syntax, or the like that when received will be recognized as a &ldquo;print by reference&rdquo; communication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The PDA <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may obtain the reference in any of a number of steps. For example, the PDA <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may be connected via a cellular connection to the Internet, and may be used to surf websites. A website may be encountered having print content that is desired to be output, such as a product brochure. This print content may have a &ldquo;reference&rdquo; associated with it, with the reference obtained by the PDA <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> without obtaining all of the print content. In practice, the print content may have a &ldquo;Print by Reference&rdquo; or similar icon for selection that when selected communicates the reference. By way of additional example, a reference may be manually entered to the PDA <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, or may be received via a beacon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The network address that the preferred reference comprises may be any suitable data string useful for identifying a location on a network. Examples comprise &ldquo;pure&rdquo; Internet protocol address strings, uniform resource locator (&ldquo;URL&rdquo;) such as are used to identify locations on the worldwide web, and the like. By way of additional description, if a reference were obtained for obtaining print content from an Internet based location, the reference may comprise a URL Internet address. The reference used in the method of the invention may of course comprise more than a network location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> For example, additional data included within the reference may comprise information regarding the data to be printed, such as the file size, the number of pages, the format, the colors, the dates of creation, the application used to create the data, print instructions and settings for various printers, and the like. Other reference information may further comprise alternative access path information, security information such as encryption keys or instructions, access information, and the like. Additionally, a single reference may comprise a plurality of individual print content locations and information sets. In this manner a single reference could be communicated for printing from a plurality of print content locations. Preferably, a reference comprising additional information is provided as an XML (extensible markup language) tag including Meta information. For example, the XML tag may have syntax that permits inclusion of print job meta information, a list of references with each reference indicating a location of print content, and/or identification of a print server location of a server. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In this first example embodiment, the print device is preferably connectable to a network illustrated for convenience in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> as a &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, with a print server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> accessible via the network <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. The print server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> as a &ldquo;box&rdquo; for illustration purposes. Those knowledgeable in the art will appreciate that the print server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> in practice may comprise any of a number of processor based server devices, such as a computer, or may comprise a set of programmed instructions being executed by a processor based device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Once the print device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> has received the reference from the PDA <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, it establishes a server communications link <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> with the print server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> over the network <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the print server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> acknowledges the print device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> over the server link <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> once established. Server link <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> may be established by any means as may be practical, including but not limited to wired and wireless communications. The print device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> may have a network address for the print server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> stored in a print device memory. Also, an additional step of an embodiment of the invention may comprise including a print server address and access information in the reference, and a step comprising the print device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> examining the reference to determine the print server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> address. Further, a plurality of print servers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be operatively accessible over the network <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, with a corresponding plurality of addresses stored in the print device memory or comprised in the reference. The print device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> may then establish the server link <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> with whichever of the plurality of the print servers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> that may be preferred for reasons such as availability, congestion, proximity, or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In the first example embodiment, the reference is passed from the print device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to the print server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> over the server link <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> for resolution. &ldquo;Resolution of a reference&rdquo; as used herein is intended to broadly refer to general steps of processing the reference, which may generally include steps of extracting information from the reference and acting on that information. Resolution may comprise, by way of example, recognizing the reference as indicating that a print by reference print job should be initiated, examining the reference to determine data contained therein, extracting particular data from the reference such as a network address, and taking steps required to locate and obtain the desired print content corresponding to the reference. Accordingly, with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, after receiving the reference, the print server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> will examine the reference to determine a network address for the location <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> having the print content stored thereon, and will communicate with the location <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> via a communications link <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> over the network <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that the method may comprise steps of resolving the reference with other elements than with the print server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. By way of example, the reference could be resolved by the print device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, with only required information from the reference then transmitted to the print server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Or, the reference could be resolved by the PDA <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, with only required information then transmitted to the print device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and the print server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Additionally, the reference may be resolved by any combination of the PDA <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the print device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, and/or the print server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, with each of the respective devices extracting a portion of the data of the reference and performing various steps using the thus extracted data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The location having the desired print content available has been illustrated for example purposes in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> as the computer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. It will be appreciated by those knowledgeable in the art that the method of the invention can be practiced with a wide variety of &ldquo;locations&rdquo; having print content. By way of example, a preferred location comprises at least a file with a URL assigned thereto for access over the Internet. Thus the location as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> preferably comprises one or more data files stored in a memory of the computer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Further embodiment steps comprise the print server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> obtaining the print content from the location <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> over the communication link <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and communicating the print content to the print device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> for printing via the server link <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the steps of communicating the print content from the print server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to the print device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> comprise a &ldquo;pulling&rdquo; of the content by the print device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, as opposed to a &ldquo;pushing&rdquo; of the content from the server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. By way of example, the print server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may create and assign a new URL to the print content, with this new URL indicated to the print device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The print device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> could then &ldquo;pull&rdquo; the data from the new URL. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Further, additional steps of the print server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> formatting the print content for the print device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> are preferably comprised in the method of the invention. For this preferred print server functionality, the method of the invention may comprise additional preferred steps of obtaining print device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> capabilities from the print device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> via the server link <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. As used herein, the term &ldquo;print device capabilities&rdquo; is intended to broadly refer to information relating to the performance and specifications of a print device that may be required to format data for printing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> By way of example, print device capabilities as used herein may indicate what fonts and character sets a print device supports, what languages it supports, what sizes and types of materials may be printed on, what color and graphic capabilities, and the like. With knowledge of these print device capabilities, the print server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> will be able to format the print content as may be desired for printing by the print device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the print server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> supports formatting of print content in formats that comprise at least HTML (hyper text markup language), XHTML (extensible hypertext markup language), PDF (portable document file), and US ASCII (American standard code for information interchange) formats. These formats are generally known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Print device capabilities may exist as a stand alone file that is passed from the print device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to the print server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, may comprise information that is &ldquo;appended&rdquo; or added to the reference passed from the print device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to the print server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, or may comprise information that is discovered by the print server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> through a dialog with the print device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> via the server linkage <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. By way of still an additional example, the print device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> may pass an identifier such as a model number to the print server, which then may determine print device capabilities through steps of obtaining a profile stored locally or remotely over the network <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In a still additional preferred subset of steps of the method of the invention, the print server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, the server link <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, the print device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, the wireless link <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and the PDA <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are all provided with functionality such that the PDA <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> can display print job status information and can perform print job control functions. By way of example, an embodiment of the invention comprises steps of making a status indicator available to the PDA <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> during performance of the print by reference job. Upon inquiry, then, the user of the PDA <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> could learn for instance that the print content location <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> had been contacted, that the print content was in the process of transfer to the print server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> or the print device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, was in the process of formatting by the print server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, or the like. Further, ratios of completion are preferably made available, so that for instance the PDA user can determine that the job is &ldquo;20% completed&rdquo;, and the like. Examples of providing print job control functions comprise providing print job pause and print job cancel functionality from the PDA <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Through this first example embodiment of the invention, a document <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is ultimately printed corresponding to print content residing at a location <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> that is remote from the PDA <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Importantly, the print content has been printed without requiring storage in the memory resources of the PDA <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Additionally, the print content is printed without ever passing &ldquo;through&rdquo; the PDA <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Thus many of the problems in the art related to memory and communications resource limitations are thereby resolved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Additionally, this first method embodiment provides important advantages in terms of obtaining print content through security mechanisms such as firewalls. In particular, it may be difficult to &ldquo;push&rdquo; data through firewalls. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> by way of example, if a security firewall stood between the print device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and the network <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, problems may be encountered in directing print content from the network <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> to be printed at the print device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> via a traditional &ldquo;push&rdquo; model. Through the first example embodiment, however, these problems would be solved as firewalls generally would allow for content to be &ldquo;pulled&rdquo; therethrough as occurs through the first example embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a schematic useful for illustration of a second example embodiment of the method of the invention. This second example embodiment is generally similar to the first example embodiment, with an important difference in that this example comprises steps of the print server <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and the print device <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> communicating through the PDA <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. That is, this second embodiment is different than the first in that there is no &ldquo;direct&rdquo; communication between the print device <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and the print server <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. This second embodiment may be preferred over the first if, for example, the print device <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> had the ability to communicate over short distances with the PDA <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, but was otherwise not operably connected to the network <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. As a further example, this example embodiment may be useful for practice with printers that are not network connected, but that have or may be equipped with a short-range communications portal for establishing a short range communications link with a portable device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Because the first and second example embodiments have several steps and elements that are substantially similar to one another, description of these steps and elements may not be repeated in the same detail as was done for the first example embodiment for the sake of brevity. Accordingly, discussion of these elements and steps made in regards to the first example embodiment will be understood to apply to this second example embodiment as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In this second example embodiment, the PDA <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> establishes a wireless communications link <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> with the print device <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. The wireless link <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is substantially the same as the link <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> described with reference to the first example embodiment, including its preferred elements and in particular the preferred Bluetooth protocol. Once the link <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> has been established, the print device <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> preferably acknowledges the PDA <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. This second example embodiment further comprises steps of the PDA <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> establishing a server communications link <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> with a print server <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the server link <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> comprises a wireless linkage such as an infrared or radio frequency protocol signal. The link <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is preferably capable of relatively long range communications, with a preferred example comprising cellular protocol radio frequency. The print server <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> may be located by the PDA <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> through any of a number of method steps, with examples comprising determining a network address for the print server <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> from a reference, from a location stored in a memory of the print device <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, from a registry or list that is accessible over the network <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, from a search of the network <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> This second example embodiment further comprises steps of transmitting a reference corresponding to the desired print content to a network accessible print server <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> over the link <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. It will be appreciated that the reference of this second example embodiment is substantially the same as the reference described in regards to the first example embodiment. That is, the reference preferably comprises at least a network address for a location where the desired print content available from, and may comprise additional information such as information regarding the nature of the print content, security information, access information, print server addresses, and the like. The reference further comprises an indicator to the print server <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> that a print by reference job is to be initiated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The print server <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> resolves the reference in substantially the same manner as does the print server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> as described in regards to the first example embodiment. That is, the print server <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> determines the network address of the location having the desired print content available, establishes a communications link <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> with the location, and obtains the desired print content. It will be appreciated that this second example embodiment may further comprise additional steps of print server <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> reference resolution as described in regards to the print server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of the first example embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Likewise, it will be appreciated that this example embodiment may comprise additional steps of print content formatting by the print server <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> as described with reference to the print server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of the first example embodiment. In particular, this second example may preferably comprise steps of PDA <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> obtaining print device capabilities for print device <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> via the wireless link <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, and transmitting this profile via the server link <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> to the print server <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. It will be understood that &ldquo;print device capabilities&rdquo; as used in regards to this second example embodiment is intended to be consistent with use in regards to the first example. That is, printer capabilities generally comprise specifications for the print device <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> that will allow the print server <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> to format the print content for printing. Additionally, print device capabilities may be appended or inserted into the reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Also, this example embodiment may comprise transmitting print device capabilities stored in a memory of the print device <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, or may comprise steps of performing a discovery process by the PDA <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> over the link <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. By way of additional example, steps of obtaining an identifier for the print device <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> such as a print device model number over the link <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> may be comprised, followed by steps of using the identifier to obtain a print device profile from a remote source over the network <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Once formatted for printing by the print server <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, the print content is preferably streamed by the print server through the PDA <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> via the server link <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, and subsequently over the link <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> to the print device <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> for ultimate printing of a document <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the print content is streamed in a manner such that it does not require memory resources of the PDA <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. Or, streaming may occur using data flow control steps that at least minimize use of the PDA <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> memory resources. For example, data may be obtained in portions, with a single portion buffered in the PDA <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> memory and then streamed on to the print device <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Also, the print content data is preferably communicated to the PDA <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> via a pulling mechanism that comprises the PDA <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> requesting or otherwise getting the content from the server <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, as opposed to the server <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> pushing the content to the PDA <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. Like the first example embodiment, this second embodiment may also further comprise additional steps of providing functionality between the print server <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, the PDA <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, the print device <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, the server link <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, and the wireless link <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> to allow for status update and print process control to the PDA <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. For example, additional embodiment steps comprise providing functionality that allows the PDA <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> to report print job status such as completion portion, and to maintain print job control such as job pause and cancel capabilities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Third and fourth example embodiments are similar to the first and second examples, with an important difference in the steps for communicating print content to the print device. As illustrated by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, respectively, these third and fourth example embodiments instead generally comprise direct communication between a print device <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and the network location <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> having the desired print content, and between the PDA <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and the network location <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that many of the steps and elements of these third and fourth example embodiments are substantially the same as those of the first and second example embodiments, and will therefore not be described in great detail. It will therefore further be appreciated that the description of various steps and elements, including but not limited to preferred embodiments, made in regards to the first and second example embodiments likewise apply to these third and fourth embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is useful in illustrating the third example embodiment. This embodiment comprises steps of establishing a wireless link <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, which most preferably comprises a short range radio frequency link such as a Bluetooth protocol link, between a PDA <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and a print device <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the print device <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> acknowledges the PDA <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> over the link <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> once established. Further steps comprise communicating a reference from the PDA <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> over the link <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> to the print device <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. The reference is substantially the same in this third embodiment as that described in regards to the first and second embodiments. In general, it preferably comprises at least a network address corresponding to desired print content, and may comprise additional data such as meta-tags providing access, security, and print content information, and further preferably comprises an indicator that a print by reference job is to be initiated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In this third example embodiment, the reference is resolved by the print device <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. Steps of reference resolution comprise the print device <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> examining the reference to determine the location <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> for obtaining the print content, establishing a communications link <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> over the network <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> with the location <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, obtaining the print content, and finally printing the print content in the form of document <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>. The print device <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> may further perform steps of formatting the print content in accordance with the print device <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> printing capabilities. In effect, then, this third example embodiment may comprise combining the functionality of the print server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> as described in regards to the first and second example embodiments with the print device <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In practice, for example, the print server functionality may be provided in the form of programmed instruction sets or circuitry components that are loaded or connected to the print device <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. By way of further example, print server logic may be encoded onto a circuit card plugged into an expansion bus of the print device <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, may be encoded into circuitry present in a chipset connected to a print device circuit, or may be contained in an executable program instruction set that is stored in a print device memory for execution by a print device processor. The dashed &ldquo;box&rdquo; <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> in the print device <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> is intended to illustrate a print server sub-component of the print device <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. This third example embodiment accordingly comprises additional steps of the print device <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> resolving the reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Also, this third example embodiment may find utility for practice where the print server functionality was of limited need. By way of example, the network location <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> may offer print content in a number of formats that correspond to different printers, with each of the formats having a different reference. A reference corresponding to the print content in a format compatible with the particular print device <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> could be obtained by the PDA <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, with that reference then passed to the print device <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. The print device <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> would then resolve the reference to obtain pre-formatted print content for output. Those knowledgeable in the art will appreciate that other circumstances may of course likewise make the practice of this third example embodiment preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Like the third example embodiment, the fourth example does not make use of a print server, but instead comprises direct communication between a PDA <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and a print content location <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>. Like other example embodiments, this fourth example embodiment comprises a step of the PDA <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> establishing a wireless link <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> with the print device <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>, and preferably of the print device <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> acknowledging the PDA <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> over the link <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. Further steps are comprised of the PDA establishing a communications link <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> with the location <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> having the desired print content. The link <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> preferably comprises a long-range wireless communications protocol, with a cellular based radio frequency a preferred example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In this fourth example embodiment, the reference preferably comprises a network address, and the PDA <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> itself preferably resolves the reference by communicating the reference network address to the network <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>. The reference of this embodiment may comprise additional information as described in regards to other embodiments. Because the print device <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> doesn&apos;t resolve the reference in this example embodiment, the print device <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> is not required to have print server functionality. Indeed, this example embodiment may find utility for practice with substantially &ldquo;standard&rdquo; printers that may be obtained at relatively low cost. The printer <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> is required, of course, to have wireless capabilities for communicating with the PDA <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The print content is preferably streamed through the PDA <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> to the print device <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>. Streaming is preferably accomplished through steps as described with reference to the second example. That is, preferably no or minimal memory resources of the PDA <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> are required. Because no print server is comprised in this example embodiment, print data is preferably preformatted for the particular capabilities of the print device <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>. Also, additional steps may be comprised of the PDA discovering the print device <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> capabilities, and performing formatting functions. Still additionally, after a step of discovering the print device <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> capabilities, the PDA <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> may be used to select from a plurality of pre-formatted print content files at the location <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> for content that is pre-formatted to match the print device <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> capabilities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> It is noted that the example embodiments of the present invention discussed herein and illustrated with FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> have referred to various steps performed by a &ldquo;PDA&rdquo;. It will be understood that reference to a &ldquo;PDA&rdquo; has been made herein for purposes of example only, and that the present invention is not limited to practice with a PDA, and indeed will find utility with use of a variety of portable electronic devices. In addition to PDA&apos;s, preferred examples comprise portable computers, wireless communications devices such as radios and cellular phones, portable data terminals, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Additionally, it will be understood that although discussion herein has made reference to method steps for performance by a &ldquo;print device&rdquo; which has been illustrated in corresponding FIGS. with a printer, the present invention is of course not limited to use with printers. For example, the various invention embodiments will find utility when practiced with other document production apparatuses, such as copiers, facsimile machines, scanners, multi-function devices, and the like. Additionally, invention embodiments may be of utility for use with devices that do not produce documents. By way of example, invention embodiments may be used to record a print content file to a memory of a computer or the like, without production of a document. Accordingly, it will be understood that the term &ldquo;printer device&rdquo; as used herein is not limited to printers, but instead broadly refers to devices for producing documents and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Also, it will be appreciated that the method of the present invention may be practiced as comprising additional steps of a PDA contacting a network location and downloading the reference that corresponds to the print content therefrom. Additionally, references may be available from other sources, such as stored on portable memory means. By way of example, product literature may have a reference stored on a portable memory medium that could be distributed for promotional purposes. The reference from this memory medium could be communicated to a portable device such as a PDA, with the reference then resolvable to ultimately obtain the promotional literature in printed form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Those knowledgeable in the art will also appreciate that embodiments of the method of the invention may comprise additional steps related to facilitating billing for a print by reference process. The reference may be provided as comprising information useful for billing purposes. For example, the reference may identify a content provider, so that when processed the content provider would be able to be identified for payment. Further, identification information for the PDA user may be appended to the reference, so that when communicated and processed a user can be charged. A charge number such as a credit card or other account identifier may be required to be added to the reference by the user before the reference can be processed. Those knowledgeable in the art will appreciate that embodiments of the method of the invention may comprise many additional steps for providing data to enable billing that may generally comprise user identification, content provider identification, content identification, time of processing, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> It will also be appreciated that various communications links described herein, such as links <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>, although described as &ldquo;direct&rdquo; need not be direct point to point linkages. Indeed, it will be appreciated by those knowledgeable in the art that some forms of network communication, particularly wide networks such as the internet, generally support communications links that pass through a variety of nodes, servers, links, and the like between their origination and final destination. Accordingly, as used herein the term &ldquo;direct&rdquo; when applied to communications links and the like is not intended to be limited to direct point to point communications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> It will also be appreciated that the present invention may be practiced in the form of a system. Accordingly, an additional embodiment of the present invention comprises a system for printing content. With reference made once again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an embodiment of a system of the invention comprises a portable device <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> linked via a wireless communications link <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to a print device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The print device in turn is connectable to a network <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. The portable device <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> communicates a reference to the print device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, with the reference indicating at least a location connectable to the network having print content. The print device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> obtains the print content from the location, and prints the print content. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the system further comprises a print server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> connectable to the network, with the reference further comprising a print server address. The print device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> then communicates the reference to the print server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, which obtains the print content. More preferably, the print device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> communicates print device capabilities to the print server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, which then formats the print content for printing by the print device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> It will likewise be appreciated that various embodiments of the present invention lend themselves well to practice in the form of computer program products. It will therefore be understood that the present invention may comprise one or more computer program products comprising computer executable instructions embedded in a computer readable medium such as a magnetic, electronic, or optical media, that when executed by a processor in a machine cause the machine to execute various steps as described herein in reference to method embodiments. For example, an embodiment of the present invention may comprise a computer program product comprising programmable instructions residing on a printer, a PDA, a print server, and/or a network server or client computer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The advantages of the disclosed invention are thus attained in an economical, practical, and facile manner. While preferred embodiments and example configurations have been shown and described, it is to be understood that various further modifications and additional configurations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. It is intended that the specific embodiments and configurations herein disclosed are illustrative of the preferred and best modes for practicing the invention, and should not be interpreted as limitations on the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. </paragraph>
