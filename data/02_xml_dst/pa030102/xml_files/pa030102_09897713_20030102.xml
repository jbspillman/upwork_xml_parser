<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">In a method and apparatus for converting optical wavelength division multiplexed channels to wireless channels, the information carrying optical carriers are first demultiplexed and each optical carrier is then extracted from the data using an optical channelizing technique. The optical frequency of each of the extracted optical carriers is then shifted by an amount equal to the desired wireless carrier frequencies in the broadband wireless channels. Optical heterodyning of the frequency-shifted extracted lightwave carriers with the original data-containing optical signals, which are mutually in phase coherence, in a photodetector results in a set of wireless carriers each modulated with the data carried by the corresponding optical channel. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to converting optical data signals to radio frequency data signals. More specifically, the present invention relates to converting broadband data transmitted on optical carriers in conventional wavelength-division-multiplexed (WDM) networks to corresponding microwave or millimeter wave carriers that support the continued broadband transmission of the data. </paragraph>
</section>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) is a basic technology of networking optical signals. It is a technique by which a single fiber is used to carry many separate and independent optical channels. Each channel within the optical wavelength division multiplexed (OWDM) network is assigned a separate optical wavelength at which it is transmitted through the network. In a &ldquo;sparse&rdquo; OWDM system, the optical wavelengths are (relatively) widely separated. For example, two optical wavelengths of 1300 nm and 1550 nm may be used in a sparse system. Such a system has an advantage of being easily implemented, but a major disadvantage is the limited number of optical channels that can be carried. In a &ldquo;dense&rdquo; OWDM system, the optical wavelengths are closely spaced. In a typical dense optical wavelength division multiplexed (DOWDM) system, the channel spacing may be as small as 1 nm or less. DOWDM systems provide substantially more channels than a sparse system, but are also more complex and difficult to implement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> OWDM technology provides the ability, in a given network, to allocate different services (or area of coverage) to different optical wavelengths for direct addressing. One example is in hybrid fiber coax WDM technology, where each service (broadcast video, pay per view, etc.) or different housing communities are routed by a designated wavelength in a Passive Optical Network (PON) architecture. Allocation of different services to different wavelengths simplifies the distribution of these services via optical networks, since the distribution hardware used in the networks does not need to know the type of service carried at each wavelength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> OWDM networks provide the capability to transmit large amounts of data between locations, but they have a fundamental limitation. OWDM networks require the use of optical fiber to move data from one point to another. Hence, OWDM networks may not serve areas where installation and maintenance of optical fiber is difficult and expensive. These areas may comprise rural areas where there are few users and these users are separated by significant distances, making the provision of fiber uneconomical. These areas may also include densely populated urban areas where the costs of interfering with the infrastructure and providing OWDM fiber to multiple locations may be prohibitively expensive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> OWDM networks may still be deployed in these areas, but they will generally be deployed in a relatively small area, servicing users who are closely located. Links to users on other networks may be accomplished by tying the networks together through the use of OWDM fiber or through the use of lower performing non-WDM data links. Coupling the separate OWDM networks through the use of OWDM fiber has the difficulty and expense factors discussed above. Non-WDM data links (such as radio frequency links or telephone lines) can be provided at a lower cost, but the networking capabilities inherent in a WDM network are lost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A system for linking separate OWDM networks is described and claimed in the copending patent application entitled &ldquo;Wireless Wavelength Division Multiplexed System,&rdquo; Ser. No. ______, filed on ______(Attorney Docket No. 617883). The present patent application discloses the conversion of data transported on each optical wavelength in an OWDM system to a corresponding microwave or millimeter-wave frequency in a one-to-one correspondence. One technique which may be used for converting the several modulated optical carriers in an OWDM network to modulated radio frequency carriers transporting the same information as in the OWDM network, is to first de-multiplex the OWDM optical carriers and then detect the information in each channel using separate photodetectors. The photodetectors essentially convert the optical signals to electrical signals. The data in the individual electrical signals then modulates separately generated radio frequency carriers for wireless transmission with a one-to-one correspondence to the optical channels in the OWDM network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, the generation of low phase noise signals at microwave or millimeter wave frequencies using standard electrical frequency synthesizers may be a costly process, since several multiplication stages of a high quality, low frequency signal to the microwave or millimeter wave frequencies are required. Also, frequency synthesizers capable of this task can be quite bulky. Therefore, as the number of channels in the OWDM system, and hence in the converted wireless link, increases, the use of standard electrical frequency synthesizers to provide the required conversion can become detrimental in terms of cost and size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Therefore, there exists a need in the art for apparatus and methods that provide for the conversion of the optical channels in OWDM system to radio frequency channels in a less costly and bulky fashion. </paragraph>

Preferably, the frequency-shifted extracted optical carrier signals, f<highlight><subscript>&lgr;1</subscript></highlight>&plus;&Dgr;f<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, f<highlight><subscript>&lgr;2</subscript></highlight>&plus;&Dgr;f<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, f<highlight><subscript>&lgr;3</subscript></highlight>&plus;&Dgr;f<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, f<highlight><subscript>&lgr;4</subscript></highlight>&plus;&Dgr;f<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, are then combined by a second optical combiner <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight>, to form a composite frequency-shifted extracted optical carrier signal <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the frequency-shifted extracted optical carrier signals, f<highlight><subscript>&lgr;1</subscript></highlight>&plus;&Dgr;f<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, f<highlight><subscript>&lgr;2</subscript></highlight>&plus;&Dgr;f<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, f<highlight><subscript>&lgr;3</subscript></highlight>&plus;&Dgr;f<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, f<highlight><subscript>&lgr;4</subscript></highlight>&plus;&Dgr;f<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, may be left as separate signals and sent to the optical-heterodyne detector <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The optical-heterodyne detector <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> receives the composite optical signal <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, the composite extracted optical carrier signal <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and the composite frequency-shifted extracted optical carrier signal <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. As discussed above, the optical-heterodyne detector in alternative embodiments of the present invention may receive the extracted optical carrier signals and the frequency-shifted extracted optical carrier signals as separate signals. The optical heterodyne detector <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> performs optical heterodyning of the frequency-shifted extracted optical carrier signals with the original OWDM broadband signals to form a composite modulated wireless signal <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. The composite modulated wireless signal <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> contains multiple wireless channels, where each wireless channel has a wireless carrier signal modulated with the data carried in a corresponding OWDM channel in a one-to-one correspondence between the multiple optical channels and the wireless channels. The spectrum of the composite modulated wireless signal <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> with four channels at wireless frequencies is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Since the phase coherence of the optical carriers throughout this optical process is preserved, the resulting wireless carriers will have the low phase noise required for the wireless transmission of the broadband information originally carried in the OWDM channels. The composite modulated wireless signal <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> can then be radiated with a radiating device <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>, such as an antenna. Also, optically heterodyning the composite extracted optical carrier signal <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> with the composite frequency-shifted extracted optical carrier signal <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> in the optical heterodyne detector <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> results in the generation of a unmodulated composite wireless carrier signal <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. The unmodulated wireless carrier signals in the unmodulated composite wireless carrier signal <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> may then be used in other aspects of a wireless network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows an example of the optical to wireless conversion provided by embodiments of the present invention with four optical WDM channels f<highlight><subscript>&lgr;1</subscript></highlight>, f<highlight><subscript>&lgr;2</subscript></highlight>, f<highlight><subscript>&lgr;3 </subscript></highlight>and f<highlight><subscript>&lgr;4</subscript></highlight>, each carrying a different service (broadband data, video, multimedia) with bandwidths of D<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>(f), D<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>(f), D<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>(f) and D<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>(f). After optical carrier extraction and frequency shifting by amounts &Dgr;f<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, &Dgr;f<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, &Dgr;f<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>and &Dgr;f<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, respectively, these lightwave carriers are heterodyned with the original WDM signals resulting in wireless carriers at &Dgr;f<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, &Dgr;f<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, &Dgr;f<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>and &Dgr;f<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>modulated with the broadband data with bandwidths D<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>(f), D<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>(f), D<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>(f) and D<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>(f), respectively. Note that although mixing between each one of the optical WDM channels and the optical carriers extracted and shifted from other WDM channels does occur in the heterodyne detector <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> (for example, mixing between f<highlight><subscript>&lgr;1</subscript></highlight>&plus;D<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>(f) signal and f<highlight><subscript>&lgr;2</subscript></highlight>&plus;&Dgr;f<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>carrier), the resulting signal is well over 100 GHz and hence outside the electrical bandwidth of the heterodyne detector <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. This is because the optical WDM channels are typically separated by at least 100 GHz. Furthermnore, by optical heterodyning the extracted optical carrier signals, f<highlight><subscript>&lgr;1</subscript></highlight>, f<highlight><subscript>&lgr;2</subscript></highlight>, f<highlight><subscript>&lgr;3 </subscript></highlight>and f<highlight><subscript>&lgr;4</subscript></highlight>, and the frequency-shifted extracted optical carrier signals, f<highlight><subscript>&lgr;1</subscript></highlight>&plus;&Dgr;f<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, f<highlight><subscript>&lgr;2</subscript></highlight>&plus;&Dgr;f<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, f<highlight><subscript>&lgr;3</subscript></highlight>&plus;&Dgr;f<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, f<highlight><subscript>&lgr;4</subscript></highlight>&plus;&Dgr;f<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, in the heterodyne detector <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, only the wireless carrier signals, &Dgr;f<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, &Dgr;f<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, &Dgr;f<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>and &Dgr;f<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, without any data modulation may be obtained. Thus, embodiments of the present invention allow the generation of unmodulated wireless carriers alone as well as the wireless carriers modulated by the original broadband data in the WVDM channels. In all the above optical processes, the phase coherence of the original optical carriers in the WDM channels are maintained, which results in low phase noise microwave or millimeter wave carrier signal generation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> There are several methods available to accomplish the optical carrier extraction function in the channelizer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, including narrowband tunable filters, as well as nonlinear optical techniques, such as stimulated scattering adaptive filters. A preferred embodiment of the channelizer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> uses microresonators <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, comprising narrowband passive filters. In this case, the microresonators comprise a set of high-Q filters arranged in parallel so that the modulated and wavelength de-multiplexed optical beams pass through the filter network. Examples of high-Q filters include microspheres as well as ring resonators and microdisks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The use of microspheres as the microresonators <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> in the channelizer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is preferred. The scale size of the microspheres is in the range of 100 microns, resulting in a very compact channelizer module, which can be scaled to accommodate larger numbers of channels. The ensemble of elements can be viewed as a network of narrowband, passive optical cavities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The use of microspheres in add/drop devices for WDM systems is known in the art. For example, see Cai et al., &ldquo;5-Gbit/s BER Performance on an All Fiber-Optic Add/Drop Device Based on a Taper-Resonator-Taper Structure,&rdquo; IEEE Photonics Technology Letters, Vol. 12, No. 9, September 2000. However, in add/drop devices, the bandwidth of the microsphere must be sufficiently broad to accommodate the modulated optical signal information within the optical channel operated on by the add/drop device. For example, the bandwidth of the microsphere may be required to be on the order of several GHz to enable the selected channel with modulated information to be added to or dropped from the optical network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Microsphere-based channelizers in embodiments of the present invention should realize an exact opposite condition from the prior art microsphere-based add/drop devices discussed above. That is, each channel of a microsphere-based channeleizer must emulate an effective add/drop filter with a bandwidth narrow enough so as to extract only the optical carrier, free of any data-bearing information. This allows the data carried within each optical channel to be stripped from the optical channel. Thus, in embodiments of the present invention, the filter passband should be limited to no more than 1 to 10 MHz, instead of the prior art, whose desired bandpass is in the range of 10 GHz or more. Therefore, it is preferred that the Q of each microsphere be as high as possible, at least from 10 million to a billion, or higher. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The Qs of microspheres have been measured to be as high as one billion. This implies that an incident broadband optical beam will emerge as a narrowband beam with a bandwidth of about 100 kHz. The Q of these extremely high-Q devices tends to degrade with time, with the Q degrading to about one million in the steady state. These lowered Qs may cause undesirable information-bearing data to be passed by the channelizer. Therefore, it is preferred that the environment of the microspheres be maintained so as to maintain the microspheres in a high Q state. For example, the microspheres may be encased in a vacuum or in an inert atmosphere, such as nitrogen or a noble gas (helium, neon, etc.). Within the enclosure, &ldquo;getter&rdquo; material, such as barium, may be used to absorb residual oxygen, or other chemicals that cause the Q of the microsphere to degrade. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> It is anticipated that with proper engineering and packaging, the Q of high-Q microspheres can be stabilized in the 10 to 100 million range, resulting in a bandpass of 10 MHz to 1 MHz, respectively. Given that the expected input modulation bandwidth of the broadband data to be above the 100 MHz range, and that off-the-shelf diode laser sources may have linewidths in the 1-10 MHz range, this degree of filtering should be adequate in terms of extracting the optical carrier with minimal residual noise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment of the optical channelizer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, the micro-resonators <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> are arranged in a parallel format following the WDM demultiplexer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows a parallel arrangement of the microresonators <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, each microresonator <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> comprises a microsphere <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>. An input optical fiber <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> couples a modulated optical signal, f<highlight><subscript>&lgr;1</subscript></highlight>&plus;d<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, f<highlight><subscript>&lgr;2</subscript></highlight>&plus;d<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, f<highlight><subscript>&lgr;3</subscript></highlight>&plus;d<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, f<highlight><subscript>&lgr;4</subscript></highlight>&plus;d<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, with a given optical carrier frequency to the microsphere <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>. An output fiber <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> couples an extracted optical carrier signal, f<highlight><subscript>&lgr;1</subscript></highlight>, f<highlight><subscript>&lgr;2</subscript></highlight>, f<highlight><subscript>&lgr;3</subscript></highlight>, f<highlight><subscript>&lgr;4</subscript></highlight>, from the microsphere <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the input fiber <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> and output fiber <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> are tapered in the vicinity of the microsphere <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> to provide optimum optical coupling and phase matching between the fundamental modes in the microsphere <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> and the fibers <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> An alternative embodiment of a channelizer eliminates the use of a WDM demultiplexer before the channelizer to split the composite optical signal into separate optical outputs for each optical channel. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a channelizer <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> that provides separate optical carrier signals, f<highlight><subscript>&lgr;1</subscript></highlight>, f<highlight><subscript>&lgr;2</subscript></highlight>, f<highlight><subscript>&lgr;3</subscript></highlight>, f<highlight><subscript>&lgr;4</subscript></highlight>, directly from the composite optical signal <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. The channelizer <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> comprises a common optical fiber bus <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> and add/drop microspheres <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> in a serial arrangement. Each microsphere <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> is individually tuned to be resonant with a given optical carrier frequency. As the fiber bus <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> physically approaches each microsphere <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>, the fiber is preferably locally tapered. The tapered region is employed to enable optimum coupling of the light into each individual microsphere <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>. Light that is resonant with the microsphere (i.e., an optical carrier signal) will be coupled into the microsphere, with the coupled light then emerging into the output fiber <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>, which is also preferably tapered and located adjacent the microsphere <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>. Since the bandpass of the microsphere <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> is so narrow, only the optical carrier signal is retrieved and not the broadband data modulated onto the carrier. Each microsphere <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> captures and outputs an optical carrier signal, f<highlight><subscript>&lgr;1</subscript></highlight>, f<highlight><subscript>&lgr;2</subscript></highlight>, f<highlight><subscript>&lgr;3</subscript></highlight>, f<highlight><subscript>&lgr;4</subscript></highlight>, corresponding to the resonant frequency of the microsphere <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>. Essentially, the channelizer <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> acts as a &ldquo;drop&rdquo; device, where a given optical carrier is &ldquo;dropped&rdquo; by a given microsphere <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>, while the remaining carrier signals travel via the main fiber bus <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> to the other microspheres <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> to be &ldquo;dropped.&rdquo; Alternatively, the main fiber bus <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> may be spliced to specific fiber portions in the vicinity of the microspheres <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> to simplify the fabrication of the channelizer <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The optical resonant frequency tuning of each microsphere in a microsphere-based channelizer may be accomplished by applying a small perturbation to each individual microsphere, with each microsphere having an independent controller. Returning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, a controller <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> is coupled to each microsphere <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> to provide the perturbation of the microsphere <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> to provide resonance with a given optical carrier. The perturbation may be in the form of a temperature change (in the range of a few degrees), a pressure change, or other direct physical change that affects the resonance of the microsphere. Alternatively, a controllable amount of laser light, tuned to an absorption feature of the microsphere medium (e. g., a rare-earth-doped glass, or an absorption feature induced via a color center) may be coupled to the microsphere. The absorbed light may, as an example, modify the refractive index of the microsphere via thermally induced effects (dN/dT). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Environmental losses may be of sufficient severity as to limit the ultimate Q of a given microsphere. In such a case, a microsphere having an optically pumped active laser medium (such as rare-earth doped or Raman-active material) may be used. If the active microsphere is optically pumped below its lasing threshold (i.e., the pumped light within the microsphere does not oscillate), then the optical gain present within the microsphere will, in effect, give rise to a cavity enhanced Q for the device. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows a channelizer <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> having multiple microresonators <highlight><bold>621</bold></highlight> in which the microspheres <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> are optically pumped. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, optical pump energy from a pump laser <highlight><bold>650</bold></highlight> is coupled to each microsphere <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> by a coupling fiber <highlight><bold>651</bold></highlight>. The optical pump laser <highlight><bold>650</bold></highlight> may be a laser diode or other device suitable for providing laser pump energy. Optically pumping the microsphere <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> results in a microresonator <highlight><bold>621</bold></highlight> that functions as an ultranarrowband filter. The bandpass of the filter may be actively controlled by varying the optical pumping power (on the order of less than 100 microwatts). A servo controller may then be used to maintain the desired bandpass over the lifetime of the device. Similarly, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows a serial channelizer <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight> which has an optical pump laser <highlight><bold>650</bold></highlight> coupled to each microsphere <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> by a coupling fiber <highlight><bold>651</bold></highlight>. Typical wavelength for the input optical carriers may be in the 1500 nm range, whereby the laser pump wavelength may be in the 900 nm range. Therefore, alternative embodiments of channelizers may have the microspheres pumped with laser energy from the same optical fibers providing the input optical carriers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Alternative embodiments of channelizers according to the present invention may comprise ring resonators or disk resonators. Monolithic ring or disk resonator structures fabricated as an integrated optical chip using a planar waveguide structure are known in the art. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,009,115, &ldquo;Semiconductor Micro-Resonator Device,&rdquo; issued Dec. 28, 1999. Preferably, multiple ring or disk resonators are fabricated on a single chip. Also, the technique discussed above for improving the performance of the microsphere-based channelizer by pumping the microspheres with optical energy may also be used with ring or disk-based channelizers. That is, the ring or disk resonators comprising the microresonators in the channelizer may also be optically pumped below the lasing threshold to give rise to a cavity enhanced Q for the microresonator. The bandpass for the resulting filter can be controlled and maintained as discussed above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Given the small size of the microresonators, whether microspheres, ring resonators, or disk resonators, the channelizer used in embodiments of the present invention is expected to be very small and robust. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> An additional subsystem that may be used within embodiments of the channelizer according to the present invention is a real-time feedback controller to account for frequency drifts so that the line-center of the filter is always locked to the wavelength of the respective optical carrier it is extracting. There are several different servo-control approaches that can be used to track frequency drifts in the optical carrier. In one approach, the central frequency of the microresonator can be swept (or ramped), while measuring the transmitted optical signal. After a ramp cycle, a processor can then determine the maximum signal detected (which corresponds to the central frequency, assuming a modest modulation index) and set the filter frequency accordingly (via thermal control as an example). A related approach would be to dither the central frequency of the microresonator (via a sinusoidal thermal perturbation) and subsequently employ a phase sensitive detector (a lock-in amplifier, as an example) to then determine the required dc temperature setting. Given that the anticipated frequency drifts (thermal, mechanical, etc.) are expected to vary slowly, a rather low-bandwidth controller can suffice (100 Hz or less). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> One circuit that may be used for tuning a microresonator to track optical frequency drifts is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8, a</cross-reference> frequency-tuned microresonator <highlight><bold>821</bold></highlight> comprises the input fiber <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, the output fiber <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>, and the microsphere <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>. The frequency-tuned microresonator <highlight><bold>821</bold></highlight> additionally comprises an optical splitter <highlight><bold>822</bold></highlight>, a photodetector waveguide <highlight><bold>823</bold></highlight>, a photodetector <highlight><bold>825</bold></highlight>, a maximum signal detection circuit <highlight><bold>827</bold></highlight>, and a temperature controller <highlight><bold>829</bold></highlight>. A small portion of the optical carrier signal, f<highlight><subscript>&lgr;1</subscript></highlight>, in the output fiber <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> is split by the optical coupler <highlight><bold>822</bold></highlight> and coupled to the photodetector <highlight><bold>825</bold></highlight> by the photodetector waveguide <highlight><bold>823</bold></highlight>. The optical carrier signal, f<highlight><subscript>&lgr;1</subscript></highlight>, is detected by the photodetector <highlight><bold>825</bold></highlight> and converted to an electrical signal. The photodetector <highlight><bold>825</bold></highlight> may comprise a simple, low cost photodiode. The intensity of the electrical signal is then detected by the maximum signal detection circuit <highlight><bold>827</bold></highlight>, which measures the time derivative of the signal to determine a maximum. Maximum signal detection circuits <highlight><bold>827</bold></highlight> are well known in the art. The output of the maximum signal detection circuit <highlight><bold>827</bold></highlight> is coupled to the temperature controller <highlight><bold>829</bold></highlight>, which controls the temperature of the microsphere <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>. The servo circuit provided by the combination of the photodetector <highlight><bold>825</bold></highlight>, the maximum signal detection circuit <highlight><bold>827</bold></highlight>, and the temperature controller <highlight><bold>829</bold></highlight> functions by dithering the temperature of the microsphere and monitoring the time derivative of the photodetector signal. A zero time derivative corresponds to a maximum temperature dependent transmission of the microsphere <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>, and hence the optimum tuning of the resonator <highlight><bold>821</bold></highlight> with respect to the filtered optical carrier signal, f<highlight><subscript>&lgr;1</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The required temperature variation for the microsphere <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> should be on the order of a few degrees, with the necessary stability on the order of a few tenths of a degree, all well within the state of the art for controllers and compact thermoelectric (TE) devices. Given the relatively small thermal mass of the microspheres, the overall size and power consumption of the temperature controller is expected to be small. Therefore, a microsphere-based channelizer with frequency tuning is also expected to consume little power and to be relatively small. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> An alternative channelizer embodiment according to the present invention may employ a mode-locked and injection-locked laser to perform the function of extracting the optical carrier from the incident signal. A system block diagram showing this alternative channelizer embodiment is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. The alternative channelizer embodiment requires that a mode-locked laser <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight> be used as the source transmitter (the &ldquo;master&rdquo; mode-locked laser), instead of a set of free-running lasers (and, moreover, that there is negligible channel dispersion). The master mode-locked laser <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight> generates multiple optical carrier signals at different optical carrier frequencies, which have a fixed phase relationship to each other due to their generation from a master mode-locked laser. Typically, the master mode-locked laser generates the multiple optical carrier signals as a composite optical carrier signal <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. Data signals <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> are then modulated by a modulator <highlight><bold>911</bold></highlight> onto the optical carrier signals to create the composite optical signal <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The channelizer in the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> comprises a slave mode-locked and injection-locked laser <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight> which is nearly identical to the master mode-locked laser <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight>, with a controllable cavity length (in the form of a piezoelectric-driven mirror or an intracavity electro-optical phase shifter). A portion of the optical energy of the composite optical signal <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is directed to the slave mode-locked and injection-locked laser <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight> by the optical coupler <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. If the slave mode-locked and injection-locked laser <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight> is set to be below threshold, then, in the presence of the composite optical signal <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, the slave mode-locked and injection-locked laser <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight> will break into a mode-locked oscillation condition, with the output spectrum comprising the composite extracted optical carrier signal <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, the incident respective sidebands of the various optical carrier signals, corresponding to the modulating broadband data signals, will not have sufficient peak power to influence the intracavity saturable absorber and, therefore, will not produce significant output levels. Thus, in effect, the slave mode-locked and injection-locked laser <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight> will be a local source that generates the composite extracted optical carrier signal <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> with extracted optical carrier signals that are phase coherent with the optical carriers in the composite optical signal <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, the extracted optical carrier signals are frequency shifted by the optical frequency converter <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. The optical frequency converter <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> comprises a bank of optical frequency converter units <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>, where each optical frequency converter unit <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> applies a specified frequency shift to a corresponding extracted optical carrier signal, with the frequency shift being in the range of wireless frequencies. All-optical techniques available for optical wavelength conversion such as cross-phase modulation, cross-gain modulation and four-wave mixing are well known in the art. In a preferred embodiment, four-wave mixing in a semiconductor optical amplifier may be employed to obtain wavelength conversion of the extracted optical carrier. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows the block diagram of this prior art technique that consists of a pump laser <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, a WDM coupler <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, an Er-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> and a semiconductor optical amplifier <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>. The wavelength of the pump laser <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is tunable resulting in a controlled frequency downconversion of the input light, which, in this case, is an extracted optical carrier signal of the composite optical WDM signal. Wavelength shifts of 0-30 nm in the 1550 nm window of the EDFA are achievable, resulting in optical frequency shifts of 0-3.8 THz. The wireless frequencies of the wireless carriers are typically in the range of 20-50 GHz. Each of the extracted optical carriers are frequency-shifted by an amount equal to the wireless frequency of the corresponding wireless channels. The four-wave mixing process is a coherent one preserving the phase coherence of the extracted optical carriers of the original WDM signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, the optical-heterodyne detector <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> optically heterodynes the composite frequency-shifted extracted optical carrier signal <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> with the composite optical signal <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to generate the composite modulated wireless signal <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>.

A second optical coupler <highlight><bold>983</bold></highlight> is used to combine the composite extracted optical carrier signal <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> with the composite frequency-shifted extracted optical carrier signal <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>.
