<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A system and method for linking optical wavelength division multiplexed (OWDM) networks by using wireless communications. Each optical channel in a OWDM network is coupled to a wireless wavelength division multiplexing (WWDM) channel by a WWDM transceiver, which transmits and receives data between OWDM networks. The WWDM transceiver may transmit and receive data in RF bands, where the assignment of different OWDM channels to different frequencies within the RF bands may depend upon the data rate or service supported by the OWDM channel. WWDM systems may also support communications between OWDM networks and individual users, such as those in a local multipoint distribution service. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to multiple channel communication systems, and more specifically to multiple channel communication systems supported by integrated optical and wireless wavelength division multiplexed networks. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) is a basic technology of networking optical signals. It is a technique by which a single fiber is used to carry many separate and independent optical channels. Each channel within the optical wavelength division multiplexed (OWDM) network is assigned a separate optical wavelength at which it is transmitted through the network. In a &ldquo;sparse&rdquo; OWDM system, the optical wavelengths are (relatively) widely separated. For example, two optical wavelengths of 850 nm and 1310 nm may be used in a sparse system. Such a system has an advantage of being easily implemented, but a major disadvantage is the limited number of optical channels that can be carried. In a &ldquo;dense&rdquo; OWDM system, the optical wavelengths are closely spaced. In a typical dense optical wavelength division multiplexed (DOWDM) system, the channel spacing may be as small as 1 nm or less. DOWDM systems provide substantially more channels than a sparse system, but are also more complex and difficult to implement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Since OWDM networks comprise multiple communication channels, network control and routing can be achieved by directing specific channels to specific users. This concept is referred to in the art as Add-Drop Multiplexing (ADM). In ADM, an optical WDM network passes through multiple locations or nodes. At each node, one or more individual optical channels are removed (dropped) from the WDM stream and terminated in a local device. Similarly, a channel can be added into the WDM stream. Such ADM networks can be implemented using fixed wavelengths assigned to each node, or each node can be dynamically assigned wavelengths for dedicated data transmission and reception. Such dynamic ADM networks may be implemented with the wavelength allocation determined at each node or a master controller can be used to dynamically determine the wavelength allocation at each node. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> OWDM networks may also provide the ability, in a given network, to allocate different services (or area of coverage) to different optical wavelengths for direct addressing. One example is in hybrid fiber coax WDM technology, where each service (broadcast video, pay per view, etc.) or different housing communities are routed by a designated wavelength in a Passive Optical Network (PON) architecture. Allocation of different services to different wavelengths simplifies the distribution of these services via optical networks, since the distribution hardware used in the networks does not need to know the type of service carried at each wavelength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> OWDM networks provide the capability to transmit large amounts of data between locations, but they have a fundamental limitation. OWDM networks require the use of optical fiber to move data from one point to another. Hence, areas where installation and maintenance of optical fiber is difficult and expensive may not be served by OWDM networks. These areas may comprise rural areas where there are few users and these users are separated by significant distances, making the provision of fiber uneconomic. These areas may also include densely populated urban areas where the costs of interfering with the infrastructure and providing OWDM fiber to multiple locations may be prohibitively expensive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> OWDM networks may still be deployed in these areas, but they will generally be deployed in a relatively small area, servicing users who are closely located. Links to users on other networks may be accomplished by tieing the networks together through the use of OWDM fiber or through the use of lower performing non-WDM data links. Coupling the separate OWDM networks through the use of OWDM fiber has the difficulty and expense factors discussed above. Non-WDM data links (such as radio frequency links or telephone lines) can be provided at a lower cost, but the networking capabilities inherent in a WDM network are lost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Use of radio frequency links to tie together data networks is known in the art. For example, Ceragon Networks Ltd. of Tel Aviv, Israel provides products such as the FiberAir 3100 or 6200 Digital Radio System, which may be used to couple multiple Ethernet, SONET/SDH, or ATM networks. However, these systems operate at the transport level of the coupled networks, in that they recognize and process the protocol of the data transferred within the networks. This increases the overhead and complexity of the hardware used to couple the networks. In addition, these systems require network management to ensure that the coupled networks operate correctly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Hence, there exists a need in the art for wirelessly linking separate OWDM networks with low cost, low overhead, and low complexity links while allowing transparent transfer of data between the linked OWDM networks. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a system and method for linking separate fiber OWDM networks via wireless communication to allow the combined networks to be operated as a single and unified WDM network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It is a further object of the present invention to provide integrated management of the single and unified WDM network to provide wavelength routing, addressing, and switching capabilities of the separate channels in the network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The system and method of the present invention is provided by a one-to-one mapping of the wavelengths of the optical channels in an OWDM network to wireless channel frequencies. Hence, each optical channel in an OWDM network in the optical domain will be replicated with a radio frequency (RF) channel in the radio frequency domain. The RF channels can then be radiated from one location to another location by free-space, that is, wireless, radiation. At the receiving location, the RF channels are converted back to optical channels for distribution within a fiber-based OWDM system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> A method according to the present invention for coupling optical wavelength division multiplexed (OWDM) networks having one or more OWDM channels comprises the steps of: receiving the one or more OWDM channels from a first OWDM network, each OWDM channel having a different OWDM wavelength; converting each one of the one or more OWDM channels to a wireless wavelength division multiplexing (WWDM) channel to produce one or more WWDM channels at a plurality of WWDM wavelengths, each WWDM wavelength for each WWDM channel being different from the WWDM wavelength for each other WWDM channel, and each WWDM wavelength corresponding to an OWDM wavelength; radiating the one or more WWDM channels; receiving the one or more WWDM channels; converting each one of the received WWDM channels from the WWDM wavelength for that WWDM channel back to the corresponding OWDM wavelength for that WWDM channel to produce one or more received OWDM channels; and coupling the one or more received OWDM channels into a second OWDM network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In the method described above, a standardized one-to-one mapping may be used to map OWDM channels to WWDM channels and vice versa. This standardized one-to-one mapping may be based upon the data rate of the OWDM channel and the bandwidth available for the WWDM channel, which may depend upon the frequency band at which the WWDM channel operates. The method described above may also be used to link OWDM channels to different and geographically dispersed radio frequency users. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The method for coupling optical networks may further comprise the step of distributing voice and data services (hereinafter voice/data services) to other wireless users. One or more OWDM channels may be allocated for voice/data services and these voice/data OWDM channels may be converted to WWDM channels in the manner described above. If the WWDM channels are radiated at frequencies compatible with local wireless user equipment, these WWDM channels can be received and sent by that local wireless user equipment. The local wireless equipment can then extract the voice/data services from the radiated WWDM channels and can convert the voice/data services for transmission within the WWDM channels for reception and conversion back to voice/data OWDM channels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> A wireless wavelength division multiplexing (WWDM) system according to the present invention for coupling optical wavelength division multiplexed (OWDM) networks may comprise: one or more WWDM transmitters receiving one or more optical wavelength division multiplexed (OWDM) channels, each OWDM channel having a different OWDM wavelength, said WWDM transmitter converting the one or more OWDM channels to one or more WWDM channels, each WWDM channel having a different WWDM wavelength; one or more radiating apertures coupled to each WWDM transmitter, said radiating apertures radiating the WWDM channels; one or more receiving apertures receiving WWDM channels; one or more WWDM receivers coupled to the one or more receiving apertures, each WWDM receiver receiving one or more received WWDM channels, and each WWDM receiver converting the one or more received WWDM channels to one or more OWDM channels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The WWDM transmitter in the WWDM system described above may comprise: an OWDM demultiplexer; an optical-to-electrical converter coupled to the OWDM demultiplexer and producing one or more baseband electrical signals; a comb frequency generator producing a plurality of intermediate frequency signals; a bank of modulators, each modulator in the bank of modulators receiving a baseband electrical signal from the optical-to-electrical converter and receiving an intermediate frequency signal from the comb frequency generator and producing a modulated baseband electrical signal; and one or more upconverters receiving the modulated baseband signals and producing the one or more WWDM channels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The WWDM receiver in the WWDM system described above may comprise: one or more downconverters receiving the one or more received WWDM channels and producing one or more received baseband signals; a comb frequency generator producing a plurality of intermediate frequency signals; a bank of demodulators, each demodulator in the bank of modulators receiving one of the one or more received baseband signals from the one or more downconverters and receiving an intermediate frequency signal from the comb frequency generator and producing a demodulated baseband electrical signal; an electrical-to-optical converter receiving each one of the demodulated baseband electrical signals and producing an optical signal for each demodulated baseband electrical signal at an OWDM wavelength corresponding to the WWDM wavelength for the WWDM channel from which the optical signal is derived; and an OWDM multiplexer receiving each optical signal and producing the one or more OWDM channels. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The system of wireless wavelength division multiplexed networking according to the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying figures. A high-level view of an embodiment of the system according to the present invention is provided in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the optical channels of a first optical network <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> using optical wavelength division multiplexing are shown as a first set of individual optical signals <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> at wavelengths &lgr;(O<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>) . . . &lgr;(O<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>) (hereinafter &lgr;<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>. . . &lgr;<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>). Preferably, the first optical network <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> comprises a wavelength division multiplexed fiber network. These individual optical signals <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> at the optical wavelengths &lgr;<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>. . . &lgr;<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>are converted to radio frequency (RF) signals <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> at wireless frequencies f(W<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>) . . . f(W<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>) (hereinafter f<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>. . . f<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>) by an optical wavelength to wireless frequency converter <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The RF signals <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> are then transmitted from a first RF aperture <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and received by a second RF aperture <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>. The received RF signals <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> at the wireless frequencies f<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>. . . f<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>are then converted back to a second set of optical signals <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> at, preferably, the same optical wavelengths &lgr;<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>. . . &lgr;<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>by a wireless frequency to optical wavelength converter <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and sent to a second optically-based network <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. Preferably, there is a standard, one-to-one mapping of optical WDM wavelengths to wireless frequencies. The RF signals are simply wireless frequency analogs to the OWDM wavelengths, and, therefore, the overall scheme may be referred to as wireless wavelength division multiplexing (WWDM). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a more detailed block diagram of the elements that may be used to implement a WWDM system according to the present invention. An optical demultiplexor <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> separates a multiple wavelength optical signal from the OWDM network <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> into a first set of several optical signals <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> at their separate optical wavelengths &lgr;<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>. . . &lgr;<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>. The several optical signals <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> are coupled to a WWDM transmitter <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. The WWDM transmitter <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> comprises an optical-to electrical converter <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, a transmit comb frequency generator <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, a modem bank <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, and an upconverter <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. An optical-to-electrical converter <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> converts the several optical signals <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> modulated at the optical wavelengths to baseband electrical signals. The embodiment of the WWDM transmitter <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows the transmitter <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> receiving optical signals, while alternative embodiments of the transmitter may omit the internal optical-to-electrical converter <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, such that electrical signals are coupled to the transmitter <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. The baseband electrical signals are then coupled to the modem bank <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. The modem bank <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> comprises a plurality of baseband modulators. The transmit comb frequency generator <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> generates a plurality of intermediate frequency carrier signals at equally spaced frequencies f<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>. . . f<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>. These frequencies are provided to the modem bank <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> that modulates each baseband electrical signal obtained from the data signals in the OWDM network <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The modulated signals are then coupled to the upconverter <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> for up conversion to radio frequencies within a specified RF band. RF bands at frequencies used for cellular telephony, personal communication systems, microwave or millimeter wave communications may be used. Preferably, the transmit comb frequency generator <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is preset to create a grid of frequencies that map directly to the optical wavelengths used in the OWDM network <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> in a one-to-one correspondence. A standard set of frequencies may be used to provide for interoperability between WWDM systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The radiating aperture <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> radiates the RF signals towards the receiving aperture <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> connected to a WWDM receiver <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. The radiating aperture <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and the receiving aperture <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> may comprise RF transmit and receive antennas well known in the art. The WWDM receiver <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> comprises a downconverter <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>, a receive comb frequency generator <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, a modem bank <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> comprising a plurality of baseband demodulators, and an electrical-to-optical converter <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>. WWDM RF signals received by the receiving aperture <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> are directed into the downconverter <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> which provides downconverted signals. The downconverted signals are demodulated within the modem bank <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> with a plurality of intermediate frequency carrier signals at equally spaced frequencies f<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>. . . f<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>generated by the receive comb frequency generator <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. The frequencies generated by the transmit and receive comb frequency generators <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> should be the same to provide for proper modulation and demodulation of the baseband electrical signals. The modem bank <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> provides baseband electrical signals containing data information. These baseband electrical signals are coupled to an electrical-to-optical converter <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> to produce the second set of optical signals <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> which, preferably, have the same optical wavelengths as the first set of optical signals <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. A multiplexer <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> then combines the second set of optical signals into a single composite optical signal which is transferred to the second OWDM network <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> An alternative method and apparatus for converting OWDM channels to WWDM channels is described in the copending patent application &ldquo;Optical-to-Wireless WDM Converter,&rdquo; Ser. No. ______, filed on ______ (Attorney Docket No. 618697), incorporated herein by reference. The optical-to-wireless converter described in that application provides for conversion of OWDM channels to WWDM channels by extracting optical carriers from the OWDM channels, frequency shifting the optical carriers by the frequencies of the wireless carriers, and optically heterodyning the frequency-shifted optical carriers with the OWDM channels to generate WWDM channels. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, each optical network <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is coupled to a WWDM transceiver <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. Each WWDM transceiver <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is coupled to an optical demultiplexer <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> which provides individual optical signals <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, as described above. Each WWDM transceiver <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is also coupled to an optical multiplexer <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> which couples the modulated optical signals <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> into the optical network <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. Alternative embodiments of WWDM transceivers may be coupled to networks via electrical signals such that optical-to-electrical and electrical-to-optical converters are provided external to WWDM transceivers to couple the transceivers to optical networks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The WWDM transceiver <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> may simply be a combination of the WWDM transmitter <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and the WWDM receiver <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> described above. If so, each transceiver <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> comprises an upconverter <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, downconverter <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>, modem bank for modulation <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, modem bank for demodulation <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>, one or more comb frequency generators <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, an optical-to-electrical converter <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and an electrical-to-optical converter <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the comb frequency generator <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> generates a single set of intermediate frequencies for both transmitted and received signals. This provides for a direct one-to-one correspondence between optical wavelengths in the OWDM networks and the WWDM frequencies. However, the comb frequency generator <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> may generate two sets of frequencies, f<highlight><subscript>t1 </subscript></highlight>. . . f<highlight><subscript>tn </subscript></highlight>for transmission and f<highlight><subscript>r1 </subscript></highlight>. . . f<highlight><subscript>rn </subscript></highlight>for reception, to reduce signal interference between transmitted and received signals. Alternatively, the upconverter <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> and downconverter <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> in each WWDM transceiver <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> may be configured to send and receive signals at different RF bands to reduce signal interference. Other signal interference reducing techniques known in the art may also be used, such as time division multiplexing or spread spectrum techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> As is well known in the art, the data transfer capability of each radiated RF signal is dependent upon the bandwidth of the RF signal and the modulation technique used for the RF signal. The number of individual RF signals or channels and the bandwidth of each channel is dependent upon the RF band in which the RF channels are transmitted. Lower frequency bands, such as the 2 GHz band used for cellular and Personal Communication Services (PCs) transmissions, can accommodate only relatively few, narrow bandwidth channels. Higher frequency bands, such as the 28 and 38 GHz bands allocated for Local Multipoint Distribution System (LMDS) transmissions, can accommodate more narrowband RF channels and/or wider bandwidth RF channels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates a possible allocation of WWDM channels at different frequency bands. At the PCS and Cellular band of 2 GHz, between 20 to 50 WDM RF channels can be accommodated, each with a maximum RF bandwidth of 1.5 MHz and a data bandwidth of up to 6 megabits per second (Mbps). At a higher frequency band, such as the 28 GHz band allocated for LMDS services, a first portion of the 28 GHz band may be allocated for several narrowband channels with a data bandwidth of up to 6 Mbps. Other portions of the 28 GHz band may be allocated for wider band signals requiring 25 MHz or 51 MHz of bandwidth. A 25 MHz channel can accommodate a data bandwidth of 60-80 Mbps, while a 51 MHz channel can accommodate a data bandwidth of up to 155 Mbps, which is the data bandwidth for SONET data rates. At an even higher frequency band, such as the 38 GHz LMDS band, more total bandwidth may be available for WWDM channels. A portion of the 38 GHz LMDS band may again be allocated for several narrowband channels, while the remainder of the band may be allocated for wider bandwidth channels, such as those used for SONET transmissions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Preferably, a universal standard frequency grid is used for interoperability between different optical networks coupled via WWDM systems. A standard grid allows a data signal modulated at a first optical wavelength in a first OWDM network to be radiated from that network with a first WWDM system and received at a second WWDM system and then remodulated and coupled into the second OWDM network at a wavelength corresponding to the first original optical wavelength. Data is transferred between the first and second OWDM networks such that the conversion from optical to RF and back to optical is transparent to both networks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> It is also preferable that universal standard frequency channel allocations be used for each RF frequency band in which the WWDM systems are to operate. That is, relatively low data bandwidth optical channels may be allocated for transmission at cellular or PCs frequency bands, where the available RF bandwidth is relatively narrow, while larger data bandwidth optical channels may be allocated for transmission in the 28 or 38 GHz LMDS bands, where the available RF bandwidth is larger. As indicated above, the channel allocations may be such that the narrow band channels are allocated at both the lower frequency bands and at higher frequency bands, since the narrow band channels require relatively little bandwidth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Standard channel allocations are preferable to ensure that data transmission between OWDM networks via WWDM systems is transparent to the OWDM networks and does not require any type of overall WWDM system controller. The channel allocation may be accomplished by using a two-dimensional matrix table &lgr;<highlight><subscript>ij</subscript></highlight>, where i represents a frequency band (such as Cellular, PCs, LMDS, etc.) and j represents a channel number in that band, and &lgr;<highlight><subscript>ij </subscript></highlight>represents the frequency allocated for that band and channel. The channel allocations in the WWDM matrix table may then be mapped to standard OWDM channels so that WWDM channels providing sufficient bandwidth are mapped to the correct OWDM channels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The comb frequency generator as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 2</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is a well-known device that may be used to generate a plurality of continuous wave (CW) signals at different frequencies with specific frequency offsets between the signals at different frequencies. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> shows one method which may be used to generate the necessary signals at different frequencies. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A, a</cross-reference> sinusoidal source <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> produces a CW signal at frequency f<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>. The sinusoidal source <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> is coupled to a harmonic generator means <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>, such as a step recovery diode, varacter diode, or other harmonic generator means known in the art. The harmonic generator means <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> produces a signal at the frequency f<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>of the sinusoidal source <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> and signals at harmonics of that frequency f<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>. Electrical bandpass filters <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> set at different pass frequencies produce a plurality of CW signals at different frequencies f<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>. . . f<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference> illustrates a method for generating a comb of optical CW signals. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B, a</cross-reference> plurality of optical signals <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> at different optical wavelengths &lgr;<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>. . . &lgr;<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>in a single fiber <highlight><bold>555</bold></highlight>, such as the signals within an OWDM network, are coupled into an optical coupler <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight> together with a CW optical signal produced by a local optical oscillator <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight>. This coupling creates a comb of optical beat frequencies equal to the difference in frequency of the local oscillator signal and the frequencies of each signal in the plurality of optical signals <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>. An optical-to-electrical converter <highlight><bold>580</bold></highlight> and bandpass filters <highlight><bold>585</bold></highlight> may then be used to extract individual frequencies used for modulating WWDM signals in the radio frequency domain or the comb of optical frequencies may be used to directly modulate optical signals. Additional techniques for generating frequency combs are described by R. Logan in &ldquo;All-Optical Heterodyne RF Signal Generation Using a Mode-Locked-Laser Frequency Comb,&rdquo; International Microwave Symposium Digest, Paper &num;TH4C-2, Jun. 15, 2000, Ken-ichi Kitayama in &ldquo;Highly Stabilized MM-Wave Generation By Using Fiber-Optic Frequency Tunable Comb Generator,&rdquo; Journal of Lightwave Technology, vol. 15, no. 5, May 1997, pp. 883-893, and P. Coppin et al. in &ldquo;Novel Frequency Comb Synthesis Using Optical Feedback,&rdquo; Electronics Letters, Jan. 4, 1990, vol. 26, no. 1, pp.27-30. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The WWDM systems according to the present invention are preferably used for transmission of digital data. Since data in OWDM networks is generally in a digital form, the conversion of optical signal to baseband electrical signals, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 2</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, usually results in a digital data stream for each optical signal. The modems shown in the modem banks in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 2</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> normally process the digital signals into In-Phase (I) and Quadrature (Q) bit streams. To preserve signal bandwidth, each modem then converts multiple bits of each I/Q bit stream into symbols for representation as a Phase Shift Keying (PSK) or Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) signal. Modulation of the PSK or QAM signal with a carrier signal from the comb frequency generator provides for an analog signal at an intermediate frequency or radio frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Modems in the modem banks may be provided by commercial of-the-shelf (COTS) components. Examples of COTS modems applicable to WWDM systems are wireless broadband modem products available from SiCom Incorporated of Scottsdale, Ariz. SiCom provides integrated circuits, such as the SM 7060 Programmable Digital Modulator ASIC, and circuit cards, such as the MC2470 Modulator Circuit Card, that can be used to provide a PSK or QAM signal at a specified IF output frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> WWDM systems according to the present invention are not limited to the coupling of only two individual OWDM networks. Other network architectures and topologies are provided by other embodiments of WWDM system according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates a mixed service WWDM system where signals on some of the WWDM RF channels are directed, via a re-configurable antenna <highlight><bold>621</bold></highlight>, to selected users <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight>, such as in a local multipoint distribution system (LMDS) <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>. The RF channels allocated for LMDS users <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> may be operated as a combination of broadcast and interactive communication channels. A network operations center (NOC) <highlight><bold>650</bold></highlight> coupled to the OWDM network <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may provide for network operation, management, and control for each channel. Specifically, the NOC may control the routing of certain WWDM channels to specific LMDS users <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight>, and may also control the re-configurable antenna <highlight><bold>621</bold></highlight> to direct specific RF channels to specific users or areas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment of a WWDM system according to the present invention provides add/drop multiplexing at the WWDM transceiver. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference> shows a block diagram in which optical add-drop multiplexers (OADMs) <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> may intercept the first or second set of individual optical signals <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> between the optical demultiplexer <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and the optical to electrical converter <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> or the electrical-to-optical converter <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> and the optical multiplexer <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>. The OADMs <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> may be used to route data to a LAN <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight> by dropping an optical channel from transmission by the WWDM transceiver and instead routing that channel to the LAN <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight> or by dropping an optical channel from insertion into the OWDM network <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and again routing that channel to the LAN <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight>. Similarly, data from the LAN <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight> can be added by the OADMs <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> for either transmission by the WWDM transceiver <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> or coupling to the OWDM network <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Hence, add/drop multiplexing can be used in a WWDM system in much the same fashion as add/drop multiplexing is used in all optical networks. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference> shows a block diagram where an electrical add/drop multiplexer (EADM) <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight> is used to route data to and from a LAN <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> depicts an OWDM ring architecture where WWDM transceivers <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> are used to close the ring. Data is coupled into and out of the optical portions of the ring at access nodes (AN) <highlight><bold>850</bold></highlight>. Optical access nodes, such as OADMs, optical switches, etc., are well known in the art. The ring in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is depicted as having two link lines. Typically, in a ring architecture, data is passed from one AN <highlight><bold>850</bold></highlight> to another in one direction in one link line, and in the opposite direction in the other link line. Other ring architectures may have multiple pairs of link lines to provide for higher system reliability, where each pair of link lines has data running in the lines in opposite directions. Data transfer in a ring topology is generally faster and more reliable than in other network topologies, such as a ladder topology. However, a ring topology requires a means for closing the ring, that is, providing connectivity completely around the ring. In certain areas, there may be no fiber to provide a connection between two geographically separated ANs. In this case, a WWDM network provides the capability for &ldquo;closing the ring.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, two WWDM transceivers <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> provide for a network connection between the two ends of the OWDM ring. As described above, standard wireless frequency allocations may be used to provide for a one-to-one mapping between the OWDM wavelengths and the wireless frequencies. Since the frequency conversions are performed entirely within the WWDM transceivers <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, the conversion from optical to wireless and back is completely transparent to the data being transferred around the ring. Hence, no network management or control continuity is required to manage the transmission of data between the WWDM transceivers <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. The ring is, therefore, closed by the WWDM transceivers <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> in the same manner as if the ring closure was performed by two ANs linked by fiber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> also depicts the additional capability of the WWDM transceivers <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> to support distribution of data services to other users, while supporting OWDM ring data transfers. As also shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the WWDM transceivers <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> may support the transmission of data to and from other wireless users <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight>, such as those supported by an LMDS. The WWDM transceivers <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> allow the exchange of data between the wireless users <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> and the OWDM ring network, and, potentially, the exchange of data between the wireless users <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> and a backbone WDM fiber network <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The coupling of WWDM transceivers to an OWDM ring architecture demonstrates the flexibility and capability of the WWDM systems according to the present invention. As one skilled in the art can appreciate from the architecture depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, WWDM systems may support extremely complex network architectures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment of a WWDM system according to the present invention may be used to distribute different services to different users at the same or different RF bands. As previously discussed, OWDM networks may have different services allocated to different optical wavelengths. Since WWDM allocates specific RF channels to specific optical wavelengths, WWDM systems may also be used to distribute the services allocated to different optical wavelengths. With WWDM systems, different bandwidth and channel rates may be allocated to different RF bands and can provide the flexibility of broadcast, multi-cast, or mono-cast communications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> illustrates a NOC used to transfer data to a WWDM transceiver <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> for multiple users. The WWDM transceiver <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> acts as a base station for communication with different types of users at different bands. Hence, the WWDM transceiver <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> may contain multiple upconverters <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A</subscript></highlight>. <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>, <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>C</subscript></highlight>, <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>D </subscript></highlight>and multiple downconverters <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A</subscript></highlight>, <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>C</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>D </subscript></highlight>to support the transmission and reception of WWDM signals at multiple bands. The radiating aperture <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> coupled to the upconverters <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A</subscript></highlight>. <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>, <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>C</subscript></highlight>, <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>D </subscript></highlight>and the downconverters <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>A</subscript></highlight>, <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>C </subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>D </subscript></highlight>may comprise a single wideband antenna or multiple narrowband antennas. The radiating aperture may also be highly directional, so as to provide support for users in a limited geographical area, or it may be more omnidirectional, to support users in a more dispersed geographical area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> also illustrates the type of users that may be supported by the WWDM transceiver <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight>. For example, the users may comprise PCS band users, industrial and scientific data users, broadcast video-TV users, and high speed data (&gt;20 Mbps) users. The WWDM transceiver <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> may send and receive data for PCS users in the PCS band (around 2 GHz), industrial and scientific data users in the industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) bands (around 900 MHz, 2.4 GHz, 5.3 GHz, 5.7 GHz, and 5.8 GHz), broadcast video users in the national information infrastructure (NII) bands (around 5.15-5.35 GHz and 5.75-5.85 GHz), and high speed data users at the millimeter-wave (MMW) frequencies. The WWDM transceiver would transfer the information for each band to a single optical wavelength or groups of wavelengths to be recognized by the NOC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The wireless WDM network provided by the present invention is not limited to RF signals. Another embodiment of the present invention may use free-space transmission of optical signals to link fiber-based OWDM networks, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>A, the optical channels within a first fiber OWDM network <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are directed to an optical WWDM radiator <highlight><bold>921</bold></highlight>. The optical WWDM radiator <highlight><bold>921</bold></highlight> then directs the optical channels <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight> to an optical receiver <highlight><bold>961</bold></highlight>, where the signals are then directed to a second fiber OWDM network <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. Prior to radiation from the optical WWDM radiator, the optical channels <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight> may be shifted to different optical wavelengths to facilitate the transmission of the optical signals. If the optical wavelengths are shifted upon transmission, the optical wavelengths would, preferably, be shifted back to the original wavelengths after reception by the optical receiver <highlight><bold>961</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</cross-reference> depicts an optical WWDM system that supports optical transmissions to multiple fiber networks <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>B, an optical beam steerer <highlight><bold>950</bold></highlight> coupled to a optical WWDM radiator <highlight><bold>921</bold></highlight> may be used to direct optical signals to specific optical WWDM receivers <highlight><bold>961</bold></highlight> coupled to other fiber networks <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. Beam steerers based on an optical switch such as an electro-optical lithium niobate switch may be particularly applicable for beam steering in this application, due to their capability to quickly steer optical beams in different directions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Optical transmission of WWDM signals provides the ability to link OWDM networks in situations where RF transmissions may be subject to interference, or where data rates may exceed the bandwidth available for RF transmissions. Possible applications of optical WWDM systems are inter satellite communications or terrestrial optical communications links. Once again, a standard assignment of optical channels is preferred to facilitate links between different networks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> From the foregoing description, it will be apparent that the present invention has a number of advantages, some of which have been described herein, and others of which are inherent in the embodiments of the invention described herein. Those skilled in the art can appreciate that the networking techniques and architectures described herein can be applied to terrestrial, terrestrial to stratospheric, intra stratospheric communications, satellite, and inter-satellite communications as well as optical and/or RF communication links to facilitate global network management.
