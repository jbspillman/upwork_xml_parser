<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Drink shakers are a generally used for shaking martinis and margaritas. They generally include a shaker cup and a shaker lid, and perhaps a strainer as well. In use, the shaker cup is filled with the ingredients for the particular drink. Depending upon the drink, ice is sometimes added. The shaker lid is placed on top of the shaker cup and the drink shaker is then shaken. The contents are then poured out of the shaker into a drinking glass and served. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Drinking glasses come in many shapes and sizes. The type of drink being served generally determines the shape and size of the glass. There are, for example, martini glasses, margarita glasses, wine glasses, ice tea glasses etc., each of them having a distinctive shape. These terms denote quite specific and well known shapes of glasses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Drink shakers and drinking glasses are complete in and of themselves and are, generally, used in conjunction with one another. In use the drink ingredients are poured into the drink shakers, which are then shaken to mix the ingredients of the drink together. Then, the finished drink is poured from the drink shaker into a drinking glass. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Many bars and restaurants make an effort to differentiate their services and products from those of their competitors. Currently, fruit and mini-umbrellas are used to decorate the glasses, and distinctively colored liquors are also being used. Some bars give away souvenir glasses and such. Other bars are serving their drinks in a drink shaker and giving the customer a glass to pour the drink into the glass themselves. New ways of serving and presenting drinks to please and entertain customers are always being sought as a means for distinguishing a bar or restaurant from its competition. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A new device for serving drinks is described. A drink shaker and drinking glass are all combined into one device&mdash;a convertible drink shaker and glass. The device generally includes three separate pieces, a shaker cup, a shaker lid and a strainer. The strainer can also be used as a coaster when placed under the drinking glass.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIONS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates the arrangement of two elements of the device, which include the shaker cup <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the shaker lid <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The shaker lid and the shaker cup each having an open end and a closed end. The open end of the shaker cup and the open end of the shaker lid are sized and dimensioned relative to each to permit releasable attachment of the shaker lid to the shaker cup. Further, the closed end of the shaker lid is sized and dimensioned to fit into the open end of the shaker cup. Additionally the shaker lid has a depth suitable for use as a drinking cup. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The shaker lid is removably mounted on top of the shaker cup forming a joint <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The joint is a male-female joint. The joint is tight to the degree necessary to permit a fairly secure releasable or removable press-fit, pressure fit, or threaded connection which may be broken with the application of moderate force, without the assistance of tools. The elements can be composed of plastic, metal, glass, or other suitable material, and may be formed by injection molding, machining or extrusion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows the three basic elements of the device. The three basic elements are the shaker cup <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the shaker lid <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the strainer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The joint includes a lip <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> that is located at the open end of the shaker cup <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a rim <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> that is located at the open end of the shaker lid <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The lip of the shaker cup forms the male portion and the rim forms the female portion. As the lip mates with the rim, the joint is formed. The joint forms a seal that holds the drink ingredients in the shaker as it is being shaken. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The strainer is a manually removable strainer that fits inside of the lip of the shaker cup. The device may be manufactured such that the strainer fits over the lip and the rim fits over the strainer to form the joint, or the strainer is placed on the lip after the shaker lid is removed in order to pour the drink ingredients out of the shaker cup while holding in the ice. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates the elements of the drinking glass in an exploded arrangement. The drinking glass <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is formed by the inverted shaker lid which sets down into the open end of the shaker cup and the shaker cup fits down into the strainer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> such that the strainer acts as a coaster. The glass bowl <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, which is the inverted shaker lid <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, is shaped like the bowl of a martini glass. A martini glass is generally discernable by its broad-based inverted conical glass bowl supported by a glass stem. The glass bowl <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is placed into the shaker cup <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for support. Because the shaker cup contains ice <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the contents of the glass bowl are cooled by the ice. The ice, however, is not in contact with the drink ingredients and therefore, as the ice melts, it does not dilute the drink. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In using the device, the shaker cup is filled with the drink ingredients and ice, then the strainer is placed inside of the shaker cup and the shaker lid is placed on top of the strainer to form the joint which seals the drink ingredients and ice inside the shaker. The device is served as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, with the shaker lid mounted on top of the shaker cup and the strainer placed inside the shaker cup. Once the drink has been shaken, the customer removes the shaker lid off of the shaker cup and inverts the shaker lid to form the glass bowl. The strainer is in place inside the shaker cup and the customer just pours the contents of the strainer cup into the glass bowl. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, once the drink has been shaken the customer then lifts the shaker lid off of the shaker cup and places the strainer onto the lip of the shaker cup. Then the shaker lid is inverted and held in the customer&apos;s hand. The contents of the shaker cup are then poured into the glass bowl. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The strainer is then removed from the lip of the shaker cup. Once the strainer is removed from inside the lip the glass bowl can be placed into the shaker cup, thus the glass bowl is supported by the shaker cup. Also the strainer can be placed onto the bar and used as a coaster by placing the closed end of the shaker cup down into the strainer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In drinking from the glass, the glass bowl is lifted out of the ice bath by the customer and a drink is taken and the glass bowl is returned to the shaker cup for support and the ice bath, which keeps the drink ingredients cool. Alternatively, the glass bowl and the shaker cup can be lifted up together by the customer and a drink is taken. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Thus, while the preferred embodiments of the device have been described in reference to the environment in which they were developed, they are merely illustrative of the principles of the inventions. Other embodiments and configurations may be devised without departing from the spirit of the inventions and the scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
