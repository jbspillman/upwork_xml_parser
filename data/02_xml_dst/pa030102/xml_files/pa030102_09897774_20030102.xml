<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a system and method to remotely control and monitor a parking facility revenue system and/or a gate via an open network connection, such as an Internet connection. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> There have been and there are currently numerous ways to control and monitor parking garage access gates. For example, some parking garage gates have a guard/teller booth at the gate attended by a person. The person in the guard/teller booth typically can communicate with parking garage patrons, receive money from patrons and make change for cash transactions, receive validated parking coupons, receive credit card payment, monitor patrons leaving the parking garage, watch for theft, monitor images from video cameras in or around the parking garage, notify emergency services (e.g., fire, ambulance, police) in the invent of an emergency or crime, control the gate operation, and/or assist monthly contract patrons if their access card malfunctions. However, it is sometimes impractical and/or too expensive to keep such a guard/teller booth manned all the time (24 hours a day, 7 days a week). This often presents problems for patrons attempting to exit a parking garage after the parking garage attendant has left (i.e., when the guard/teller booth is unmanned). Hence, there is a need for a way to control and/or monitor a parking garage gate when it is impractical and/or too expensive to have a person working at a guard/teller booth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A downside to having an on-site parking attendant is that it is difficult to monitor or prevent such attendants from skimming money for themselves. If the attendant were somehow removed from the handling the money directly, it could possibly eliminate the opportunities for such theft. Hence, there is a need for a way to prevent or eliminate the problem of theft by on-site attendants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Although, some of the more recent gate control systems are essentially personal computers at the parking garage facility having software loaded therein and/or controller interface cards therein for actuating electric motors. However, if the software provider comes out with a new and improved version of the software (e.g., to repair prior bugs or to add enhanced functionality and feature), the software must be loaded, and perhaps configured, at each site. This makes it somewhat undesirable for a user to purchase an upgrade and it can decrease the frequency of such updates. Hence, there is a need for a way to more conveniently provide and upgrade the software on the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> There are currently systems where numerous gates and numerous video cameras are monitored from a guard station at or near the parking garage facility. Such configurations often use a call box at the gate to communicate with parking garage patrons from the guard station, and video cameras can be used to obtain images of the gate scene. This type of configuration allows for one person to monitor multiple gates at a facility, but it still requires a person to be on site to work at the guard station. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Some companies offer contract services to remotely monitor the security of a location. In such arrangements, there is a direct connection between the monitoring agency and the parking garage site. Often video cameras, door alarms, and fire detectors are monitored from the remote site. Such arrangements require dedicated lines for each site and are often limited to a single location for the remote monitoring station. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Some systems record or log data relating to activities at the parking garage, such as time and access card number for the entrance/exit of a monthly contract patron. Such data is typically stored on a computer at the parking garage facility or at a remote monitoring station. But such information is often not readily available and accessible from other locations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Some systems offer automated payment devices. In such arrangements, devises are provided to directly communicate with the parking equipment system to calculate fees based on time, rate, and appropriate discount validations. But due to real or perceived difficulty of use, consumers do not readily accept such devices. This results in on-site assistance being necessary. A device to reduce this assistance requirement would likely increase the acceptance of these devices, and their greater acceptance would reduce the requirement for on-site personnel and cashiers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> With the aforementioned arrangements and configurations, the only way that an owner or manager of a parking garage facility can interface with the gate controller system or easily obtain recorded data regarding the parking garage facility is by making a trip to the parking garage site or to the remote monitoring location of the contractor, or by contacting (e.g., via phone, email message, or fax) a person that is monitoring and controlling the gate. Hence, there is a need for a way for a user to monitor and/or control the activity of a parking garage gate from any location where the user may be. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the drawings, wherein like reference numbers are used herein to designate like elements throughout the various views, embodiments of the present invention are illustrated and described, and other possible embodiments of the present invention are described. The figures are not necessarily drawn to scale, and in some instances the drawings have been exaggerated and/or simplified in places for illustrative purposes only. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate the many possible applications and variations of the present invention based on the following examples of possible embodiments of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;mechanically coupled&rdquo; as used herein means that the two components may be directly or indirectly mechanically coupled in a variety of ways. Hence, there can be things or mechanisms in-between acting as couplers. For example, an electric motor that drives the motion of a gate can be &ldquo;mechanically coupled&rdquo; to the gate in numerous ways, including but not limited to: by being directly coupled; by having a shaft extending between the electric motor and the gate; by a universal joint; by a transmission; by a linkage; by a sprocket and chain; by a gear head on the electric motor; by a gear box; by a belt with pulleys; by a clutch mechanism; by a spring member; by a slider; by a pivot; or by any combination thereof. Among these examples of &ldquo;mechanically coupling&rdquo; an electric motor to a gate, the thing that remains constant is that the electric motor is driving the motion of the gate via the &ldquo;mechanical coupling,&rdquo; whatever it may be. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;communicably coupled&rdquo; is used herein to generically refer to any type of communication connection between one devices and/or computer system and another device and/or computer system. When one device and/or computer system is &ldquo;communicably coupled&rdquo; to another device and/or computer system, it can be either direct or indirect. For example, two devices are &ldquo;communicably coupled&rdquo; indirectly when routers, switches, other devices, and/or other computer systems are used, encountered, or passed through along the path for the purpose of compressing, decompressing, modulating, buffering, and/or transmitting the communication. The communication path or medium for communicating analog signals and/or digital data between one device and/or computer system &ldquo;communicably coupled&rdquo; to another device and/or computer system may include, but without limitation to: a wire, a fiber-optic cable, a coaxial cable, a pair of twisted wires, a local area network, an intranet, a wide area network, an ethernet line, a plain old telephone system, a T1 trunk, a T3 trunk, an E1 trunk, an ISDN line, a private wide area network, a public wide area network, a token ring, a cellular communications service, a direct dial-up ftp line, a cable television cable network system, a public telephone network, an Internet Protocol (IP) line or network, a dedicated communication line, a satellite communication system, a microwave communication system, a laser communication system, a photonic communication system, an infrared light communication system, a digital switch network, a PBX, a public communications system, the world wide web, the Internet, or any combination thereof. For example, two devices may be &ldquo;communicably coupled&rdquo; using hard-wire-type connections, such as phone lines, POTS, T1 lines, DSL, cable television network, modem, SCSI connection, fiber optic, Ethernet, twisted pair, switches, token rings, local area network, PBX, wide area network, Internet connections, etc. Also, two devices may be &ldquo;communicably coupled&rdquo; using wireless connections adapted to carry communication such as via electromagnetic waves, satellite transmission, microwaves, laser light, wireless optics (e.g., infrared), etc. Further, the term includes logical connections between two processes on the same system and processes connected by a common computing device&apos;s memory space. Thus, the technology by which the communication is transmitted is not material to the meaning of &ldquo;communicably coupled.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;application service provider&rdquo; or &ldquo;ASP&rdquo; is used herein to generically refer to any person, entity, corporation, or organization that provides one or more software applications to at least one user, that develops at least one software application for at least one user, that maintains and updates at least one software application for at least one user, and/or that provides services related to at least one software application (e.g., customer service, data storage, data retrieval, data processing, technical support, providing and maintaining server space, providing communication connections, improving a software application, monitoring the functionality of a computer system, creating an audit trail for data received, preparing reports for at least one user, customizing a software application for a user&apos;s needs or desires, etc.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;application service provider computer system&rdquo; or &ldquo;ASP computer system&rdquo; is used herein to generically refer to a computer system of an application service provider, which is typically used by the application service provider, at least in part, to provide products and services. An application service provider computer system may be in a single location or it may distributed in pieces (e.g., scalable pieces or modules) in many locations that are interconnected with each other by a communications network or any other way of communicating among computer system components. Typically an &ldquo;application service provider computer system&rdquo; will comprise at least one server computer. An &ldquo;application service provider computer system&rdquo; may also comprise at least one database and/or communication ports adapted to send and/or receive analog and/or digital data to and/or from at least one other computer system (e.g., a user computer system). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;program&rdquo; as used herein refers to code in the form of software adapted to run on a computer machine; logic and algorithms permanently formed with hardware, permanently burned into an E-PROM, or temporarily stored in a memory device; or any combination thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> An &ldquo;open network&rdquo; is a communication network that anyone can connect to. In other words, access to an &ldquo;open network&rdquo; is not restricted and is available to the general public. The most prevalent and largest open network is the Internet and the world wide web. In contrast, a closed network is an intranet or a local area network (LAN) that requires permission to connect to or that requires a dedicated connection point. An &ldquo;open network connection&rdquo; is formed when a device or computer system is communicably coupled to an open network such that it can access other computer systems or networks communicably coupled to the open network, transmit data to and/or from another computer system or network communicably coupled to the open network, and/or communicate with another computer system or network communicably coupled to the open network. Thus for example, a connection to the Internet (e.g., via an Internet service provider), by whatever route or means, is an open network connection. Typically publicly accessible web sites or web pages are posted on an open network. There may be restricted areas of an open network that require a password to log in, but as long as such restricted areas are accessed via the publicly accessible open network, i.e., via an open network connection, it is still a sub-part of the open network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The terms &ldquo;parking garage,&rdquo; &ldquo;parking lot,&rdquo; and &ldquo;parking facility&rdquo; are used interchangeably herein, and each can refer to any type of facility or lot for parking vehicles, which may be completely enclosed, partially enclosed, completely outdoor or open, fenced, or any combination thereof. As use herein, the terms &ldquo;parking garage,&rdquo; &ldquo;parking lot,&rdquo; and &ldquo;parking facility&rdquo; include outdoor or indoor public parking lots where patrons pay to park, or where the parking is free upon presentation of a parking validation (e.g., a parking lot or garage for a store). Such public parking lots typically have some form of barrier to inhibit vehicles from exiting the lot from anywhere other than a designated exit passageway or a designated gate. The terms &ldquo;parking garage,&rdquo; &ldquo;parking lot,&rdquo; and &ldquo;parking facility&rdquo; also include multi-floor structures, as commonly located in downtown areas or where footprint space is limited. Furthermore, the terms &ldquo;parking garage,&rdquo; &ldquo;parking lot,&rdquo; and &ldquo;parking facility&rdquo; include underground parking facilities, which are often located beneath a building. Some parking facilities are private (e.g., residential parking garage), some are public (e.g., anyone can pay to park there by the hour or day), some are contract parking (e.g., a company, firm, or person pays a monthly fee to park there), and some are combinations thereof (e.g., private lot with visitor parking, residential garage with visitor parking, contract parking garage that also provides paid parking). Typically a parking garage has some type of access gate, door, or barrier to limit or regulate entrance and/or exiting from the parking garage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Other technical terms used herein will typically have the ordinary meaning as known to one having ordinary skill in the art, and/or may be defined by reference to the latest edition of Newton&apos;s Telecom Dictionary, which tends to evolve as the technology terminology evolves and which is incorporated by reference herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a system and method to remotely control and/or monitor a parking garage gate or parking lot access gate via an open network connection, such as a secure Internet connection. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a simplified schematic of a first embodiment of the present invention. In the first embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> parking garage gate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is communicably coupled to a gate controller system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> at the parking garage location <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Each gate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has a mechanism for moving the gate in response to a signal or signals from the gate controller system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Such a mechanism can vary and there are many commonly known mechanisms that can move a gate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in response to a signal from a gate controller system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, which should be known to one of ordinary skill in the art. Hence, the details of the mechanism are not discussed herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> As used herein, a gate controller system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be: a computer system, a single personal computer, a server, a rack of computers, a specialized piece or group of hardware with limited functions compared to a general use personal computer, an application service provider computer system, or any combination thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The gate controller system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in the first embodiment is a combination of hardware components specifically designed to perform the functions needed to control the movement of the gate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, to link the gate controller system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to the Internet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> (e.g., using a modem), and to establish a secure connection or session with another computer system linked to the Internet. Hence, the gate controller system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the first embodiment has limited functionality and capabilities, as opposed to a general purpose personal computer. However, a general purpose personal computer with the appropriate software and interface cards may also be used in providing the gate controller system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Also, the gate controller system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is shown as a separate component for illustrative purposes. The gate controller system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be located anywhere at the parking garage facility <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, such as a climate controlled area, near elevator electronic equipment, or a locked closet. But in alternative, the gate controller system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be located inside of or attached to the gate housing as part of the gate assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> A remote terminal <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> linked to the Internet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. As used herein, a remote terminal <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> can be: a computer system, a single personal computer, a server, a rack of computers, a specialized piece or group of hardware with limited functions compared to a general use personal computer, an application service provider computer system, or any combination thereof. The remote terminal <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the first embodiment is a computer system at a remote location <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> apart from and away from the parking garage location <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The remote terminal <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is communicably coupled to the gate controller system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> via the Internet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> using a secure connection (e.g., SSL connection using cryptography). Because the remote terminal <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is communicably coupled to the gate controller system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> via the Internet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, the remote terminal <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> may be located anywhere in the world where some type of communication connection to the Internet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is available. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> There are several advantages to having the remote terminal <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> communicably coupled to the gate controller system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> via the Internet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. First, it allows someone to monitor the activity at the gate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, provide assistance to parking garage patrons, control the gate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and provide most any other needs that an on-site parking attendant can provide, but the person monitoring and controlling the gate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be anywhere in the world. So, for example, a parking garage gate in Dallas, Tex. can be monitored and controlled by a person working out of his/her house in Chicago. Depending on the devices located at the gate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; parking lot attendant in Chicago could: speak with parking garage patrons via a communications system (e.g., microphone and speakers); look at the patron via images from a digital video camera located within viewing proximity to the gate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, where the digital images are sent to his/her remote terminal <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> from the gate controller system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> via the Internet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>; view a parking ticket with a time stamp and validation stamp scanned into the gate controller system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> at the gate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by the patron and transmitted to the remote terminal <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> via the Internet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>; and/or visually authenticate the identity of a patron using a still camera image transmitted from the gate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by the gate controller system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> via the Internet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> As long as the person monitoring and controlling the gate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> at the remote location <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has a sufficiently-sized computer system and an Internet connection with sufficient bandwidth or speed, it doesn&apos;t matter where that person is located. This can save on overhead expenses of providing a dedicated office or station for providing a parking garage attendant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Second, because the communication connection between the gate controller system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the remote terminal <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is not limited to a dedicated line going to a monitoring station, as the parking garage attendants change shifts, the location <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the remote terminal <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> can likewise change. For example, one person may monitor and control the gate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for a certain shift or for certain days who works for a service company in California. Then, another person may monitor and control the same gate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for another shift or on other days who works for the same service company at a New York location. And yet another person may monitor and control the same gate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for yet another shift or on other days who is an independent contractor working out of his beach house in Florida. Thus, the locations of the persons monitoring and controlling the gate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can vary. The present invention allows a parking garage owner to shop around the country or around the world for the best priced &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; parking attendants. Also, the present invention provides employment opportunities for persons that cannot leave their home for health reasons, as well as for persons living in rural areas where jobs may be scarce. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> A third advantage of the present invention is that an owner and/or manager of a parking garage <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can monitor the activity at the parking garage or download prior data stored by the gate controller system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> for prior activities from anywhere via the Internet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. So, for example, if the owner of a Las Vegas parking garage lives in Michigan, he/she can check up on the activity of the parking garage from his/her computer in his/her office in Michigan. This may be a very desirable feature for a parking garage owner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> A fourth advantage of the present invention is that a single &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; parking attendant may monitor numerous parking garage gates <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> at numerous locations from the same remote terminal <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. For example, a person at a remote terminal located in Alaska could monitor and control a gate in Montana parking garage, two gates at a Colorado parking garage, and four gates at a Utah parking garage at the same time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> A fifth advantage of the present invention is that a &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; parking attendant located remotely (i.e., off-site) from the parking facility eliminates the opportunities for the attendant to steal money being handled. All of the money interchange occurs on-site using a money machine. Thus, all of the actions and transactions by the money machine can be tracked and/or recorded. Also, the attendant does not get an opportunity to physically handled the money. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> A sixth advantage of the present invention is that having a person available to assist patrons at the gate, even though being remotely located, provides a level of comfort for patrons that are not familiar with, not accustomed to, and/or not comfortable with interfacing a computer and/or machine only. A system in accordance with the present invention may provide audio and video communication between a patron and the &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; attendant (i.e., &ldquo;face-to-face&rdquo; type interaction via cameras, microphones, and video monitors). As people in a given region or at a given site become more comfortable with the computer and/or machine interfaces, the attendants will likely become less needed or not needed at all. Thus, the present invention provides a good transition from gates with on-site attendants toward gates having only machine and/or computer automated interactions for transactions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a simplified schematic of a second embodiment of the present invention. In the second embodiment, there are four gates <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> connected to the gate controller system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The gate controller system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> has two components <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. A first component <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of the gate controller system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is a general purpose computer system (personal computer) having software and hardware for controlling the gates <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, for interfacing with and communicating with a second component <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the gate controller system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and for forming a secure open network connection. The second component <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the gate controller system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is a piece of dedicated hardware similar to the gate controller system of the first embodiment. The second component <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> controls the movement of a single gate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and has hardware allowing it to interface with the first component <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of the gate controller system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Thus, the gate controller system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is scaleable and can comprise multiple similar or different components for controlling the motion of one or more gates <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, as well as any other devices that need to interact with the gate controller system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a simplified schematic of a third embodiment of the present invention. In the third embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the gate controller system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is a rack of computer components and a server. As in the first embodiment, the gate controller system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is communicably coupled to a remote terminal <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> via the Internet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The gate controller system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the third embodiment is communicably coupled to a number of components for interacting with a parking garage patron at a gate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of a parking garage, for controlling access into or out of the parking garage, and for monitoring activities at the gates or in and around the parking garage. The components communicable coupled to the gate controller system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> include: three gates <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>; a magnetic strip scanner <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> for cards (e.g., for scanning credit cards, ATM (automated teller machine) debit cards, prepaid cards, access cards, validated tickets, and/or time stamp cards); a cash machine <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>; a numeric keypad <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>; a toll tag scanner <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>; a touch screen monitor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>; and two video cameras <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. These components shown in the third embodiment are just some of the possible components that may be communicably coupled to the gate controller system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. There are other components (not shown) that also may be communicably coupled to the gate controller system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> for an embodiment of the present invention, including but not limited to: a presence detector for detecting when a person or vehicle at a gate, a fingerprint scanner, an eye scanner, a license plate recognition system, a radio receiver, a microphone, a speaker, a voice recognition system, a bar code scanner, a face recognition scanner, a chip reader, a keyboard, a monitor, a television, a call button, a vehicle sensor embedded in the pavement at the gate, an infrared camera, a thermal heat sensor, a motion detector, another computer system, a database, a printer, a document scanner, a telephone, a pay phone, a fuel pump, a fuel meter, a parking meter, a scent detection device, a transmitter, or any combination thereof. Because the gate controller system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the third embodiment is a multipurpose computer system, it comprises software and hardware for interfacing with and communicating with the components communicably coupled to it. Being communicably coupled to the gate controller system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> via the Internet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, the remote terminal <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> may monitor and control the components and devices that are communicably coupled to the gate controller system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The advantage to this type of architecture is that the remote terminal <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> can receive information from or interact with any of the components coupled to the gate controller system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, but each of the devices is not required to be directly connected to the Internet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Hence, the gate controller system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> acts a mediator. Also, each device does not have to be compatible with the remote terminal <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, but rather only needs to be compatible with the gate controller system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the software on the gate controller system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is plug-and-play. That is, numerous devices can be easily connected to the gate controller system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> as desired so that a parking garage owner or manager can upgrade the systems more easily. This should provide user-friendly features and ease of adding options to the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a simplified schematic of a fourth embodiment of the present invention. The fourth embodiment is an example of an application service provider (ASP) model incorporated into the present invention. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, three gate controller systems <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> for three parking garages at three different locations <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are communicably coupled to an ASP computer system <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. At each location <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> there is a gate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> controlled by a corresponding gate controller system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. As in the third embodiment discussed above, other devices also can be communicably coupled to each of the gate controllers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to expand the capabilities of the system and enhance the functionality of the system. With the ASP model, the software required to run the gate controller systems <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is supplied by the ASP computer system <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The software may run on the ASP computer system <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and/or the gate controller systems <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to perform tasks and procedures at the gate controller systems <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Also, the ASP computer system <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> may comprise a database where information and data generated by the gate controller systems <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> or by devices communicably coupled to the gate controller systems <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> relating to, e.g., gate activity and/or parking garage usage can be stored. Furthermore, the ASP computer system <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> may comprise a database containing information used for comparison and authentication of a person&apos;s identity, such as: voice data for voice recognition comparisons, image data for visual comparison, passwords, codes, access card numbers, reference information, patron information, emergency contact information, and attendant log-in information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The application service provider computer system <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> may provide code and data adapted to generate a web site that allows users at a remote location <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to interact with the gate controller system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> via the Internet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Hence, a user could log into the web site from anywhere via the Internet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and interact with a gate controller system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to monitor or control a gate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> An advantage to the ASP model is that if the software for the gate controller systems <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> needs to be modified or upgraded to a newer version, the new or revised software may be loaded on the ASP computer system <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> one time to effect all of the gate controller systems <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> connected to the ASP computer system <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. So instead of having to physically go to each gate controller system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and load the updated software (e.g., via CD-ROMs or diskettes), it can simply be loaded onto the ASP computer system <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> for all the gate controller system locations <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Another advantage is that the ASP computer system <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> can act as the conduit to the Internet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> for all of the gate controller systems <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Yet another advantage of the ASP model is that one service provider company may manage the monitoring and control of numerous gate controller systems for numerous clients. Thus, the service provider may arrange schedules and handle the logistics of contracting with numerous companies or persons providing &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; parking attendant services at numerous remote terminals in numerous locations. Hence, the parking garage owner or manager can simply contract with the service provider and rely on the service provider to provide the &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; parking attendants to monitor and control the parking garage gates. Therefore, the fourth embodiment provides a convenient and efficient way to link up numerous remote terminals <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> with numerous gate controller systems <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> via the Internet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a simplified schematic of a fifth embodiment of the present invention. The fifth embodiment is a variation on the fourth embodiment in that the ASP computer system is the gate controller system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> for numerous gates <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> at numerous locations <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Each gate has hardware allowing it to receive and follow motion control commands from the gate controller system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Thus, each gate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has just the essential hardware and/or software needed to perform the tasks of controllably moving the gate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (e.g., speed controller for gate motors, feedback encoders and/or sensors for providing gate position information). A gate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may further comprise other devices for interacting with a patron (e.g., touch screen monitor, microphone, speaker, card reader), as described above for the third embodiment. Such devices may also be fully controlled and driven by the gate controller system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Again, the gate controller system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> preferably comprises plug-and-play software to allow numerous combinations of auxiliary devices to be added to the system for interacting with a parking garage patron, monitoring the parking garage, and/or receiving payment or authorization information from a parking garage patron. As in the fourth embodiment, the fifth embodiment provides one access point&mdash;the gate controller system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (e.g., one web site operated from the gate controller system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>)&mdash;for linking numerous remote terminals <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to numerous gates <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> via the Internet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a simplified schematic of a sixth embodiment of the present invention. In the sixth embodiment, each gate controller system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> at each location <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is communicably coupled to an ASP computer system <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> at another location <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> via the Internet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Also, each gate controller system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is communicably coupled to a remote terminal <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> at a remote location <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> via the Internet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The sixth embodiment is similar to that of the fourth embodiment above, except that the ASP computer system <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is communicably coupled via the Internet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Also, the gate controller systems <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can utilize resources at the ASP computer system <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> as needed, but need not be communicably coupled to the remote terminal <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> via the ASP computer system <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. As a variation or if needed, the gate controller systems <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be communicably coupled to the remote terminal <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> via the ASP computer system <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>), yet still communicably coupled to the ASP computer system <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> via the Internet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. In one use of the present invention, the ASP computer system <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> could be used to receive, process, authenticate, and authorize passage through a gate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in an automated manner (e.g., if the patron inserts an access card having a number matching a valid monthly contract patron account number stored in a database at the ASP computer system <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>). And a person at the remote terminal <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> may only be contacted as needed when an automated authorization attempted by the ASP computer system <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> fails or when a patron presses a call button for assistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art having the benefit of this disclosure that this invention provides a system and method of remotely controlling and/or monitoring a parking garage gate or parking lot access gate via an open network, such as the Internet.
