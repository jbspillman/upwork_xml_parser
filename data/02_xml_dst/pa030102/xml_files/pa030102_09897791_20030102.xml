<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to electrical utility meters, and more particularly, to electrical utility meters suitable for use in polyphase power configurations to detect power quality disturbances. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Most electrical utility service providers, or simply utilities, generate polyphase electrical power, and typically three phase power. Polyphase electrical power is alternating current (AC) electrical power that is supplied on a plurality of power supply lines wherein the voltage waveform on each of the power supply lines has a unique phase angle. Polyphase electrical power may be provided to customers in a plurality of wiring configurations. A wiring configuration is defined by the number of wires (e.g., three wire or four wire) and the wiring relationship between the phases (e.g., wye or delta). While only a single phase of the polyphase electrical power may typically be provided for single family residences, true polyphase electrical power is typically provided to larger facilities such as commercial and industrial facilities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The alternating current (AC) electrical power delivered to residences, commercial facilities and industrial facilities ordinarily approximates a sine wave with respect to time, and typically flows through a residence or facility as an alternating current (AC) that also approximates a sine wave with respect to time. Utilities operate most efficiently and safely when both the voltage and current are sine waves. However, certain types of loads draw current in a non-sinusoidal manner, and if these loads are large relative to the utility&apos;s source impedance, the voltage can become non-sinusoidal as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> These non-sinusoidal voltage and current waveforms may be conveniently expressed as a Fourier series (i.e., a sum of sinusoidal waveforms of varying frequency, amplitude, and phase angle). Under most circumstances, the Fourier series for a utility includes a fundamental frequency, typically 50 or 60 Hertz, plus integer multiples of the fundamental frequency. These integer multiples of the fundamental frequency are referred to as &ldquo;harmonics.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Instruments for measuring alternating current (AC) power system voltage and current harmonics are well known to those skilled in the art. With the growing popularity of non-linear electrical power loads such as adjustable speed drives, personal computers, arc furnaces and the like, it is often desirable to determine and record whether the level of voltage or current harmonics exceed some limit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Commercially available instruments such as the Basic Measuring Instruments model 3030 or 3060 can be equipped with a feature that allows a user to program thresholds for voltage and/or current harmonics, and receive an alarm if these thresholds are exceeded. While this type of feature may have benefits in some instances, it fails to provide certain significant functions. For example, such conventional instruments do not provide any guide or pattern (i.e., template) to which the harmonic content of a measured signal may be compared to determine whether equipment at a particular site is susceptible to electrical damage or interference. This type of function is particularly important for sites having loads such as motors, rotating machines and communication equipment that are prone to damage or interference in the presence of specific harmonic conditions. In particular, the use of templates having defined harmonic thresholds enables a user to select a template for their specific type of concern, and if desired, adjust the thresholds to further customize the meter to a particular site. The present invention addresses this and other issues. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides an electrical meter for monitoring electrical conditions in a polyphase electrical system. According to an embodiment, the meter generates measured harmonic data for a plurality of phases in the polyphase electrical system. A user may select at least one of a plurality of predetermined templates including one or more harmonic data thresholds. Each of the predetermined templates may correspond to a condition where a specific device is susceptible to electrical damage or interference. The measured harmonic data is compared with the one or more harmonic data thresholds included in the at least one selected predetermined template. An alarm is generated when the measured harmonic data exceeds the one or more harmonic data thresholds included in the at least one selected predetermined template. According to a preferred embodiment, the alarm is generated in dependence upon the specific template whose one or more harmonic data thresholds are exceeded. </paragraph>

Typically, depending on the kind of service, the three current phases will be separated by a phase angle of approximately 120&deg;, as will the three voltage phases. Each phase current and its corresponding phase voltage are typically separated by a relatively small angle, such as 30&deg; as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, and sometimes are separated by no angle at all. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> schematic diagram of an exemplary electrical utility meter suitable for practicing the present invention is shown. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the exemplary meter <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is a meter intended to, among other things, measure power consumption by a load, not shown, connected to an electric utility, not shown. As will be described herein, the meter <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is also intended to measure harmonic data included in voltage and current measurement signals, and detect when the measured harmonic data exceeds predetermined thresholds corresponding to conditions where a specific system or device is susceptible to electrical damage or interference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In the exemplary embodiment discussed herein, the utility provides three phase power to the load through a plurality of power lines, not shown. The load, for example, may be the electrical system of an industrial or commercial facility. The exemplary meter <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes sensor circuitry <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and detection or measurement circuitry <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The sensor circuitry <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> includes polyphase current sensors <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and polyphase voltage sensors <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The measurement circuitry <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> includes a conversion circuit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, a processor or microcontroller <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, a nonvolatile memory <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, a display <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, and a communication port <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. The conversion circuit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> comprises a first multiplexer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, a second multiplexer <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, a first analog-to-digital (&ldquo;A/D&rdquo;) converter <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, a second A/D converter <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and a digital signal processor (&ldquo;DSP&rdquo;) <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. It will be noted that a three-phase electrical utility meter is given by way of example only. Those of ordinary skill in the art may readily adapt the inventive aspects of present invention to other types of meters, such as single phase or network meters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The current sensors <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are each connected to receive signals indicative of the current flowing through one phase of a three phase the power line (i.e., phase A, phase B, and phase C). The current sensors <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the exemplary embodiment described herein preferably each include transformers, which are advantageously situated to detect current on each respective phase of the power line. The current sensors <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are further connected to the measurement circuit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> through the first multiplexer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The voltage sensors <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are each connected to the respective phase of the power line (i.e., phase A, phase B, and phase C) to obtain a voltage measurement therefrom. To this end, the voltage sensors <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may suitably comprise high resistance voltage dividers. The voltage sensors <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are further connected to the measurement circuit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> through the second multiplexer <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The conversion circuit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is a circuit operable to receive polyphase voltage and polyphase current measurement signals and generate digital signals therefrom. The digital signals include signals representing frequency domain harmonic data corresponding to the polyphase voltage and current measurement signals. The various components of the conversion circuit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> may suitably be incorporated onto a single semiconductor substrate. An example of a suitable conversion circuit is the Power Measurement Integrated Circuit found in a model S4 electrical utility meters available from Siemens Power Transmission and Distribution, Inc. of Lafayette, Ind. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The microcontroller <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is operably configured to, and executes programming instructions to, receive the digital signals from the conversion circuit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, monitor and record the harmonic data represented by the digital signals, and detect when the harmonic data exceeds predetermined thresholds corresponding to conditions where a specific system or device is susceptible to electrical damage or interference. The microcontroller <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> enables generation of a suitable alarm when one or more of the predetermined thresholds are exceeded. The microcontroller <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> may suitably be a K0 series microcontroller available from NEC. The microcontroller <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> generally includes firmware, or in other words, an integrated memory into which programming instructions are stored. Alternatively, the programming instructions may be stored in the nonvolatile memory <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In operation, the current sensors <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> detect the current of each respective phase of the power line and generate phase current measurement signals therefrom. The current sensors <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> provide the phase current measurement signals to the first multiplexer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. Each phase current measurement signal is a signal having a voltage level that is indicative of the instantaneous current level on its respective power line. For the embodiment described herein, the phase current measurement signals have a dynamic range of approximately 0.0 volts rms to 0.3 volts rms. Other scaling factors may of course be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The first multiplexer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, under the control of the microcontroller <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, then provides the instantaneous current measurement signal from one of the phase current measurement signals to the first A/D converter <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. The first multiplexer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> typically provides each phase in a rapid succession of cycles, such that each phase is provided to the first A/D converter <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> every third cycle. According to the exemplary embodiment described herein, the first multiplexer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> provides the current measurement signals at a rate of 3.3 kHz. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The first A/D converter <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> receives and samples or digitizes the rapid succession of instantaneous current measurement signals. The first A/D converter <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> then provides to the DSP <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> a stream of digital words, each representing the average magnitude of one of the three phase currents over a particular sampling period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Contemporaneously, the voltage sensors <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> detect the phase voltage for each respective phase voltage on the power lines. The voltage sensors <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> each provide a phase voltage measurement signal to the second multiplexer <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. Each phase voltage measurement signal is typically a signal having a voltage level that is indicative of the instantaneous voltage level on its respective power line. In the exemplary embodiment described herein, the voltage sensors <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are configured to provide voltage measurement signals having a dynamic range of approximately 0.0 volts rms to 0.3 volts rms. Other scaling factors may be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The second multiplexer <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> then provides, in serial fashion, the instantaneous phase voltage measurement signal for each respective phase to the second A/D converter <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The second multiplexer <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> typically provides each phase voltage measurement signal in a rapid succession of cycles, such that each phase is provided to the second A/D converter <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> every third cycle. According to the exemplary embodiment described herein, the second multiplexer <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> provides the voltage measurement signals at the same rate as that used by the first multiplexer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> to provide the current measurement signals to the first A/D converter <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. Moreover, the first multiplexer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and the second multiplexer <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> operate in a coordinated fashion to provide certain phase current measurement signals contemporaneously with their corresponding phase voltage measurement signals. For example, in a four wire wye meter configuration, the first multiplexer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> provides the phase x current measurement signal and the second multiplexer <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> provides the phase x voltage measurement signal contemporaneously, where x rotates among A, B and C. In any event, the second A/D converter <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> receives and samples or digitizes the rapid succession of instantaneous voltage measurement signals. The second A/D converter <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> thus provides to the DSP <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> a stream of digital words, each representing the magnitude of one of the three phase voltage at a particular instant. The first A/D converter <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and the second A/D converter <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> therefore provide the digital current and voltage measurement signals in a predetermined coordinated phase relationship. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The DSP <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> within the conversion circuit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> receives the digital current and voltage measurement signals from the first and second A/D converters <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The DSP <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> performs a fast Fourier transform (&ldquo;FFT&rdquo;) in a known manner to convert the digital current and voltage measurement signals from the time-domain to the frequency-domain. This conversion generates harmonic information for the digital current and voltage measurement signals. The harmonic information includes the magnitude and phase of each harmonic present in each of the voltage and current measurement signals. The microcontroller <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> receives the harmonic information for the current and voltage measurement signals from the DSP <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. Using techniques described further below, the microcontroller <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> compares the harmonic information to thresholds to determine whether any of the thresholds have been exceeded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In accordance with principles of the present invention, the applied thresholds are represented by individual templates. Each template represents a condition where a specific system or device is susceptible to electrical damage or interference. For example, it is contemplated that individual templates may be used for electrical heaters, motors (e.g., rotating machines, etc.), communication systems (e.g., data, voice, etc.), and other systems or devices. According to a preferred embodiment, an individual template includes a plurality of thresholds, each threshold corresponding to a magnitude or phase of an individual harmonic. Further details regarding templates will be provided later herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> When the microcontroller <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> determines that one or more of the thresholds of a given template has been exceeded by the harmonics observed in the harmonic information provided by the DSP <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, the microcontroller <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> enables an alarm to be generated. According to a preferred embodiment, the alarm generated corresponds to the particular template that has been exceeded. That is, one type of alarm may be generated when a threshold of one template is exceeded, whereas another type of alarm may be generated when a threshold of another template is exceeded. For example, if the template exceeded corresponds to a particular piece of equipment (e.g., a motor), the site where the equipment is located may be contacted via telephone or other communication means to inform the site regarding the condition. Depending on the circumstances (e.g., if template thresholds are exceeded by a given amount), the site may also be instructed to shutdown the equipment until further notification. In less severe situations, data regarding the template threshold violations may simply be stored in a memory such as the non-volatile memory <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and communicated to the customer at a later time. The number and/or types of alarms that may be utilized in accordance with principles of the present invention is countless, and is simply a matter of design choice. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> When one or more of the thresholds of a given template has been exceeded, the microcontroller <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> also provides data regarding this condition to both the non-volatile memory <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the display <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The display <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> then provides a visual representation of the detected condition. The nonvolatile memory <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> stores the data for purposes of retention in the event of a power interruption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The microcontroller <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> also generally controls the operation of the conversion circuit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, and particularly, the first and second multiplexers <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, respectively, the first and second A/D converters <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, respectively, and the DSP <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. To this end, the DSP <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> provides timing signals and other control signals to the various other elements of the conversion circuit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> as necessary to carry out the operations described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A through 4C</cross-reference>, diagrams graphically illustrating exemplary templates of harmonic data thresholds in accordance with principles of the present invention are shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> illustrates a first exemplary template <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> having thresholds for the magnitude level of the harmonics (i.e., 1&minus;n) of a measured current signal. The harmonic thresholds shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> may represent, for example, a condition where a given system or piece of equipment is susceptible to electrical damage. The specific harmonic threshold values may be defined and/or adjusted by a user. In particular, a user may manipulate keys or buttons of a programming device, not shown, that couples to the communication port <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> to define and/or adjust one or more threshold values. The programming device may be a portable computer or other portable programming device that is configured to operate in conjunction with the controller <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> During the process of defining and/or adjusting the threshold values, a graphical illustration of the template <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> may be visually provided to the user via the display <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, or via a display of the programming device. Once the threshold values for a given template are set, the template data may be stored in memory such as non-volatile memory <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. A user may retrieve the stored template data from memory and adjust the threshold values as desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> illustrates a second exemplary template <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> having thresholds for the magnitude level of the harmonics (i.e., 1&minus;n) a measured current signal. Like the template <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A, the thresholds shown in the template <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> may be defined and adjusted by a user via the communication port <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and the display <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, and selectively stored and retrieved from non-volatile memory <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The template <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> may represent, for example, a condition where a given system or piece of equipment is susceptible to electrical damage. Thus, as illustrated by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</cross-reference>, different templates may be defined to address different alarm conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</cross-reference> illustrates a third exemplary template <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> having thresholds for the phase angle of the harmonics (i.e., 1&minus;n) of a measured current signal. As is known in the art, an individual harmonic includes both a magnitude component and a phase angle component. The template <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</cross-reference> enables a user to establish thresholds for the phase angle component of one or more harmonics. In practice, a user may establish phase angle thresholds by defining a window (i.e., a range) within which the phase angle of each harmonic must fall. Like the templates <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</cross-reference>, respectively, the thresholds shown in the template <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</cross-reference> may be defined and adjusted by a user via the communication port <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and the display <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, and selectively stored and retrieved from the non-volatile memory <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The template <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</cross-reference> may represent, for example, a condition where a given system or piece of equipment is susceptible to electrical damage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> It will be intuitive to those skilled in the art that thresholds for any desired number of harmonics, including higher harmonics, may be included in accordance with principles of the present invention. Moreover, it will be intuitive to those skilled in the art that similar template thresholds may also be constructed for voltage magnitude and voltage phase harmonics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> As previously indicated, it has been observed that certain templates may be created for certain types of devices or systems. For example, when the primary consumption of electrical power is attributable to rotating machines such as motors, specific templates may be created that are sensitive to pair patterns in harmonic content. That is, positive and negative sequence currents may occur in rotating machines when harmonic pairs such as the 5<highlight><superscript>th </superscript></highlight>and 7<highlight><superscript>th </superscript></highlight>harmonics or the 11<highlight><superscript>th </superscript></highlight>and 13<highlight><superscript>th </superscript></highlight>harmonics are present. Such interference may cause wear to the machine, and may additionally cause unstable operation such as hesitation or surging. However, the use of a proper template according to principles of the present invention can detect harmonic excesses at a specific site before significant damage or cost is incurred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> As a further example, when a meter includes communication functionality that involves a telephone system, it is necessary to avoid interference with the operation of the telephone system. Industry standards have been developed that define levels over which certain frequencies are deemed unacceptable and could cause interference with the telephone systems. Such electrical interference may be monitored by examining specific harmonic amplitudes as measured by weighting coefficients such as the known Telephone Interference Factor (TIF). Data communication applications may choose to modify one or more coefficients that are of significance for specific signals at a given site to design an optimal template. In this case, a dynamic range of 60 to 90 dB is considered useful. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> flowchart illustrating exemplary steps for practicing the present invention is shown. For purposes of example and explanation, the steps of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> will be described in relation to the electrical utility meter <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. At step <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, the microcontroller <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> receives from the DSP <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> the harmonic information or data for the current and/or voltage measurement signals and stores the same in memory such as the non-volatile memory <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. At step <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, the microcontroller <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> retrieves a particular template from a memory such as the non-volatile memory <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The retrieved template may, for example, be designated by a user via an input to the communication port <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> at the time of testing. Alternatively, the template may be retrieved in accordance with programming instructions stored in the non-volatile memory <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. As previously indicated, the retrieved template may include harmonic threshold values for current magnitude, current phase angle, voltage magnitude or voltage phase angle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, the microcontroller <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> compares the harmonic information to the thresholds in the retrieved template. At step <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, the microcontroller <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> determines whether any of the template thresholds are exceeded by the valves in the corresponding valves in the harmonic information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> If one or more of the template thresholds are exceeded, process flow advances to step <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> where the microcontroller <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> enables an alarm to be generated. As previously indicated, the alarm generated preferably corresponds to the particular template whose thresholds are exceeded. For example, if the template exceeded corresponds to a particular piece of equipment (e.g., a motor), the site where the equipment is located may be contacted via telephone or other communication means to inform the site regarding the condition. In other instances, the site may be instructed to shutdown the equipment until further notification. In less severe situations, data regarding the template threshold violations may simply be stored in a memory such as the non-volatile memory <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and communicated to the customer at a later time. The number and/or types of alarms that may be utilized in accordance with principles of the present invention is countless, and is simply a matter of design choice. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> If it is determined that none of the template thresholds are exceeded at step <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, or after an alarm is generated at step <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, process flow advances to step <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> where the microcontroller <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> determines whether to use another template for harmonic threshold testing. This determination may be made, for example, in response to a user input to the communication port <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> at the time of testing, or in accordance with programming instructions stored in the non-volatile memory <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. According to an exemplary embodiment, the microcontroller <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> may be programmed to automatically utilize a plurality of templates according to designated time intervals. For example, the microcontroller <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> may be programmed to utilize a first template at a given time, and then to utilize the same template or a different template at a predetermined time thereafter. This type of repetitive template use may be desirable in certain instances, particularly where a given site uses one or more loads that need to be continually monitored. In any event, it is contemplated that various types of programming routines for template usage may be employed according to principles of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> When the microcontroller <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> decides to use another template for harmonic threshold testing at step <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, process flow loops back to step <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the above-described process is repeated for another template. Alternatively, when the microcontroller <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> decides not to use another template, process flow advances to step <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> where the process ends. As previously indicated, it is contemplated that the foregoing steps may be repeatedly performed at designated time intervals using the same and/or different templates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> While this invention has been described as having a preferred design, the present invention can be further modified within the spirit and scope of this disclosure. This application is therefore intended to cover any variations, uses, or adaptations of the invention using its general principles. Further, this application is intended to cover such departures from the present disclosure as come within known or customary practice in the art to which this invention pertains and which fall within the limits of the appended claims. </paragraph>
