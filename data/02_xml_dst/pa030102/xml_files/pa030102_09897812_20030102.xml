<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> As can be seen by reference to the drawings, and in particularly to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the multi-level support stand that forms the basis of the present invention is designated generally by the reference number <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The support stand comprises in general a base unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a central support unit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and a plurality of rotatable support units <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. These units will now be described in seriatim fashion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> As can best be appreciated by reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, the base unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> comprises an enlarged generally flat base member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> provided with a central aperture <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> that is adapted to fixedly receive the lower portion of the central support unit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The central support unit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in turn comprises an elongated generally hollow cylindrical support member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> having a closed lower end <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> dimensioned to be received in the central aperture <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in the base member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and an open upper end <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> wherein the interior of the cylindrical support member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> defines a hollow receptacle <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> whose purpose and function will be described in greater detail further on in the specification.. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Still referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, it can be seen that each of the plurality of rotatable support units <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> comprises a circular support tray member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> having a downwardly depending stem element <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> surrounding a central aperture <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> that is dimensioned to slidably receive the cylindrical support member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the upper surface of the circular support tray member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is provided with a plurality of recesses <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> dimensioned to receive diverse articles such as foodstuffs, jewelry, etc., wherein, each of the circular support tray member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>&prime; <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>&Prime; has different diameters which decrease in proportion to the location of the particular circular support tray member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> etc., along the vertical axis of the central support member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</cross-reference>, this invention also contemplates the optional use of a decorative cap member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in conjunction with the central support member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>; wherein, the cap member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> has a lower downwardly depending stem element <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> which is dimensioned to fit into the open upper end <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the central support member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and an upper enlarged decorative element <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> which not only enhances the aesthetic appearance of the rotatable support stand <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, but also captively engages the support tray members <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>&Prime; etc., on the central support member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> As can also be appreciated by reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, when the decorative cap member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is not in use, the hollow receptacle <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> within the central support member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be filled with water to sustain cut flowers <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> whose stems are inserted into the receptacle <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> or colored marbles, crystals, etc., that would produce an aesthetically pleasing effect as viewed through the clear plastic material from which the support stand is fabricated. </paragraph>
