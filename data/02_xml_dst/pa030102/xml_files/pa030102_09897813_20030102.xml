<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> This invention is a wireless telephone communication link system for use with a set top box. This invention permits the connection between a standard set top box and the telephone line without requiring the installation of dedicated telephone wires. In its present preferred embodiment, this invention makes use of pre-existing AC power lines in the communication channel. Moreover, this invention provides easy plug-n-play installation to minimize the time required for installation personnel to connect the telephone line to the set top box. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a top-level system block diagram of the major sections of a first preferred embodiment of this invention. The set top box <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is connected, typically and preferably by a standard telephone cable <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, to a standard power line extension unit <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. The standard power line extension unit <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> converts the telephone signal from the set top box <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to a modulated power line compatible signal and couples the converted signal onto the AC power line. Typically and preferably the connection between the standard extension unit <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and the AC power line is made through a standard wall plug and socket. Also connected to the AC power line is a standard base unit <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. Connected electrically, typically via a standard electrical cable <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to the central office <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, the standard base unit <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> provides the interface, demodulation and coupling of the signals received from the set top box <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> for receipt and processing by the central office <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. The standard base unit <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> also receives control signals from the central office <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, modulates and couples the modulated control signals for transmission across the AC power line <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, where the control signals are received, decoupled and demodulated by the standard extension unit <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. Which in turn provides the control signals to the set top box <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. As can be seen by the reader, this embodiment of the invention provides the means for connected a set top box <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to a central office <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> across an AC power line <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> without requiring continuous dedicated telephone or other wiring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a top-level system block diagram of the major sections of a second preferred embodiment of this invention. In this embodiment, the set top box <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is connected <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> electrically, preferably via an RJ-11 connector, to a custom extension unit <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, which in turn couples and decouples signals to and from an AC power line <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. Also connected to the AC power line <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is a custom base unit <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>, which decouples and couples signals to and from the central office <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>, which is preferably electrically connected, via an RJ-11 connector, to the custom base unit <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. In alternative embodiments, the connection <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> between the central office <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> and the custom base unit <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> may be RF or optical or the like. Similarly, in alternative embodiments the connection <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> between the set top box <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and the custom extension unit <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> may be an RF or optical or the like channel. The custom extension unit <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> of this embodiment is similar to the standard extension unit <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and the custom base unit <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> is generally similar to the standard base unit <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, with certain costly but generally unnecessary circuitry removed. The removed circuitry includes ringer and caller identification circuitry. The custom extension unit <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is designed to be capable of initiating a call over the wireless AC power line <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> data path, although typically it does not receive an incoming call from the custom base unit <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. The custom base unit <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> is designed without the capability of initiating a call to the custom extension unit <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. By removing the ability of the custom base unit <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> to initiate a call a level of inherent security is provided. In the preferred embodiment, additional security, through encryption is provided to enhance privacy, reliability and performance. The custom base unit <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> is also adapted to terminate a wireless call from the custom extension unit <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> if an off-hook condition from another telephone device on the phone line is detected. The custom base unit <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> is also designed to not go off-hook from a request from the custom extension unit <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> if the custom base unit <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> detects another telephone device is on the line and already off-hook. The preferred data communication between the custom extension unit <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> and the custom base unit <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> is full duplex, operating at a minimum of <highlight><bold>2400</bold></highlight> baud modem data bandwidth. The present telephone line connections of the custom base unit <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> provides telephone line isolation of 68,600 ohms and 2500 VDC isolation to ground as required by FCC part 68 regulations. Signal input connections to the custom base unit <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> presents 42 volts &plus;/&minus;5 volts DC open circuit with an output impedance of 1000 ohms &plus;/&minus;5% with a minimum current limitation of 30 mA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a top-level system block diagram of the major sections of a third preferred embodiment of this invention. This embodiment incorporates an embedded extension unit <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> in a modified set top box <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. This embedded extension unit <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> connects to the AC power line <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> modulating and coupling set top box <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> initiated communication between the embedded extension unit <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and the custom base unit <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. The custom base unit <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> communicates <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> with a central office <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> as described above with regard to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. This embodiment of the invention employs a new power supply design as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Also, included in the modified set top box <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> are a power line carrier transmitter and a power line carrier receiver. The preferred power line carrier transmitter preferably includes a frequency shift key (FSK) oscillator, a buffer, a power line RF power amplifier and filters. The preferred power line carrier receiver preferably consists of an FSK receiver, filters and a data slicer. A control signal from the set top box <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> turns the transmitter on and off. Data received and transmitted between the embedded extension unit <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and the set top box <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> is preferably communicated asynchronously, with an internal processor handling the data directly. A pre-processor is preferably employed within the modified set top box <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> (or in an alternative embodiment in the embedded extension unit <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>) to handle the bus speed, to keep the power line carrier link, to interface to a bus, provide interrupts and to provide error detection/correction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows a detailed schematic of the preferred power supply modification circuit of this invention. This preferred power supply provides a connection <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> to a transmitter and a connection <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> to a receiver. A 3:1:1 Balun transformer <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> is used to couple the transformer and receiver connections <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> to the power supply. A.01 &mgr;F 250V, X-Y capacitor <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> is electrically connected to the Balun transformer <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> and to the neutral <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> line of the power supply. The other connection of the Balun transformer <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> is electrically connected to a fuse <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight> through which the voltage <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> is supplied.
