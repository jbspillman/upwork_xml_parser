The first output <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> of Splitter &num;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is received by Television &num;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The second output <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> of Splitter &num;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is received by RAM <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. A fourth signal <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> from the gateway <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is also receive by RAM <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. A fifth signal <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> from the gateway <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is input to Balun &num;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. The output <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of Balun &num;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and the output <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> of RAM <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> are received by Diplexer &num;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. The output <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> of Diplexer &num;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is connected to the input of the Main Line Splitter <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, which provides a first output <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> to a first RAP <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, the output <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> of which is provided to Television &num;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>. The second output <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of the Main Line Splitter <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is connected to Duplexer &num;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, the other input <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> of which is connected to the output of Balun &num;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. Balun &num;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> receives its input <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> from a Network Interface Device <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>. A second output <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> from Duplexer &num;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> is connected to the input of Splitter &num;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>. Splitter &num;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> provides two outputs <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. The first of these two outputs <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> is connected to a second RAP <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> which is connected <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> to Television &num;<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>.
