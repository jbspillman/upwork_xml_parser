<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This application relates to a non-intrusive method and apparatus for measuring the temperature during Electroconsolidation processes, and more particularly to such a non-intrusive method and apparatus that employs ultrasound to determine the temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The Electroconsolidation process is a method of rapid, pressure-assisted densification of preformed materials (a &ldquo;preform&rdquo;). (&ldquo;Electroconsolidation&rdquo; is a registered trademark of the Superior Graphite Co., the assignee of the present application.) It is one of several densification methods (referred to as a &ldquo;soft-tooling&rdquo; or &ldquo;pseudoisostatic&rdquo; process) that utilize particulate solids as pressure transmitting media. It differs from the other processes of this type in that the preformed part is heated by electrical resistive heating of the granular pressure transmitting medium while the medium is in contact with the preform inside the die chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In the Electroconsolidation process, the part to be densified is immersed within a bed of free-flowing, electrically conductive granular medium contained in a cylindrical die chamber. Rams acting on the medium apply pressure mechanically. Heating to the consolidation temperature is achieved by passing an electric current through the medium, causing it to be electrothermally heated. Heat transfers from the medium to the part while the part is subjected to the applied compaction pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The Electroconsolidation process is effective for rapid consolidation of a variety of materials, including powder metals, intermetallics, oxide and non-oxide ceramics, monoliths and composites, and various carbon and graphite composites. It is a candidate whenever pressure is required to achieve high density, as in making reinforced composites, or when applying pressure enables higher or comparable density to be achieved in less time and/or at lower temperature. See U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,348,694, 5,294,382 and 5,246,638, all of which are assigned to the Superior Graphite Co., and which are incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The Electroconsolidation process can be used for near net shape densification of complex shaped parts, which distinguishes the method from hot pressing. The parts to be consolidated do not require cladding, as is needed for hot isostatic pressing. Therefore, the Electroconsolidation process offers simplification and lower costs for production of large quantities of smaller, complex-shaped parts made directly to near-net shape. (</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The pressure-transmitting medium for the Electroconsolidation process must be free flowing so that it fills all voids and compresses uniformly against the contour of the part. The medium should also be chemically inert, stable at high temperatures, electrically conductive, and yet have adequate electrical resistivity to act as the resistive heating element in the circuit. It should further be resiliently compressible to allow compaction at high pressure without breakage and to release cleanly from the consolidated part when the pressure is relieved. Graphitic carbons with a high degree of internal porosity are a preferred media for this process. A spheroidal form of porous graphitic carbon (75 &mgr;m-500 &mgr;m) is particularly suited for this application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A feature that distinguishes Electroconsolidation processes from other methods is the &ldquo;inside out&rdquo; form of heating that occurs within the die by direct resistance heating of the pressure transmitting medium. This enables extremely rapid heating and processing temperatures well in excess of 2500&deg; C. The temperature capability obtainable with the Electroconsolidation process is higher than that for other pressure-assisted densification processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Commercial use of the Electroconsolidation process requires effective means to determine and control the temperature variation that is inherent with rapid resistive heating. Temperature sensors or thermocouples placed within the die chamber are not practical in normal production because of their intrusive nature and unsuitability for use in temperatures above 2000&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The velocity of sound whether in a solid, liquid, or gas, varies with temperature in a predictable manner. It increases with temperature in gases, but decreases with temperature in most solids and liquids. Based on this property, high-temperature thermometric measurements have been made in hostile environments, such as combustion furnaces. Ultrasonic time-domain reflectometers, for example, use a thin rod with one or more notches along its length. The temperature between the notches, or between a notch and the end of the rod, can be inferred by measuring the round-trip travel time of sound in the notched segment with a pulse-echo method. Although high temperatures can be measured this way using appropriate sensor material, the approach still suffers because it is intrusive, like thermocouples. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is the principal object of the present invention to provide a non-intrusive method and apparatus for measuring and controlling the temperature attained in Electroconsolidation processes. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> A basic apparatus for performing Electroconsolidation (&ldquo;EC&rdquo;) processes, generally designated <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, is shown schematically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. A preform <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> surrounded by a graphite bed pressure-transmitting medium <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is contained within a cylindrical die chamber <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Upper and lower rams, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> respectively, enter the die from both the top and bottom to apply pressure uniaxially. The rams <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are connected to low-resistance, water cooled electrically conducting blocks <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> connected by electrical leads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to a power source (not shown) to enable current to be passed through the pressure transmitting medium <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The die chamber <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and upper and lower rams <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are supported within a post and platen press <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> that has two hydraulic rods <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, through which compressive force is transmitted through the upper and lower rams <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to the pressure-transmitting medium <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the preform <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, an ultrasonic pitch-catch technique has been developed for nonintrusive measurement of the temperature of the pressure-transmitting medium in the Electroconsolidation process. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the transmitting and receiving transducers <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are placed outside the Electroconsolidation process die in the water cooled blocks <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> (preferably made of copper) where the graphite rams <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> contact the copper. Ultrasonic waves are transmitted and received along the axial direction through the graphite bed <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in which the material consolidation takes place. Because the sensor measures the average velocity of sound (and thus temperature) along the line of sight between the transducers, temperature changes during heating can be monitored and controlled. It is also possible to use multiple pairs of transducers to monitor temperature profile radially in the die, with various of the pairs being outwardly spaced from the central axis of the die. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The change in the velocity of sound with temperature can be used to determine the temperature within the Electroconsolidation process die <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> during operation. The VOS through the granular graphite is determined by measuring the travel time between the transmitted and received pulses and taking into account the travel times through the transducer blocks and graphite rams. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The transmitting and receiving transducers <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are located outside the process die <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and thus do not interfere with the process. Measuring the transit time of pulsed ultrasound along the line of sight between the transducers and knowing the path lengths, the velocity of sound in the powder bed of the die can be calculated. Because sound velocity in a particulate medium is a function of both pressure and temperature, the approach of the present invention is to measure the velocity of sound in the graphite bed as a function of temperature at different pressures and heating rates, and to then correlate the ultrasound data with temperature under certain operating conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Factors that govern the operation of the ultrasonic sensor include transducer temperature, coupling between interfaces, and wave propagation characteristics in the particulate medium. The temperature at the transducer face must stay below its design limit, which is typically around 130-150&deg; C., even though the internal temperature in the process can reach up to 3000&deg; C. To protect the transducer from the process heat, the transducer is placed over a circulating water bath within a water-cooled copper block. The transducers are located in the EC apparatus between the water-cooled electrical contact and the graphite rams at the top and bottom of the die, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the ultrasonic waves must propagate through different sections of materials and encounter several interfaces, starting from the transmitter transducer, continuing through copper, water, copper, solid graphite, graphite powder, solid graphite, copper, water, copper, and ending with the receiver transducer. Although an oil-based couplant is used between the transducer and the water chamber where the temperature is low, the coupling mechanism between the parallel faces of the transducer assembly and the graphite ram, where temperature can be high, is simply pressure. Wave scattering and attenuation occur in the particulate medium; the scattering depends on the wavelength relative to particle size and the attenuation increases with the void spaces between the particles in the graphite bed. Transmitting ultrasonic energy through the graphite bed with adequate signal-to-noise ratio therefore requires the use of either low frequency and/or application of moderate pressure to the bed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> An EC experiment starts with loading the die chamber manually with graphite powder and the preform between the upper and lower rams. This assembly is then placed between water-cooled copper blocks. The hydraulic rods apply the initial pressure. At ambient pressure, the receiver transducer does not pick up any transmitted signal because of excessive attenuation in the particulate bed. As the pressure is increased, the transmitted ultrasonic pulse begins to be received, typically above 500 psi. At approximately 1000 psi, the signal-to-noise level becomes adequate for temperature tests. Pressures of 2000-10,000 psi are generally used and are usually applied at the onset of heating. The pressure can be held constant or ramped up or down during the heating/cooling cycle. Power is applied and the current is adjusted from 1500 to 10,000 A to establish a prescribed heating rate of up to 2000&deg; C. per minute. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Typical operational variables of the EC system are die diameter, ram pressure, heating rate, and hold time. The ultrasonic sensor was tested against various test conditions. To calibrate the sensor, Type C thermocouples were placed at different locations: the center of the bed, within the ram, the outside surface of the die, and on the transducer surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows schematically the instrumentation used for the ultrasonic pitch-catch data collection. A 500 kHz tone burst signal from a function generator <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (Wavetek) is amplified by a 40 dB RF power amplifier <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> (EIN) and applied to a 500 kHz, 1 in.-diameter transmitting transducer (not shown) (Panametrics). The signal from an identical receiving transducer is amplified and filtered by a 40 dB preamplifier <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> with a band-pass filter set at 450-550 kHz. The received signal is displayed on a digital oscilloscope <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> (LeCroy) with respect to the trigger signal of the transmitter waveform. Total transit time between the pitch and catch signal is recorded corresponding to the location of the first peak of the received waveform. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The change in velocity of sound in the bed is measured as a function of temperature up to 2000&deg; C. for different pressures and heating rates. An analysis of the test data reveals that the velocity of sound versus temperature fits a quadratic curve and are reproducible among the tests if the pressure and heating rate are held constant or follow fixed trajectories. The accuracy of temperature prediction in the test range shows an uncertainty of 2.2 percent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The main variable that was monitored was the total time of flight (TOF) of ultrasonic pulses along the line of sight between the two transducer locations shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The amplitude of the received pulses was also checked for excessive attenuation of sound in the materials during heating. Tracing the path of ultrasonic waves, the total TOF is mainly constituted by the transit times in the solid graphite rams (typically 5 in. long; two sections) and in the graphite powder bed (typically 4 in. thick). The ultrasonic TOF of the top and bottom rams at ambient temperature were separately measured by using a pulse-echo technique. These times were then subtracted from the total TOF to obtain the TOF in the bed. Knowing the bed height, which is obtained from a pair of position transducers instrumented on the rams, the velocity of sound in the graphite bed is calculated by dividing the bed height by the TOF in the bed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> A pressure test was conducted to determine its effect on the velocity of sound in the bed. Because of the powder compaction, the velocity of sound increased with pressure as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Signal height also increased with pressure due to reduced attenuation. This indicates that the pressure must be held constant to determine the effect of temperature on the velocity of sound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In four experiments with a 3 in. die, the pressure was held constant at 2000 psi and monitored the TOF as heat was increased at a fixed rate of 50&deg; C./min. Three trials of fixed pressure, 17.2 Mpa (2500 psi), and controlled rate of temperature increase and decrease excursions from ambient to 800&deg; C. were done. The VOS vs. Temperature calibration curve derived from these data sets could be fitted to a quadratic equation as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. An error analysis of the data with respect to the calibration curve shows a measurement uncertainty of less than 3% or 15&deg; C. With an aim to determine the ultrasonic properties of the bed in these initial experiments, preforms were not used because they could modify the velocity of sound. Also, a fresh batch of graphite powder in each of these experiments was used to eliminate any hysteresis effect. The total TOF showed a steady decrease during heating, and the velocity of sound calculation for the bed showed similar slopes for all cases. However, the starting points, namely the velocity values at ambient temperature, were different among the tests; this may be due to how the particles were initially packed in the bed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In four further experiments, a 0.127-m die, differing pressures, and two heating rates were used, and the tests were conducted with and without preforms. For the preform, a 90%-dense SiC disk, 0.0254 m in diameter and 0.0048-m thick was used. In one test, a pressure step of 13.79 Mpa up to 850&deg; C. and 27.58 Mpa thereafter, up to 2000&deg; C., was used. Because a step change in pressure introduces a step change in the velocity of sound, the offset between various pressures was corrected with reference to a value that corresponded to 13.79 Mpa. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows the offset-corrected plots of heating and cooling curves for these tests. Note that the heating curves are grouped according to the heating rate and that the slopes of the 50&deg; C./min heating curves are higher than those of the 100&deg; C./min curves. This change in slope with heating rate appears to be due to the change in the axial temperature profiles with the heating rate and to the sensor&apos;s averaging effect. Typically, the temperature peaks at the center of the bed and tapers off on both sides along the axial direction. Because the temperature gradient becomes steeper with the heating rate, a line integral of the temperature would therefore give a lower average value for a faster heating rate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> There is consistently a strong hysteresis between the heating and cooling phase in the first heating-cooling cycle, but as seen in the test corresponding to 10.34 Mpa, this hysteresis nearly disappeared in the second heating-cooling cycle. The hysteresis is attributed to possible powder lockup during thermal expansion, which changes the elastic and relaxation properties of the powder, and also to the various rates of heating and cooling. However, from the process control standpoint, the reproducibility of velocity data during the first heating phase will suffice. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> gives a quadratic calibration curve derived from the tests for the 0.127-m die at a 50&deg; C./min heating rate. Error analysis reveals that temperature can be predicted by this method with an uncertainty of &lt;2.2% for temperatures up to 2000&deg; C. in a 0.127-m die. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In two further experiments, attempts were made to take the system to the highest possible temperature by using a 0.0762-m-diameter, 0.0095-m-thick graphite preform in a 0.127-m die. Because the Type C thermocouple that was used will fail to work at these high temperatures, it was placed at a location in the ram where the temperature is lower, by recessing it 0.0127-m from the hot face along the central axis. These tests were nearly identical; keeping the pressure constant at 6.895 Mpa, the applied electrical current was varied to a maximum of 10,000 A and was held there for some time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The heating trajectory for one of the tests, in terms of thermocouple reading vs. heating time, is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. Heating rates as a function of time in these experiments followed a sigmoidal function, with a slow rate in the beginning and end and&ap;75&deg; C./min in the middle. In principle, to predict temperature from ultrasonic velocity, a calibration curve must be obtained that corresponds to the new heating trajectory. Because independent temperature data inside the bed for this calibration was lacking, the calibration curve that corresponds to a 50&deg; C./min heating rate in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> was chosen. This curve is given by the quadratic equation: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>V&equals;V</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>&minus;0.0008 <highlight><italic>T&plus;</italic></highlight>0.0001 <highlight><italic>T</italic></highlight><highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> where V is the velocity of sound in m/s, V<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>is the initial velocity at the ambient temperature, and T is the temperature in Celsius. Knowing V<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>and V from the ultrasonic velocity measurements in the bed, temperature T vs. time was calculated and plotted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, along with the thermocouple readings. To verify the consistency of prediction, the predicted temperatures for the final two tests were plotted against the readings of a thermocouple located at the same position in the ram. Considering the difficulty of maintaining identical heating trajectories between two tests, the reproducibility of data is very good. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Once the bed temperature is determined, as set forth above, this information may be utilized in a control system to automatically control the amount of current input to the die. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, there is seen a block diagram of a single-loop feedback control system for control of the temperature in an Electroconsolidation die. As described above, the temperature of the graphite bed pressure transmitting medium is determined based on the velocity of sound through the bed (as fitted to the quadratic equation whose constants are determined by calibration), and this value is then used in the feed-back loop of the temperature control system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Turning again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10, a</cross-reference> temperature setting T<highlight><subscript>s </subscript></highlight>is input through a &ldquo;PID&rdquo; (proportional, integral and derivative) controller <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. A control signal is sent to the power supply to direct a predetermined amount of current to the Electroconsolidation die <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The temperature of the bed is then determined by the measurement of the velocity of sound (VOS) between the transducers <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, the velocity of sound being converted to a measured temperature T<highlight><subscript>m </subscript></highlight>for the bed (based upon fitting the velocity to the calibration curve <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>). The measured temperature T<highlight><subscript>m </subscript></highlight>is then compared to the set temperature T<highlight><subscript>s</subscript></highlight>. If the measured temperature is less than the set temperature, the PID controller <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> will cause the power supply <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to increase the current to the die <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Conversely, if the measured temperature is greater than the set temperature, the controller <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> will cause the power supply <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to reduce the current to the die <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Thus, the process temperature can be controlled to follow the desired heating trajectory for the proper sintering of materials placed in the bed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Thus, a novel method and apparatus have been provided for use in Electroconsolidation methods and devices. While the invention has been described in conjunction with Electroconsolidation process, the ultrasonic sensor with suitable modification can be used in various other applications that deal with high temperatures and hostile environments. Some of the direct extensions of this idea would include diagnostic sensors for sintering of parts in powder metallurgy and hot pressing. Because the velocity of sound in a solid graphite material is found to increase with temperature, a graphite rod with suitable coating for protection from oxidation can be used as a waveguide sensor to measure temperature in high-temperature environments. Another extension of this concept is to use nonreacting powder materials as a coupling medium for ultrasonic interrogation of materials at high temperatures, e.g., plasma sintering. </paragraph>
