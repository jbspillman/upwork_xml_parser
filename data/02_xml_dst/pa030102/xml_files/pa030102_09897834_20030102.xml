<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to support systems, and more particularly, to an adjustable support system having multi-dimensional adjustability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention was developed to solve a problem associated with roofing and other house repairs that require workers to walk or otherwise be supported by breakable tiles on a roof, particularly one that is sloped. For example, when a house is fumigated, a fumigation bag or enclosure is used to cover the house. In order to install the fumigation bag, it is often times necessary for workers to walk on the roof in order to fully cover the entire house. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> One known method that helps to protect the tiles is the use of a flat board or panel (1 feet by 4 feet, for example) having foam under it. This structure helps to spread out the weight of workers. However, it has been found that tiles are still broken using this structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Unfortunately, workers that do not have a great deal of experience working on roofs, or in situations where roof tiles are relatively fragile, many roof tiles are broken during the bag installation procedure. Similar situations may occur during window washing, aftermarket gutter installation, and antenna installation, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The cost of repairing the broken roof tiles is expensive, many time on the order of the cost of the job that is being performed. The present invention substantially eliminates the occurrence of broken roof tiles during roof-related operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In addition, there may be times when articles need to be stored or carried where the surface is not level or two mounting locations are not at the same height. In such a situation, it is often difficult to efficiently store or carry an object. The present invention is also designed to provide a solution for these problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an objective of the present invention to provide for an adjustable support system having multi-dimensional adjustability. It is also an objective of the present invention to provide for an adjustable support system that may be employed to support people and objects above a surface. It is also an objective of the present invention to provide for an adjustable support system that may be employed to support people and objects where the surface on which the support system is placed in not horizontal or where support locations are not at the same height. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides for an adjustable support system having multidimensional adjustability. An exemplary adjustable support system comprises first and second offset support members. Each support member comprises a base that may be secured to a surface or object. The base preferably has one or more holes that allow it to be secured to the surface or object. The base comprises a U-shaped member or similar functioning bracket that projects away from a surface thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A first member, which is preferably tubular, is rotatably attached and secured to the base, such as to the U-shaped member or bracket, of each support member. A second member, which is also preferably tubular, is slidably attached to the first member of each support member. A protective cap, or other resilient member, for example, may be disposed to cover the exposed end of the second members. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The first and second members are thus slidable or adjustable with respect to each other so that the distal end of the second member may be positioned at different distances from the base. The first and second members may be locked in a desired position by means of a locking mechanism such as a bolt and nut, that extends through holes in the first and second members. Multiple sets of holes may be disposed through the first and second member that permit locking of the second member at different positions. The positions that the second member with respect to the first member are locked at may be different for each of the support members. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A first transverse member is attached to the second member of the first support member. A second transverse member is attached to the second member of the second support member. The first transverse member is slidable or adjustable with respect to the second transverse member. This allows for lateral or transverse positioning of the first and second support members at different distances from each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> If first and second tubular transverse members are used, the first and second support members may be rotated with respect to each other around axes of the if the first and second tubular transverse members. This, in conjunction with the rotatable joint provided between the base and the first member, allows one of the support members to be secured to a different surface than that of the other support member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment of the support system, the transverse member of one of the support members has one or more holes therethrough (depending upon whether it is tubular or solid) that is distal from the second member. In this alternative embodiment, the transverse member is rotatably attached and secured directly to the base, such as to the U-shaped member or bracket thereof by means of a locking mechanism such as a bolt and nut. Thus, in this alternative embodiment, the base is removed from one of the support members and is attached to the transverse member of the other support member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> An optional rotatable member may be rotatably and/or slidably coupled at a first end to one of the transverse members. A second end of the rotatable member preferably has a hole therein that allows it to be secured to a surface. Use of the rotatable member helps to stabilize the adjustable support system.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> A preferred embodiment of the exemplary adjustable support system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises first and second support members <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> that are offset from each other. The first and second support members <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> each comprise a base <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that may be secured to a surface or object. The base <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> preferably has a plurality of holes <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> therethough that allow it to be secured to the surface or object. The base <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> comprises a U-shaped member <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> or other similarly functioning bracket <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> that projects away from a surface thereof. The U-shaped member <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> or bracket <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may be part of the base <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (formed by casting, for example) or may be secured to the base <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by one or more welds <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, for example. The U-shaped member <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> or bracket <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of a reduced to practice embodiment of the adjustable support system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises an L-shaped bracket and a vertical tab, which are welded to the base <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and to each other (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> A first or inner member <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, which is preferably tubular, is rotatably attached to the U-shaped member <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> or bracket <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of each support member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> at a joint. Different first or inner tubular member <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> may have different lengths, which allow each support member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to have selected overall lengths. Typical lengths of the first or inner member <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of reduced to practice embodiments are from about 6 to 12 inches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The first or inner tubular member <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> may be rotatably secured to the U-shaped member <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> using a locking mechanism <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> such as a bolt <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> that extends through holes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in the first or tubular member <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and holes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the U-shaped member <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> or bracket <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and a nut <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> that is tightened onto the bolt <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the joint may be formed as a lockable ball joint, for example that is attached to the end of the first or inner member <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> A second or outer tubular member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is slidably attached to the first or inner tubular member <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of each support member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. A protective cap <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, or other resilient member <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, for example, may be disposed to cover the exposed end of the respective second or outer tubular members <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The inner and outer (first and second) tubular members <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are thus slidable with respect to each other and the outer (second) tubular member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> may be positioned at different distances from the base <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The inner and outer (first and second) tubular members <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> may also be locked in a desired position such as by means of a locking mechanism <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> such as a bolt <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, for example, that extends through holes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in the inner and outer (first and second) tubular members <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and a nut <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> that is tightened onto the bolt <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Multiple sets of holes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are disposed through the inner (first) tubular member <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> that permit locking of the support member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> at different positions. The positions that the outer (second) tubular member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> with respect to the inner (first) tubular member <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are locked at may be different for the respective support members <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The inner and outer (first and second) tubular members <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> need not necessarily be tubular, and may be flat members <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> with one more holes therein that permit the inner and outer (first and second) tubular members <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to be secured together to provide a structure having different overall lengths. Furthermore, the inner and outer (first and second) tubular members <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> may be threaded to allow relative positioning thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, it illustrates details of an alternative embodiment of the adjustable support system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and in particular support members <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> that employ threaded tubular members <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The threaded tubular members <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> may be secured together by means of a rotatable locking mechanism <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>such as a threaded collar <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>that is rotated along the threaded inner (first) tubular member <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> until it is locked tightly against the outer (second) tubular member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to prevent movement thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> A first transverse member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is attached to the outer (second) tubular member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> (or flat member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>) of the first support member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. A second transverse member <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is attached to the outer (second) tubular member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> (or flat member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>) of the second support member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. This interconnection is illustrated by the dashed (phantom) nut, bolt and hole locations <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The first transverse member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is slidable with respect to the second transverse member <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. This allows for lateral or transverse positioning of the first and second support members <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> at different distances from each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> If the first and second transverse members <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> are tubular (circular), the first and second support members <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may be rotated with respect to each other around axes of the if the first and second transverse tubular members <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. This, in conjunction with the rotatable joint provided between the base <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the inner (first) tubular member <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, allows one of the support members <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to be secured to a different surface than that of the other support member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> An optional rotatable member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, or kicker <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, may be coupled at a first end to the outer transverse member <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. A second end <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> of the rotatable member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> preferably has a hole <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>therein that allows it to be secured to a surface. Use of the rotatable member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, or kicker <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, helps to stabilize the adjustable support system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> when it is secured to one or more surfaces. If flat transverse members <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> are employed, then the rotatable member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be hinged and attached to one or both of the flat transverse members <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The components of each support member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> including the inner and outer (first and second) members <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the base <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> including the bracket <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and the first and second transverse members <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, and the optional rotatable member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, or kicker <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, may be made from metal such as stainless steel, galvanized steel or aluminum, for example. Reduced to practice embodiments of the adjustable support system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> were made from galvanized steel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates use of the exemplary adjustable support system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in a typical roofing application. In such a typical roofing application, it is necessary for workers to walk onto a sloped roof <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of a building <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, such as a house or apartment roof <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The workers are normally required to walk or otherwise be supported by breakable tiles <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> on the roof <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. For example, this is typically required if the house <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is fumigated, or if window washing, gutter installation, or antenna installation, is required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In using the present invention, several tiles <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are removed from the roof <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> or lifted and rotated or slid out of the way, to expose the underlying protective paper or wood, as is shown by the exposed areas of the roof <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> identified by reference numeral <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. The respective support members <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of each adjustable support system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is secured to the exposed areas <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of the roof <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, by means of wood screws, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In this illustrative example, since the roof <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is sloped, the lower support member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of each adjustable support system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is extended so that the transverse members <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> are generally horizontal. Then a plank <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, for example, such as a two-by-eight, two-by-ten or two-by-twelve wood beam, for example, is laid on top of the respective transverse members <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> to provide a walking surface for the workers. Thus, since the workers are supported by the plank <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> above the roof <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the roof tiles <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are not damaged by the workers while work is done of the house <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Although the adjustable support systems <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are shown so that the plank <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is oriented laterally across the roof <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, they may readily be secured in a direction that is transverse to, or angularly different from, the one shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference>. Thus, two adjustable support systems <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be secured to top and bottom areas <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of the roof <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> so that the plank <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> extends in a direction that is transverse to the one shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Also, since the adjustable support systems <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be adjusted by appropriately rotating the joints and sliding the components along their slidable axes or surfaces, the plank <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may be supported in any arbitrary direction with respect to the roof <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates an alternative embodiment of the adjustable support system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment of the support system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the transverse member <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> (or <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>) of one of the support members <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has one or more holes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>therethrough (depending upon whether it is tubular or solid) that is distal from the outer (second) tubular member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> (or flat member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>). The transverse member <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is rotatably attached and secured directly to the base <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, such as to the U-shaped member <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> or bracket <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> thereof by means of a locking mechanism <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> such as a bolt <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and nut <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Thus, in this embodiment, the base <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> s removed from one of the support members <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and is attached to the transverse member <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the other support member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The use of the adjustable support system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is not limited to use in only roofing applications. The adjustable support system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be attached to a vehicle, such as a truck, for example, to permit ladders or other materials to be supported by and locked thereto so that they may be transported. For example, a typical roof rack attached to a truck has fore and aft lateral tubes or bars that extend across the back of the truck at a predetermined height above the bed. An adjustable support system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, in an inverted position, may be secured to the fore and aft lateral tube or bar by means of a U-bolt, for example. The length of the respective transverse members <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is chosen so that the support members <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are separated by a desired distance. The separation of the support members <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is chosen to allow ladders, wood or other object(s) to rest on and be supported by the transverse members <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> of the fore and aft adjustable support systems <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Thus, an improved adjustable support system has been disclosed. It is to be understood that the above-described embodiments are merely illustrative of some of the many specific embodiments that represent applications of the principles of the present invention. Clearly, numerous and other arrangements can be readily devised by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the invention. </paragraph>
