<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A gasket for a pipe joint includes an annular gasket body which is symmetrical around an axial centerline and is therefore insensitive to axial orientation. The gasket is formed of a resilient material and includes a base adapted to sealingly engage an annular groove formed in one of the pipe segments to be joined. First and second protrusions run along the length of the gasket body and extend radially therefrom. The first and second projections are spaced apart symmetrically about the centerline. An annular bore, bisected by the center line, extends within the interior of the gasket body, and comprises a central region bridging first and second transversely spaced apart lobes. It is particularly suited for sealing an annular space in a bell-and-spigot pipe joint and provides an increased surface contact area to compensate for defects in the sealing surfaces of the pipes. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to flexible fluid-type seals for pipe joints. More particularly, the invention relates to a gasket adapted for sealing bell-and-spigot type pipe joints. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The gasket disclosed herein is particularly adapted for use in the field of sewer pipe assemblies. However, it should be appreciated that the gasket design disclosed could be adapted for use in many other types of pipe joints as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Sewer pipe assemblies are generally made of plastic, polyethylene, metal, concrete, or other suitable materials. These are fabricated in many configurations and sizes to meet specific requirements and users&apos; preferences. In many such pipe assemblies, grooves are formed or recesses are provided in ribbed or corrugated types of pipe. Although a spigot, i.e., a male groove, is the dominant method employed for manufacturing sewer pipes, it is also possible that a formed groove in the bell, i.e., female pipe, can be utilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Some gaskets are integrally installed at the factory during fabrication of the sewer pipes while others are simply applied at the job site. For very large diameter concrete pipes, such as in storm and sanitary sewer systems, field installation of the gaskets is generally considered necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Historically, piping systems have utilized polymeric gasket elements to provide resilient seals under various operating conditions. These include no internal pressure, no external pressure, working internal pressure, high external pressure, internal vacuum, or any combination of these. In each case, the gasket must maintain its ability to seal when quick changes occur in the pressures imposed on the gasket. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> O-ring type gaskets have frequently been employed on large diameter pipe joints. The O-ring is typically mounted on the spigot, and the spigot is then pushed into the bell causing the O-ring to roll further onto the spigot until it reaches roughly the center of the pipe connection. Dirty or uneven surfaces, poor or improperly applied lubricants, misaligned pipes, and excessive force may cause the O-ring to distort non-uniformly, resulting in a weak seal, or even in a void through which fluids can flow. Some spigots include a circumferential groove or a single or a double offset shoulder to keep the O-ring from rolling as the pipes are interconnected. However, the diameter of the O-ring and its radial cross-section are usually greater than the depth of the groove or shoulder and the ring may still roll over the inside edge of the groove, become snagged or shear off segments of the O-ring as the spigot enters the bell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Various gasket configurations have been used or suggested for overcoming these deficiencies. In order to provide self-alignment of the gasket, various gasket profiles have been developed. Typically, however, it is essential that the gasket be placed on the spigot in a desired orientation. That is, the gasket functions properly only when it is installed in a particular direction and cannot function if installed in a reverse or backwards manner. This has made it necessary for identification marks to be placed on the surface of the gasket for the purpose of distinguishing the front, or functional side, of the gasket profile from the back, or non-functional side. These stripes, printing, or color coding identifiers then become critical to the success or failure of the sealing system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Sealing rings are known for sealing against fluid flow in both high and low pressure conditions in either direction. However, these sealing rings are not symmetrical and, therefore, can be installed incorrectly so that they will not seal properly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> There are symmetrical gaskets known for pipe joints. In commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 5,687,976, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference, there is disclosed a symmetrical pipe joint gasket which includes an annular gasket body formed of a resilient material. The gasket includes a projection which extends radially away from the gasket body and an annular bore which is spaced away from the projection and which extends in the gasket body. Both the projection and the annular bore are located so that they are bisected by the centerline of the gasket profile. The gasket is insensitive to axial orientation and is able to react to pressure fluctuations. It will be recognized that the gaskets in accordance with the present invention have many of the attendant advantages of those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,687,976. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Certain problems exist in pipe manufacturing processes that result in conditions which provide ineffective sealing surfaces on the portion of the pipe which contacts the gasket. Such surface conditions include, pitting, crazing, raised bumps, waviness, flow marks, indentations, undispersed ingredients that come to the surface, and other such conditions where the pipe surfaces are not as smooth and consistent as desired. Such defects have the ability to cause a weak seal or a failure in the pipe joint, especially under conditions of internal pressures, external pressures, and internal vacuums. The failures occur since a pathway for liquid or air is created over, under, or around these surface imperfections. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Typically, many pipe joints are disqualified because of these results. Although the pipe may be otherwise fully acceptable, a minor imperfection on the sealing surface where the gasket contacts the pipe may result in a failure. If the gasket chosen cannot overcome this type of operating challenge, increased costs to the pipe producer, contractor, and ultimately the property owner, result. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Since minor surface conditions will arise in some of the many, many miles of pipe produced each year, a gasket sealing system which can overcome such defects would be of assistance to manufacturers and users of such piping installations by providing additional confidence and reliability and preventing major problems in the field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it has been considered desirable to develop a new and improved gasket and pipe joint design which would overcome the foregoing difficulties and others while providing increased seal efficiency under higher operating pressures and other benefits. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, a gasket and pipe joint employing the same is provided having increased surface contact area and force. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a first aspect of the present invention, a pipe joint comprises an outer pipe and an inner pipe inserted therein, wherein an annular groove is formed on one of the facing surfaces of the outer and inner pipes. A gasket positioned within the annular groove is adapted to provide a seal between the inner and outer pipes. The gasket comprises an annular gasket body formed of a resilient material and is symmetric about a centerline. The gasket body includes a base adapted to sealingly engage the groove, and has first and second projections or protrusions which run longitudinally along the gasket body and extend away therefrom. The first and second projections are located on opposed sides of the centerline. An annular bore, extending interiorly within the gasket body, comprises a central region bridging first and second spaced apart lobes, the bore being located in the gasket body such that it is bisected by the centerline thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In a second aspect, a non-directional gasket which is insensitive to axial gasket orientation includes an annular gasket body which is formed of a resilient material, and which has an axial centerline and a base adapted to sealingly engage an annular groove on a pipe. First and second protrusions are symmetrically spaced apart about the centerline, and an annular bore extends in the gasket body. The bore includes a central region bridging first and second spaced apart lobes and is bisected by the centerline. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In a third aspect, a gasket for sealing an annular space in a bell-and-spigot pipe joint is provided which can be installed in an associated pipe joint in either direction along a longitudinal axis of the associated pipe joint. The gasket includes an annular elastomeric web having an inner peripheral surface formed to sealingly engage an outer periphery of an associated spigot. The web is symmetric about a centerline, and first and second elastomeric protrusions are symmetrically contraposed thereabout. The protrusions project outward from the web and are deflectable to engage an inner periphery of an associated bell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In a fourth aspect of the present invention, a pipe joint which can accommodate surface defects in a joined sealing surface includes an outer pipe and an inner pipe inserted into the outer pipe, wherein one of the pipes comprises an annular groove. A gasket positioned within the annular groove is adapted to provide a seal between the outer pipe and the inner pipe. The gasket includes an annular gasket body formed of a resilient material and is transversely symmetrical about a centerline. The gasket includes a base portion adapted to sealingly engage the groove. First and second projections run along the gasket body and extend away therefrom the first and second projections being symmetrically spaced apart about the centerline and defining a recess therebetween. The gasket body is deformable to increase a surface contact area when the inner pipe is inserted into the outer pipe. An annular bore extends in the gasket body. The bore is adapted to equalize pressure in transverse fashion across the surface contact area when the inner pipe is inserted into the outer pipe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In a fifth aspect, an improved method is provided for producing an annular gasket of a type for sealing a gap between an inner pipe and an outer pipe, wherein one of the pipes carries a gasket within an annular groove. The gasket comprises a first end engaging the groove and a second end disposed opposite the first end facing an aligned sealing surface of the other of the inner and outer pipes. The method includes producing an elongate gasket, formed from an elastically compressible material, as by molding or extrusion, and attaching opposite ends of the gasket. At the same time that the elongate gasket is being produced, first and second projections are provided running along the gasket body and extending away therefrom, and the first and second projections being symmetrically spaced apart about an axial centerline of the gasket. Also produced at the same time the gasket body is being produced is an annular bore extending in the gasket body, the bore comprising a central region bridging first and second spaced apart lobes, the bore being located in the gasket body such that it is bisected by the centerline. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In a sixth aspect, a method for increasing the surface contact area of a gasket sealing a space between an inner pipe segment and an outer pipe segment adapted to receive the inner pipe comprises forming, at the same time the gasket is formed, first and second projections running along the gasket and extending radially therefrom. The first and second projections are symmetrically spaced apart about a centerline of the gasket. At the same time the gasket is formed, an annular bore is formed in the gasket. The bore comprises a central region bridging first and second spaced apart lobes, the bore being located within the gasket body such that it is bisected by the centerline. An annular groove is formed on one of the inner and outer pipes and the gasket is installed therein such that it is positioned within the annular groove. The inner pipe is then inserted into the outer pipe to compress the gasket and to provide a sealing pressure between the inner and outer pipes.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the drawings, wherein the showings are for purposes of illustrating several preferred embodiments of the invention only and not for purposes of limiting same, and further wherein like reference numerals and characters are used to denote like components throughout the several views, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a pipe joint A including a first, female pipe B (bell), a second, male pipe C (spigot), and a gasket D meant for sealing between the two pipes. Gasket D is shown in its compressed configuration. While the pipe joint is illustrated to be of the bell-and-spigot type which is generally used in sewer pipe assemblies, it should be appreciated by those of average skill in the art that the gasket illustrated herein could be used in other types of sealing environments as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> With reference now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, the gasket D, shown in the uncompressed state, comprises an elongate annular gasket body or web <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. An axial centerline <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> bisects the gasket profile and axial extension of the centerline defines a plane of transverse symmetry of the gasket thereabout. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The gasket body includes a base portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and an oppositely disposed upper (in the orientation shown) portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> having two protrusions <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> symmetrically disposed about centerline <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The protrusions run longitudinally along the length of the gasket body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and extend outwardly, i.e., generally in the direction of the sealing force. A recess <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is defined between the protrusions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;base portion&rdquo; is intended to refer generally to the end of the gasket body which is intended to engage a complimentary depression in a pipe section (preferably in the male or spigot portion) forming a pipe joint, i.e., the proximal end of the annular gasket. The term &ldquo;upper portion&rdquo; is intended to refer to generally to the opposite end, which in operation is disposed toward an opposing surface of a pipe segment (preferably the female or bell portion) forming a pipe joint, i.e., the distal end of the annular gasket. The distinction, being made solely for ease of exposition, is general with there being no intention of defining a clear line of demarcation between the base and upper portions, such portions being integrally formed with each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The upper portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> also comprises transversely extending first and second wings or lips <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The first and second lips are symmetrically located about the centerline <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Extending axially through the upper portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is a channel or bore <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The axial channel <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> comprises a central region <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> bridging first and second transversely spaced apart lobes <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The axial channel <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is symmetrical about the axial centerline <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The lobes <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> extend toward the spaced apart protrusions <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, respectively, from within the gasket body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Extending axially through the base <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is an optional aperture <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, which is bisected by the axial centerline <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the aperture is illustrated to be elliptical in cross-sectional shape, although circular and other geometrical cross-sectional shapes are also contemplated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The gasket body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is manufactured from a suitable conventional elastomeric material in a conventional manner, such as by extrusion, molding, and the like. The two ends of the gasket body are then secured together to form a toroidal shape as is well known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The material forming the gasket may be, for example, a synthetic or natural elastomeric or rubber material. Exemplary elastomeric materials which may be used in making the gasket include, but are not limited to, polyisoprene, neoprene, butadiene-acrylonitrile copolymers, ethylene-butadiene block copolymers, ethylene-propylene based copolymers, natural rubber, polychloroprene rubber, polyisoprene-isobutylene copolymers, silicone rubber, styrene-acrylonitrile copolymers, styrene-butadiene copolymers, styrene-maleic anhydride copolymers, and so forth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> A series of compression points are located on the gasket body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. These comprise a first compression point <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> located at the apex of the first protrusion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, a second compression point <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> located at the apex of the second protrusion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a third compression point <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> located at the lip <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, a fourth compression <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> point located at the lip <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and a fifth compression point <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> located at the lowest point of the base <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. A pair of optional sealing lips <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> on opposite sides of base portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> provide additional contact points to effect sealing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> With reference now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, the gasket is meant to be used between the first pipe B and the second pipe C. The first pipe, or outer pipe, includes a bell <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> having an internal wall surface <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The second pipe, or inner pipe, includes an external wall surface <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and an internal wall surface <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> between which is defined a groove <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> which is generally U-shaped in cross-section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>C illustrate a manner of assembling the pipe joint A in accordance with the present invention. The gasket D is placed in the groove <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>. The groove <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and the gasket D are sized such that once the gasket is so located, even in an uncompressed state, the third, fourth, and fifth compression points <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are in contact with the respective wall surfaces of the inner or second pipe C that define the U-shaped groove <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>B, the second pipe C is inserted into the first pipe B in the direction <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> indicated. The sealing elements of the gasket are forced against the pipe surfaces during installation. The dual protrusions <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> compress or deform to create an increased surface contact area when they are displaced in cooperation with the bore <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to conform to the annular space of the joint area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> As the second pipe C is inserted, the first protrusion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> pushes against the inner surface <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the first pipe B, creating a mechanical force thereagainst. Upon further insertion, the second protrusion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> also pushes against the inner surface <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the first pipe B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The increased contact pressure or force provided by the gasket of the present invention is the result of a pressure transference from one side of the bore <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to the other, forcing the gasket to move against the surfaces as the coupling or installation load increases. As the second pipe C is fully inserted into the first pipe B (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</cross-reference>), the pressure substantially equalizes across the gasket and the increased force exerted in opposing directions is realized. This effect, then, allows the gasket to seal across a wider contact footprint than would typically be achieved with the prior art designs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The increased surface contact area provided by the spaced apart deformable protrusions facilitates effective sealing in a piping system, even where surface defects or imperfections, may exist on the sealing surfaces of the pipe. Such defects include, for example, pitting, crazing, raised bumps, waviness, flow marks, indentations, undispersed ingredients that come to the surface, and the like. In this manner, a fully functional seal can be formed from pipe segments which would otherwise be disqualified due to such imperfections on the sealing surface of the pipe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Hydraulic seal elements, such as lips <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> on the upper portion and lips <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> on the base portion, provide additional sealing benefits, including increased seal efficiencies under higher operating pressures. That is to say, the gasket contact pressure on the surfaces to be sealed increase as fluid pressures (internal or external) or internal vacuums are exerted on the gasket. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The incorporation of multiple hydraulic and compression areas on the gasket D allows for sealing capabilities in both a non-pressure environment or a low pressure environment, while the gasket is in compression, as well as in a pressurized condition, i.e., when the pressure on the gasket is hydraulically induced. Hydraulic and compression areas in the gasket are advantageously provided due to the increasing use of lower operating pressure sewer pipe lines. In such systems, the primary function of the gasket is low pressure sealing. However, when pressure fluctuations occur which put higher demands on the gasket, the gasket must be able to react in an acceptable and efficient manner and maintain a reliable seal under changing conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The provision of dual protrusions on the gasket and the cooperating transversely extending bore in the gasket body provides an increased surface contact area to facilitate effective sealing in a piping system, even when the pipe joint sealing surfaces are not optimal. In this manner, the subject gasket can be used even when pipes have undesirable surface conditions or when the surfaces are otherwise not as smooth and consistent as desired to achieve a functional seal. Likewise, upon activation of the pipe line, the hydraulic sealing elements provide increased sealing efficiency when exposed to increasing sealing pressures. All of the foregoing is achieved in a gasket design which is not dependent on direction, since the gasket is symmetrical and the web is formed to fit in grooves in either axial direction. </paragraph>

Likewise, the embodiments P-R illustrate a second general preferred configuration of said axially extending channel which is generally sickle- or crescent-shaped in cross section. The embodiment N illustrates a third generally preferred configuration thereof, which can be described as being somewhat canoe-shaped in cross section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> With reference now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, another type of pipe joint is illustrated which employs a main gasket T, in accordance with a further embodiment of the present invention. The gasket T is a variation of the gasket J, shown and described above by way of reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, and which differs therefrom in that has a greater transverse width; also the gasket T and is shown with an optional base channel <highlight><bold>1538</bold></highlight> that is elliptical in cross section, whereas the corresponding channel <highlight><bold>638</bold></highlight> of the gasket J has a circular cross-section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> The gasket T is seated in a first annular groove <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> formed in a male or second pipe C&Prime;. The pipe joint further comprises a supplemental gasket S seated in a second annular groove <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>. The supplemental gasket S is advantageously a symmetrical gasket of a type shown an described in the aforementioned U.S. Pat. No. 5,687,976. The gaskets L and S are shown in their uncompressed state, with the relative placement of a first pipe B&Prime; shown in phantom lines. In assembly of the pipe joint, the gaskets L and S are compressed to provide a sealing interference between their respective grooves and an inner surface <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> of the pipe section B&Prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Thus, there has been described new and improved gaskets for pipe joints, as well as pipe joints and methods employing the same. The gaskets of the present invention are particularly suited for mounting in storm or sanitary sewer pipes that have a bell-and-spigot type joint. The gaskets are insensitive to axial orientation and can be installed in either axial orientation in a pipe joint. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The gaskets of the present invention provide certain advantages over prior art gasket designs, such as increased surface contact area or footprint, or increased contact force or pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> The gaskets of the present invention may advantageously be employed to maintain a seal in non- or low-pressure environments, i.e., in compression, as well as in pressurized environments, i.e., under hydraulic induced internal or external pressures and internal vacuums. The subject gaskets may also be employed to facilitate a seal where a defect exists in the surface condition of the pipes to be joined. This reduces the failure rate of the pipe joints and the number of pipe segments disqualified due to such imperfections, thus decreasing costs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The invention has been described with reference to several preferred embodiments. Obviously, modifications and alterations will occur to others upon the reading and understanding of this specification. It is intended to include all such modifications and alterations insofar as they come within the scope of the appended claims or the equivalents thereof. </paragraph>
