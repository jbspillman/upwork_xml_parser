<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to the field of contamination detection devices. More specifically, the present invention relates to a detector that detects residual hydrocarbon contamination on a surface. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Parts and equipment cleaning is an integral part of a wide range of major industries such as aerospace, electronics equipment and computer manufacture, medical equipment manufacture, chemical manufacturing, and so forth. Indeed many applications of machined parts require the utmost cleanliness in the part exterior surfaces for successful application in their intended use. In all of these industry segments, large quantities of hazardous solvents are routinely employed, and eventually find their way into a waste stream, or are emitted into the air. Two major solvent waste generating mechanisms include unnecessary overcleaning and undercleaning. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In order to minimize cleaning problems, some industries use procedures that overclean most parts in the hopes of adequately cleaning all of the parts. Unfortunately, large volumes of hazardous and volatile solvents are often wasted when overcleaning parts. Solvents are also wasted through the use of improper undercleaning procedures. That is, industrial parts that were improperly cleaned the first time, i.e., undercleaned, must be recleaned, which further generates solvent waste. The solvents wasted through the practices of overcleaning and recleaning parts exacerbate the problem of water and air pollution by cleaning solvents. To avoid such waste, industry leaders are continually seeking to use cleaning solvents in as efficient and conservative a manner as possible by improving cleaning solvents and parts cleaning procedures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Hydrocarbon-based cleaning solvents are often used to clean the exterior surfaces of machined parts following manufacture. Improper cleaning procedures, both overcleaning and rework due to undercleaning, can result in a residual layer of hydrocarbon contamination from the cleaning solvent itself on the surface of the machined part. Residual hydrocarbon contamination can cause quality and reliability problems with the machined parts, resulting in costly, and sometimes dangerous, parts failure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Verification techniques for detecting hydrocarbon contamination and other contaminants on machined parts are sometimes used to ensure the efficacy of cleaning procedures. Unfortunately, the verification techniques involve lengthy and error prone analytical laboratory procedures. Due to the expense and delay of such laboratory analyses, they are typically only used as spot checks of cleaning performance. This leaves open the possibility for contaminated parts escaping the quality control process, leading to expensive field failures. Moreover, since such tests have turnaround times of several days or longer, the laboratory analyses may not identify a problem until many parts have been improperly cleaned. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is an advantage of the present invention that a hydrocarbon detector is provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is another advantage of the present invention is that a hydrocarbon detector is provided that conveniently and cost effectively screens machined parts for hydrocarbon contamination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is another advantage of the present invention that a hydrocarbon detector is provided that can present real-time cleaning verification feedback in an industrial production line environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Yet another advantage of the present invention that a hydrocarbon detector is provided that is a handheld, self-contained unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The above and other advantages of the present invention are carried out in one form by a portable hydrocarbon detector for detecting a hydrocarbon presence on a surface. The detector includes a gas stream delivery element having a delivery element outlet configured to discharge a carrier gas onto the surface, the carrier gas serving to volatilize the hydrocarbon presence from the surface. The detector further includes a gas stream recovery element having a recovery element inlet configured to aspirate a sample gas formed from the carrier gas combined with the hydrocarbon presence volatilized from the surface. A hydrocarbon sensor, in fluid communication with the gas stream recovery element, detects the hydrocarbon presence in the sample gas and generates an output signal indicative of the hydrocarbon presence. An indicator is coupled to the hydrocarbon sensor for receiving the output signal and indicating the hydrocarbon presence in the sample gas.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a block diagram of a hydrocarbon detector <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Hydrocarbon detector <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is configured to detect a hydrocarbon presence <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> on a surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of a machined part. In a preferred embodiment, hydrocarbon detector <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is a hand-held device that may be readily utilized by a technician to screen some or all of a plurality of machined parts for the presence of residual hydrocarbon contamination remaining on surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> following a cleaning procedure that employs a hydrocarbon-based cleaning solvent. Thus, detector <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> provides rapid, qualitative verification of the efficacy of the cleaning procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Hydrocarbon detector <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes a gas stream delivery element <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and a gas stream recovery element <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Gas stream delivery element <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> includes a first tube segment <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> having an inlet end <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and an outlet end <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. A delivery element inlet <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is located at inlet end <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and a delivery element outlet <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is located at outlet end <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Gas stream recovery element <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> includes a second tube segment <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> having an inlet end <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and an outlet end <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. A recovery element inlet <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is located at inlet end <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and a recovery element outlet <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is located at outlet end <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Gas stream delivery element <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and gas stream recovery element <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are formed from a substantially hydrocarbon free material. A preferred hydrocarbon free material is copper tubing because it is inexpensive and malleable. However, other metals may be used. Alternatively, plastics that do not release hydrocarbons, such as polycarbonate, may be used to form gas stream delivery element <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and gas stream recovery element <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment, first tube segment <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is located inside of and axially aligned with second tube segment <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. In other words, first tube segment <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> has an outer diameter <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> that is smaller than an inner diameter <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of second tube segment <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. In addition, outlet end <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of first tube segment <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, having delivery element outlet <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, is located at a gas stream transfer side <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of detector <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Likewise, inlet end <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of second tube segment <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, having recovery element inlet <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, is located at gas stream transfer side <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of detector <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> A hydrocarbon sensor <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is in fluid communication with outlet end <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of gas stream recovery element <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Hydrocarbon sensor <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is configured to detect microgram levels of volatilized hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbon sensor <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> may be a solid state gas sensing device, a photo-ionization sensor, and the like that is capable of real-time detection of small quantities of contaminants to a high degree of precision, while at the same time being inexpensive and reliable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> A filter <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is positioned downstream from hydrocarbon sensor <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. In an exemplary embodiment, filter <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is an activated charcoal filter. However, zeolite (microporous silicate or aluminosilicate structured minerals) or other materials may also be employed as filter <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> An outlet <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of filter <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is in fluid communication with an inlet port <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of a recirculation pump <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, while an outlet port <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of recirculation pump <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is in fluid communication with inlet end <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of gas stream delivery element <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In operation, gas stream transfer side <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of hydrocarbon detector <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is held proximate surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. When detector <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is activated, recirculation pump <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> begins circulating a carrier gas, represented by arrows <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> through detector <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. More particularly, carrier gas <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is pumped from outlet port <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of recirculation pump <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. Carrier gas <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is subsequently pushed through first tube segment <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of gas stream delivery element <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and discharged from delivery element outlet <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> onto surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Carrier gas <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> serves to volatilize, or evaporate, hydrocarbon presence <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> from surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> To augment this volatilization, a heat source <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is coupled to gas stream delivery element <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. In a preferred embodiment, heat source <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is an electrical resistance device that wraps around and heats first tube segment <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Heat from first tube segment <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> subsequently heats carrier gas <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> traveling through gas stream delivery element <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Those skilled in the art will recognize that other heaters may be used, such as a Nichrome wire or coil, an infrared heater, a quartz heater, and the like for heating carrier gas <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> A temperature sensor <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is in communication with gas stream delivery element <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> at outlet end <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Temperature sensor <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> may be a bead thermistor, a thermocouple, and the like for detecting a temperature of carrier gas <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> discharged from delivery element outlet <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. A temperature controller <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is electrically connected to temperature sensor <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and heat source <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. Temperature controller <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> receives the temperature signal and controls heat source <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> in response to the received temperature signal. Temperature controller <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> varies the average electrical power applied to heat source <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> to maintain a constant temperature in heat source <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. Temperature controller <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> may also include an external control (not shown) that may be adjusted to decrease or increase the heat produced by heat source <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Heated carrier gas <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is discharged from delivery element outlet <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> onto surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The flow rate of carrier gas <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> onto surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> combined with the heat of carrier gas <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> effectively volatilizes hydrocarbon presence <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> from surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. A sample gas, represented by an arrow <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, is aspirated, or drawn, into recovery element inlet <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of gas stream recovery element <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> through suction caused by recirculation pump <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. Sample gas <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is formed from a combinations of carrier gas <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and hydrocarbon presence <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> volatilized from surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> A first flow rate of carrier gas <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> from delivery element outlet <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is greater than a second flow rate of sample gas <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> into recovery element inlet <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The differing flow rates occur due to a difference in cross-sectional area between first tube segment <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and second tube segment <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. For example, first tube segment <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may have an inner diameter that is one quarter the size of the inner diameter of second tube segment <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. A greater flow rate of carrier gas <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> from delivery element outlet <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> than the flow rate of sample gas <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> into recovery element inlet <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is desirable so that carrier gas <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> will thoroughly impinge surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> prior to being drawn into recovery element inlet <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> as sample gas <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In addition, the tube within a tube arrangement of first and second tube segments <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, respectively, effectively captures hydrocarbon presence <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> volatilized from surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for subsequent detection at hydrocarbon sensor <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. Although first tube segment <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of gas stream delivery element <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is positioned within second tube segment <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of gas stream recovery element <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, it should be understood that the opposite configuration will also result in the effective capture of hydrocarbon presence <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. That is, a tube segment of a gas stream delivery element may be larger than a tube segment of a gas stream recovery element so that the gas stream recovery element tube segment may be located inside of and axially aligned with the gas stream delivery element tube segment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Sample gas <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is drawn through second tube segment <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and exits recovery element outlet <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> where hydrocarbon sensor <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> detects hydrocarbon presence <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in sample gas <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. Hydrocarbon sensor <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> generates an output signal indicative of hydrocarbon presence <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. For example, hydrocarbon sensor <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> may generate a simple analog signal indicating a detectable presence of hydrocarbon in sample gas <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> An indicator <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is electrically coupled to hydrocarbon sensor <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. Indicator <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> receives the output signal from hydrocarbon sensor <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. In an exemplary embodiment, indicator <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is a light emitting diode (LED) that illuminates when the output signal exceeds a particular threshold. For example, indicator <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> may be a two-color LED. Thus, indicator <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> illuminates in a first color, i.e., green, when the output signal from hydrocarbon sensor <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is below the illumination threshold. Accordingly, indicator <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is illuminated green, in response to an absence of detectable hydrocarbon presence <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in sample gas <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. Similarly, when the output signal from hydrocarbon sensor <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is above the illumination threshold, indicator <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> illuminates in a second color, i.e., red, indicating hydrocarbon presence <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in sample gas <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. When hydrocarbon presence <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is substantially completely volatilized from surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and is no longer detectable by hydrocarbon sensor <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> in sample gas <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, indicator <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> illuminates in the first color, i.e., green, indicating the absence of hydrocarbon presence <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment, indicator <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> may be a single-color LED, and detector <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may include a second single-color LED. As such, detector <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be configured such that one of the LEDs illuminates in one color (i.e., red) when hydrocarbon presence <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is detected in sample gas <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, and the other LED illuminates in a different color (i.e., green) in the absence of hydrocarbon presence <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Although indicator <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is described in terms of a light emitting diodes, it should be understood that other indicators, such as audible tones, LCD displays, analog meters, and so forth may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Sample gas <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is subsequently filtered downstream from hydrocarbon sensor <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> by filter <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to remove hydrocarbon presence <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and other contaminants from sample gas <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. Sample gas <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> from filter <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is then returned to gas stream delivery element <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> as carrier gas <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> absent hydrocarbon presence <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> All of the components of hydrocarbon detector <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, discussed above, including a battery power source are packaged in a common hand-held housing, represented by dashed lines <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. Housing <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is desirably shaped for ready grip by the user. For example, housing <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> may be barrel-shaped, like that of a flashlight. Alternatively, housing <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> may include a hand grip, like that of a handgun. Detector <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may include a pushbutton or trigger switch for activating detector <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The portable structure of hydrocarbon detector <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, battery operation, and indicator <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> allows a technician to obtain a qualitative indication of hydrocarbon presence <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> on some or all of a plurality of machined parts and equipment. Hydrocarbon detector <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be used to present real-time cleaning verification feedback in an industrial production line environment or in the field. This cleaning verification feedback can be used to optimize the quantity of cleaning solvent that is used in an equipment cleaning process so that waste of the solvent due to overcleaning and recleaning due to undercleaning is minimized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a block diagram of a hydrocarbon detector <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> in accordance with an alternative embodiment of the present invention. Hydrocarbon detector <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is a dual pump system (discussed below) that permits a user to change the flow rate of sample gas <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> independent from carrier gas <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In summary, the present invention teaches of a hydrocarbon detector that is a handheld, self-contained unit. The hydrocarbon detector presents real-time qualitative detection of hydrocarbon contamination on machined parts and equipment. Through the use of the hydrocarbon detector, cleaning verification feedback can be conveniently and cost effectively obtained in an industrial production line environment as well as in the field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Although the preferred embodiments of the invention have been illustrated and described in detail, it will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications may be made therein without departing from the spirit of the invention or from the scope of the appended claims. For example, the present invention is not limited to the detection of hydrocarbon contamination. For example, the hydrocarbon sensor may be replaced by another sensor that can detect different volatile contaminants, such as heavy grease, silicone oils, and so forth. In addition, the heat produced by heat source can be adjusted to more effectively volatilize these other volatile contaminants. </paragraph>
