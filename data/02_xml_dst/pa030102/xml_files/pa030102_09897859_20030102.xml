<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">An implantable cardioverter/defibrillator includes an active can electrode and a high-voltage lead that can be electrically isolated from one another by opening a switch between them. The performance of the high-voltage lead and the can electrode can then be independently monitored, thus indicating which lead is inoperable, should one become inoperable. If a lead becomes inoperable, the implantable device can then reconfigure an electrical pathway such as a cardioversion and/or a defibrillation pathway by excluding the inoperable lead. By separating the high-voltage lead from the can electrode, pseudo ECG measurements can also be taken and utilized by the implantable device. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to implantable arrhythmia control devices and more specifically to implantable pacemakers, cardioverters and/or defibrillators. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Cardioversion generally refers to the discharge of relatively high energy electrical shocks into or across cardiac tissue to arrest a tachyarrhythmia of a cardiac chamber. The termination of high rate tachycardias with lesser energy electrical pulses or bursts has also been referred to as cardioversion. The arrest of atrial or ventricular fibrillation by higher energy shocks is referred to as defibrillation, and defibrillation has been characterized in the past as a form of cardioversion. Implantable cardioverter/defibrillator (ICD) systems are available for providing synchronous cardioversion shocks and/or asynchronous defibrillation shocks. Additionally, pacemaker/cardioverter/defibrillator (PCD) systems are available for providing additional staged therapies of anti-tachyarrhythmia pacing, synchronous cardioversion shocks and asynchronous defibrillation shocks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> ICD&apos;s or PCD&apos;s will typically include a housing assembly containing a microprocessor or control unit and a power supply. One or more leads are coupled to the housing assembly and positioned within or adjacent to a portion of the heart. The leads may include electrodes to deliver directed discharge of electrical current. The housing assembly itself can be formed from a conductive material and may serve as an electrode. When so utilized, the housing assembly is often referred to as an &ldquo;active can&rdquo; or can electrode. For example, an electrode may be positioned in the right ventricle (RV). A high voltage shock may then be directed from the can electrode to the RV electrode across a major portion of cardiac tissue. Of course, electrodes can be placed in any chamber of the heart and the defibrillating or cardioverting shock can be managed and administered as appropriate between various electrodes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The variety of lead/electrode configurations available on ICD&apos;s or PCD allow for a wide range of treatment options directed specifically to a patient&apos;s particular cardiac condition. This variety also requires that certain common assemblies be implemented for use in varying contexts and programmabilities to accommodate specific configurations. In addition, it is desirable to determine the operative and functional status of the various components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Certain implantable medical devices have previously performed some self diagnostic procedures. For example, commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 5,755,742 discloses a system that indirectly measures the impedance of certain leads coupled to an implantable pacemaker/cardioverter/defibrillator. A low voltage or sub-threshold pulse is generated across a given pair of leads. Another pair of leads then monitors that pulse and derives the impedance from the measured values. One lead is common to both the generating lead pair and the measuring lead pair. The derived impedances are used to assess and evaluate the integrity of the lead being tested. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In general, the invention relates to an implantable PCD or ICD having a housing assembly that can be selectively set to an active can status. In addition, the PCD or ICD of the invention includes at least a first lead coupled to a high-voltage electrode, typically positionable in the superior vena cava (SVC). Also provided is second electrode which is typically an RV electrode positionable within the right ventricle of the heart and coupled with an RV lead. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> An implantable PCD may include control circuitry coupled to the various leads and electrodes. Conventionally, when an SVC electrode and an active can electrode are provided on the same device, they are electrically connected together. Thus, the control circuitry cannot distinguish between the can electrode and the SVC electrode. The present invention enables the SVC electrode to be monitored and utilized independently of the can electrode, providing several features and improved device performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments, the SVC electrode may not be implanted with the PCD or ICD. Instead, the SVC electrode may be implanted at a later time, and electrically coupled to an implanted PCD or ICD. The controller may be configured to monitor whether or not the SVC lead and electrode are electrically coupled to the PCD or ICD. When it is not detected, the controller disables the various functions that require the SVC electrode. Once the SVC electrode is detected, the controller enables those functions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Once detected, the controller monitors the SVC lead and electrode, as well as other leads coupled to the PCD or ICD, to verify that they are operating within certain predetermined parameters. In particular, the controller may generate a low voltage or subthreshold pulse at predetermined time intervals, and monitors the impedance through the various leads. If the impedance falls within a predetermined range of values, the controller determines that the lead is operable. If not, the lead may be classified as problematic and an appropriate action may be taken. One such action would be to generate an alarm or alert that would indicate to the patient that a problem exists. Another action would be to reconfigure the defibrillation and/or cardioversion pathways. For example, a good but previously unused electrode may be utilized instead of the &ldquo;malfunctioning&rdquo; or inoperable lead. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In order to initially determine if the SVC lead is present and to monitor its performance after it is so detected, the SVC lead should be electrically separable from the can electrode. The present invention generally discloses a switch between the can electrode and the SVC electrode so as to selectively electrically decouple them. The switch is preferably operable by the controller and selectively opens and closes the connection between the can electrode and the SVC electrode. When the switch is opened, the impedance of the can electrode and the SVC electrode can be independently measured and monitored. In the alternative, if the switch is closed, the can electrode and the SVC electrode would be electrically coupled to one another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> When the switch is open, measurements of electrical cardiac activity between the can electrode and the SVC electrode can result in a pseudo ECG. The ECG is a &ldquo;pseudo&rdquo; ECG in the sense that it is measured internally, via the implantable medical device rather than externally through a conventional reading of ECGs. The ECG provides additional data to the implantable device, allowing it to monitor and react to specific cardiac occurrences. The ECG provides more information than the EGM, which reading is typically available to an implantable device. For example, the implantable medical device can trigger off various portions of the cardiac cycle, rather than just the limited portion often available through an EGM. However, in order for an implantable device to record and monitor a pseudo ECG, the SVC electrode should be present and operable. Thus, in one embodiment, the present invention detects the presence and condition of the SVC electrode and enables the pseudo ECG function only when the functional integrity of the SVC electrode is confirmed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the invention provides an implantable medical device comprising a controller and pulse generator configured to deliver cardioversion pulses, a housing coupled with and containing the controller and pulse generator and acting as a can electrode, an SVC lead coupled with the controller and pulse generator and the housing, and a switch coupled between the SVC lead and the can electrode wherein the switch is controllable by the controller and electrically isolates the SVC lead from the can electrode when in an open position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the invention provides a method comprising providing a can electrode, a SVC lead electrically separable from the can electrode and a second lead electrically separated from the can electrode and the SVC lead, generating a pulse, and measuring the impedance between the can electrode and the SVC lead, between the can electrode and the second lead, and between the SVC lead and the second lead. The method further involves determining if the measured impedances are within a predetermined range, and classifying each of the can electrode, the SVC lead, and the second lead as operable or inoperable based on the determination of the measured impedances. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In yet another embodiment, the invention provides an implantable medical device for cardioversion and/or defibrillation, the implantable medical device comprising a can electrode, a SVC lead, and means for determining the operability of the SVC lead. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the invention provides a method of utilizing an implantable medical device, the method comprising detecting the presence of an SVC lead that is electrically separable from a can electrode, setting the SVC lead to present once it is detected, measuring the impedance of the SVC lead, and determining if the SVC lead is operable based on the measured impedance. </paragraph>

Other features, objects, and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Depending upon the programmed pacing mode, pacing pulses may be applied to the atrium and/or ventricle in response to the detection of the appropriate bradycardia condition by the IMD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The pacing and sensing functions may be effected through atrial and ventricular bipolar pace/sense electrode pairs at the ends of right atrial/superior vena cava (RA/SVC) and right ventricular (RV) leads <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, respectively. Leads <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be fixed in the right atrium <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and right ventricle <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, respectively, that are electrically coupled to the circuitry of IMD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through a connector block <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> A coronary sinus (CS) lead <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> includes an elongated insulating lead body enclosing one elongated coiled wire conductor coupled to an elongated exposed coil wire CS cardioversion electrode <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. CS cardioversion electrode <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, illustrated in broken outline, is located within the coronary sinus of the heart <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. At the proximal end of CS lead <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is a connector end <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> having an exposed connector coupled to the coiled wire conductor and attached within the connector block <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to connector block terminals in a manner well known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The RA/SVC lead <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may include an elongated insulating lead body carrying concentric, electrically isolated, coiled wire conductors separated from one another by tubular insulating sheaths. The lead body may be in an atrial J-shape in order to position its distal end in the right atrial appendage. An atrial pace/sense ring electrode <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and an extendable helical, pace/sense electrode <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, mounted retractably within an insulating electrode head <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, are formed distally to the bend of the J-shape. Helical electrode <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is extendable out of the electrode head <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and can be screwed into the atrial appendage in a manner well known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> RA pace/sense electrodes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are employed for atrial pacing and for near-field sensing of P-waves. An elongated, exposed coil, RA/SVC cardioversion electrode <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is supported on RA lead <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> extending proximally to pace/sense ring electrode <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and coupled to the third coiled wire conductor within the RA lead body. RA/SVC cardioversion electrode <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> preferably is 10 cm in length or greater and is configured to extend from within the SVC and toward the tricuspid valve <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. At the proximal end of the RA lead <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is a bifurcated connector <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> which carries three exposed electrical connectors, each coupled to one of the coiled wire conductors, that are attached within the connector block <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to connector block terminals in a manner well known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The delivery of atrial cardioversion/defibrillation therapies to the atria may be effected through selected combinations of intracardiac electrodes, e.g. the illustrated exemplary RA/SVC cardioversion electrode <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and the CS cardioversion electrode <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The exposed surface <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the outer housing or can of the IMD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be selectively used as a can electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Can electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may serve as a subcutaneous remote cardioversion electrode in combination with one or more intracardiac cardioversion electrodes for cardioverting or defibrillating the atria. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The RV lead <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may include an elongated insulating lead body, enclosing at least three concentric, electrically isolated, coiled wire conductors, separated from one another by tubular insulating sheaths. Located adjacent the distal end of the RV lead <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are a pace/sense ring electrode <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, and a helical, pace/sense electrode <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, mounted retractably within an insulating electrode head <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Helical electrode <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is extendable out of the electrode head <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and can be screwed into the ventricular apex in a manner well known in the art. RV pace/sense electrodes <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are each coupled to a coiled wire conductor within the RV lead body and are employed for cardiac pacing in the ventricle and for sensing near-field R-waves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In embodiments of the present invention, implemented to delivering ventricular cardioversion therapies, a distal segment of RV lead <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> also supports an elongated, exposed wire coil, cardioversion electrode <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Cardioversion electrode <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may be placed in the right ventricle <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of heart <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and connected to a further coiled wire conductor within the RV lead body. Although not specifically illustrated, it will be understood that the ventricular cardioversion therapies may be delivered between further RV cardioversion electrodes in combination with cardioversion electrode <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> or between the cardioversion electrode and the can electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and/or the CS cardioversion electrode <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> or the RA/SVC cardioversion electrode <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. At the proximal end of the RV lead <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is a bifurcated connector end <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> having a plurality of electrical connectors, each coupled to one of the coiled conductors in the RV lead body, that are attached within the connector block <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to connector block. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a schematic illustration of IMD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Can electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is illustrated with respect to SVC lead <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and RV lead <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Other leads may also be utilized, but are not illustrated. Typically, SVC lead <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> will be electrically connected to can electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, thus rendering them electrically indistinguishable from one another. Switch <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is provided to selectively electrically isolate can electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> from SVC lead <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> For various reasons, it may be desirable to verify the performance of the various leads coupled to IMD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. To do so, pacer timing and control circuit <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> initiates a low voltage or &ldquo;sub-threshold&rdquo; discharge. The impedance across each pair of leads is then measured and compared with a predetermined standard. For example, it may be assumed that an operable lead should have an impedance of between about 20 &OHgr; (ohms) to 200 &OHgr;. If an impedance value outside of this range is measured, the lead may be classified as inoperable. The separate measurement of the impedance of can electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and SVC lead <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is possible because can electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is electrically separable from SVC lead <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a functional schematic diagram of the circuitry of IMD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in which the present invention may usefully be practiced. IMD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be in the form of comprehensive dual chamber, implantable pacemaker/cardioverter/defibrillator (PCD). Certain of the pace/sense and cardioversion/defibrillation functions may be disabled or not provided to configure the PCD device to operate in other dual chamber or single chamber PCD operating modes. Therefore, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> should be taken as exemplary of the circuitry of the type of IMD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in which the invention may be embodied, and not as limiting, as it is believed that the invention may usefully be practiced in a wide variety of device implementations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The circuitry of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> includes a high voltage section for providing relatively high voltage cardioversion/defibrillation shocks when needed in response to detection of a tachyarrhythmia, a low voltage pace/sense section for sensing P-waves and/or R-waves and providing relatively low voltage bradycardia pacing and anti-tachycardia pacing therapies, both operated under the control of a microcomputer including a microprocessor <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>, ROM/RAM <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> and DMA <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>. Other functions, including uplink and downlink telemetry with an external programmer for interrogating or programming operating modes and parameters, are also provided in a manner well known in the art. </paragraph>

Assuming the electrode configuration of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the correspondence to the illustrated leads and electrodes is as follows: can electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be hard wired or programmably substituted for the defibrillation electrode terminal <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>. Terminal <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> is adapted to be coupled through RV lead <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to RV COIL electrode <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>.

Although not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, it will be understood that high voltage protection power FETs are incorporated within switch matrix and protection circuit <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> between the atrial and ventricular pace/sense terminals, <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> and the APACE and VPACE output circuits <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, respectively, to protect against IC damage from cardioversion/defibrillation shock energy induced across the electrodes of the pace/sense leads when such shocks are delivered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In the event that generation of a cardioversion or defibrillation shock is required, microprocessor <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> employs the an escape interval counter to control timing of such cardioversion and defibrillation shocks, as well as associated refractory periods. In response to the detection of atrial or ventricular fibrillation or tachyarrhythmia requiring a cardioversion shock, microprocessor <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> activates cardioversion/defibrillation control circuitry <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, which initiates charging of the high voltage capacitors <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight> via charging circuit <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>, under control of high voltage charging control line <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. The voltage on the high voltage capacitors <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>249</bold></highlight> is monitored via VCAP line <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight>, which is passed through multiplexer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. In response to reaching a predetermined value set by microprocessor <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>, the voltage on VCAP line <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> results in generation of a logic signal on Cap Full (CF) line <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight>, terminating charging. Thereafter, timing of the delivery of the defibrillation or cardioversion shock is controlled by PTC circuitry <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. Following delivery of the shock therapy, the microprocessor <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> may then return the operating mode to cardiac pacing and awaits the next successive interrupt due to pacing or the occurrence of a sensed atrial or ventricular depolarization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated operating system, delivery of the cardioversion or defibrillation shocks is accomplished by output circuit <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>, under control of control circuitry <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> via control bus <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight>. Output circuit <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> determines whether a monophasic or biphasic shock is delivered, the polarity of the electrodes and which electrodes are involved in delivery of the shock. Output circuit <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> also includes high voltage switches which control whether electrodes are coupled together during delivery of the shock. Alternatively, electrodes intended to be coupled together during the shock may simply be permanently coupled to one another, either exterior to or interior of the device housing, and polarity may similarly be preset, as in current implantable defibrillators. An example of output circuitry for delivery of biphasic shock regimens to multiple electrode systems may be found in U.S. Pat. No. 4,727,877, incorporated by reference in its entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Turning to the lead integrity test operations of the present invention, a lead impedance measurement logical interface (LIMLI) <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> is provided and employed in a test mode initiated by commands from the microprocessor <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> on address/data bus <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> either automatically on a periodic basis or in response to a programmed-in command received through telemetry. Very generally, when the lead impedance test mode is initiated by microprocessor <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>, a &ldquo;force&rdquo; terminal pair and a &ldquo;measure&rdquo; terminal pair having only the lead under test in common are selected from among defibrillation terminals <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and pace/sense terminals <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> (through connections made in switch matrix and protection circuit <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and output circuit <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> as described below). In the following description, the term &ldquo;lead&rdquo; comprises a single electrode and lead conductor having a proximal connector element for connection to one of these terminals, even though it may be part of a bipolar or tripolar pacing or cardioversion/defibrillation lead as described above, and includes the can electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and associated electrical connections between it an terminal <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>. The &ldquo;lead impedance&rdquo; as further defined below includes the intrinsic lead resistive impedance that may be measured between the distal electrode and the proximal connector element when the lead is not implanted. This intrinsic lead impedance is a relatively low value for a lead without any insulation defects or loose or open internal connections with the proximal connector element and the distal electrode. The lead impedance that is actually measured when the lead is implanted includes the electrode/tissue interface impedance (ETI), and also includes any impedance caused by a loose or otherwise poor electrical connection of the proximal lead connector element with the IPG connector block connector element. The ETI impedance may be considered a resistive impedance, for purposes of the lead integrity test and varies depending on electrode surface area/shape and associated current density. The total normal lead impedance value ranges for any particular lead design and combinations of excitation and measure lead pairs may be derived empirically from clinical experience gained over time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> A sub-threshold, excitation or &ldquo;force&rdquo;, lead impedance voltage pulse (LIPULSE or V.sub.p) of predetermined amplitude and pulse width is generated by a force pulse generator within LIMLI <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>. The sub-threshold pulse is set at a value that has insufficient energy to capture the heart. The force pulse V.sub.p is applied to the terminal of the force terminal pair not coupled to the lead under test (the &ldquo;driven terminal&rdquo;) while the terminal of the lead under test is held at system ground. The excitation path therefore is through the driven terminal, the lead not under test, the patient&apos;s body and/or heart tissue, the lead under test, and system ground. A measure path is also selected which includes a measure terminal different from the driven terminal, the lead coupled thereto, the patient&apos;s body and/or heart tissue, the lead under test and its terminal at system ground. It should be noted that the force pulse V.sub.p could be in the form of a current pulse instead of a voltage pulse, and, in either case, may consist of one or more phases of differing polarity. For simplicity, the force pulse V.sub.p is assumed to be a constant voltage pulse. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The electrical current delivered to the excitation path during the delivery of the force pulse V.sub.p is measured as a signal I.sub.m in the LIMLI <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>. At the same time, the voltage appearing across the measure terminal pair is measured as the signal V.sub.m in LIMLI <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>. The measure and force terminal pairs have the lead under test in common, and no current flows through the lead coupled to the measure terminal. From the measured current I.sub.m flowing into the excitation path and the measured voltage V.sub.m induced across the measure path between the measure terminal pair, it is possible to calculate the apparent impedance of the lead under test and infer the state of lead integrity by comparison to maximum and minimum impedance threshold values. If the calculated impedance is within the acceptable impedance range, the lead under test may be assumed to not have a lead integrity failure. However, since the excitation path and the measure path include the two other leads, a further diagnosis of the lead impedances obtained after concluding lead integrity tests of all of the involved leads may be necessary to determine which lead exhibits a lead integrity failure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Very generally, in one approach illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the measured current I.sub.m and voltage V.sub.m are employed to derive a lead impedance in microprocessor <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> that is then employed by the microprocessor <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> in a diagnostic comparison to normal impedance values in order to diagnose tentative lead integrity failures. The impedance thresholds for the particular leads under test are derived in advance from characteristics of the lead type or model under test and stored in RAM/ROM <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> for use by the microcomputer <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>. When a lead impedance failure is tentatively diagnosed from the comparison, a patient warning is invoked in patient perceptible warning device <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> to alert the patient to contact the attending medical personnel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Whether or not a lead integrity failure is diagnosed by microcomputer <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>, the impedance data may also be stored in RAM in ROM/RAM <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> until telemetry out is initiated. The impedance data may be collected on a regular schedule and be stored with related data for later telemetry out. The stored data may be compressed, for example as weekly high and low impedance values, and retained for extended periods of time. When telemetered to the external programmer, they may be displayed by the external programmer and interpreted by the physician with assistance of a programmer-resident lead impedance thresholds and an analysis program to display lead impedance trends and diagnose potential faulty lead insulation or lead conductor fractures involving all the potential lead integrity failure combinations of a unipolar, bipolar or tripolar lead. Alternatively, LIMLI <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> may apply a test pulse directly to the lead under test and in a similar fashion, measure the impedance values. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates the results of impedance measurements made across a given pair of leads when a given electrode is inoperable. For example, if can electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is inoperable, impedance measurements from SVC <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to can electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and from can electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to RV lead <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> will both be out of range. At the same time, however, impedance measurements from SVC lead <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to RV electrode <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be within the predetermined range. Similarly, if RV lead <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is inoperable, measurements from SVC lead <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to RV lead <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and can electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to RV lead <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> will be out of range. Measurements across SVC lead <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and can electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be within the predefined range. If SVC lead <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is inoperable or problematic, impedance measurements across SVC lead <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and can electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and measurements across SVC lead <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and RV lead <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> will be out of range. Measuring the impedance across can electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and RV lead <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> will provide an in range reading. Thus, it is possible to measure impedance across these three leads and determine if they are functioning properly. Of course, additional leads could also be measured in a similar fashion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> While the foregoing discussion relates to a sub-threshold lead impedance test, it will be understood that any other type of impedance measurement known in the art may be used within the context of the current invention. For example, any type of mono-phasic or bi-phasic type pulse could be applied as the test signal. An alternating current (AC) signal could be applied to derive an AC impedance measurement, for instance. In another embodiment, impedance may be measured by delivering a low-energy defibrillation pulse between two of the electrodes, although this method is not preferred as it will result in some patient discomfort. Thus, the specific impedance mechanism described in detail above should be considered exemplary only. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> If a given lead is determined to be inoperable, control logic <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> can reconfigure the defibrillation and cardioversion pathways. For example, if SVC lead <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is determined to be inoperable, control logic <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> may exclude it and include can electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in its place. In this manner, the patient will continue to be able to receive therapy, despite a detected malfunction in one of the leads. In addition to reconfiguring the pathways, an alarm or indication may be provided to alert the patient, a physician, or an attendant to the condition. When examined by a cardiologist or other medical caregiver, data stored within a memory of IMD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can indicate the failure of a given lead and can also provide the history of that lead over a given period of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> IMD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can measure the intrinsic electrical activity of heart <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by measuring across any given pair of sensing leads, e.g., sense leads <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. However, the data obtained is limited to only a portion of the cardiac electrical cycle and is referred to as an EGM (electrogram). The present invention, by electrically separating can electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> from SVC lead <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, allows a pseudo ECG (electrocardiogram) to be taken. This provides more complete data about the cardiac electrical cycle and allows for more precise delivery of pacing or cardioversion pulses. That is, IMD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can monitor P waves, T waves, and the QRS complex rather than just a portion of that data normally detectable with an EGM. Thus, therapy can be timed and delivered synchronously with various portions of the cardiac cycle. Additionally, this data can be recorded over time and output for review by a cardiologist. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a flowchart illustrating a process of detecting and utilizing SVC lead <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. As explained above, SVC lead <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may not always be implanted with IMD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Thus, IMD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> should monitor for SVC lead <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and only enable various functions that make use of the SVC lead once it is properly detected. At a periodic interval such as once per day, IMD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will attempt to measure the impedance of SVC lead <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, as illustrated in step <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. Assuming it is not present, the impedance value will always be extremely high and out of range. It will therefore be assumed that the lead is not present in the system, as shown by step <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Once SVC lead <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has been connected (either with the initial implantation or subsequently), the impedance measurement will result in an impedance reading that is within the predetermined range. Once so detected, the SVC lead <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is indicated as being &ldquo;present&rdquo; within the system, as depicted in step <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, IMD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will always assume the presence of SVC lead <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> until or unless it is externally reset. Also, once the SVC lead is found to be present, IMD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will enable the pseudo ECG functions that are dependent upon SVC lead <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> being present. This is illustrated in step <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. Subsequently, control circuit <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> can open switch <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and measure between SVC lead <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and can electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, thus obtaining pseudo ECG data that may then be used appropriately. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Once SVC lead <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is found to be present, the impedance of that SVC lead <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the other leads will be periodically measured to determine if they are operable, as indicated in step <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. Of course, this test could have been done on the other leads prior to initially detecting SVC lead <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. This test is performed by measuring across each pair of leads while a sub-threshold pulse is generated. In order to electrically distinguish can electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> from SVC lead <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, switch <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> should be opened. The data is recorded in step <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> so that a performance history for each measured lead can be developed. If the impedance measurements are all within the acceptable range in decisional step <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, the leads are determined to be operable and the measurement is repeated again in step <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> at the predetermined interval. For example, the test may be performed daily with little perceptible drain on battery performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> If one or more of the measurements is out of range, IMD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will determine in step <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> which lead/electrode is inoperative. If appropriate, a warning may be generated in step <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> to alert the patient that a problem exists. Such a warning may be in the form of an audible tone or other appropriate warning indicia. If the inoperable lead is can electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> or SVC electrode <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the pseudo ECG function may then be disabled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Once it has been determined that one or more leads is inoperative in step <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, control logic <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> may reconfigure the defibrillation and/or cardioversion pathways. That is, the inoperative lead will no longer be relied on. The remaining operative leads will be selectively utilized as appropriate. The energy output for a give pulse can likewise be modified so as to provide the optimum charge for the pathway selected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> While the current invention is described in terms of an SVC coil that may be selectively switched in common with the IMD can, many other types of electrodes may be provided in place of the SVC coil to provide all of the capabilities and advantages described herein. For example, an electrode positioned within the coronary sinus such as CS cardioversion electrode <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> may be substituted for the SVC coil within the context of the current invention. Alternatively, a subcutaneous patch electrode may be utilized for this purpose. In another embodiment, the RV electrode could be selectively coupled to the can such that a defibrillation shock is delivered between the can/RV electrode and the SVC electrode. Any other types of high-voltage electrode positioned in another area of the body could be substituted for the SVC coil electrode, if desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> According to yet another aspect of the invention, multiple high-voltage electrodes may be provided on a single lead, with the device having the capability to selectively couple one or more such electrodes in common with the can. </paragraph>

Either or both of these conductors may be selectively coupled to the can electrode <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>. In this manner, a high-voltage shock may be delivered using one or more of the electrodes of lead <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and/or the can electrode <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>. Any combination of these electrodes may be utilized based on impedance measurements made in a manner similar to that discussed above. The use of a particular electrode configuration can further be selected based on measured DFT thresholds, on the unique anatomy of a given patient, and on other patient-specific considerations that may be determined by a physician and retained for later use within a storage device of the IMD. </paragraph>
