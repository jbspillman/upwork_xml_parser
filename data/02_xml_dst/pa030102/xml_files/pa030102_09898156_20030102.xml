<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> This invention is an audio and mechanical vibration transducer adapted to receive audio signals without requiring dedicated wiring, that is by making use of a Radio Frequency (RF) over-the-air or Power Line Carrier (PLC) communication channel. For the purposes of this patent disclosure either of these communication channels is defined as &ldquo;wireless.&rdquo; By adapting wireless communications to an audio/mechanical vibration transducer, this invention facilitates the use of the transducer that can be placed at some distance from the audio transmitter, which typically requires an AC power connection, by not requiring additional or dedicated wiring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> An audio/mechanical vibration transducer is a device that is used to present the &ldquo;feel&rdquo; of sound to a user. As the audio signals from an audio source, such as but not necessarily limited to a stereo, a compact disk player, a television, a home entertainment system, a theater system, are transmitted, the transducer converts the received signals into mechanical vibrations that can be felt by the user. The transducer can be placed under a cushion or pillow of a couch, chair or bed. The system of this invention can be used in conjunction with both any standard stereo system as well as multi-channel audio systems. In its preferred embodiment this invention has very low frequency response as is appropriate for transducer activation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> This invention is also able to convert the received audio signals to drive, activate or control such visual displays as lights, moving pictures and dynamic designs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> As noted above, this invention uses PLC or over-the-air RF technology to provide a communication channel for the mechanical and visual transducers in order to permit the placement of the transducers at a distance from the audio signal source without requiring additional or dedicated wiring between the source and the transducers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a block diagram of the preferred transducer communication system of this invention. The audio signals are provided by an audio signal transmitter <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> that is either coupled to the AC power line or to an RF antenna (either of which for the purposes of this patent disclosure are referred to as &ldquo;wireless transmitter&rdquo;) for transmission <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> to the transducers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The transducers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>receive the audio signals from the wireless transmitter <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and convert these signals to either mechanical vibration signals for one or more mechanical vibrators <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>or visual signal drivers <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. As can be seen from this drawing, a variety of different visual signal drivers are supported by this invention, including but not necessarily limited to visual lights <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, visual pictures <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, and visual images <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. For the purposes of this disclosure the term &ldquo;actuator&rdquo; shall be interpreted to include one or more of the mechanical vibrators, visual signal drivers and audio speakers. Multiple transducers can be connected to a single transducer and a combination of mechanical transducers only, visual transducers only or mechanical and visual transducers are supported. Since both the mechanical and visual transducers generally use low frequencies, they are provided with an input filter to limit the band of frequencies permitted and to minimize signal noise. The wireless transmitter <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is also compatible with use with wireless speakers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, which also typically uses an RF over-the-air or power line communication channel <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The previously described preferred embodiment of this invention is to be considered in all respects only as illustrative and not as restrictive. Although the embodiment shown here describes specific components and subsections of the preferred embodiment, the invention is not limited thereto. The scope of this invention is indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description. All devices and systems, which come directly within the claims or within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims, are to be embraced as being within the scope of this patent. </paragraph>
