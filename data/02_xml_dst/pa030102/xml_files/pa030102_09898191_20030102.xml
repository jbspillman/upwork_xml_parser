<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A tunable vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) is formed by providing a gap in its laser cavity that can be adjusted to vary the gap distance therein to change the resonance of the cavity and the wavelength of photons that are generated. A pump laser provides a pump source of photons that are coupled into the laser cavity of the vertical cavity surface emitting laser. The vertical cavity surface emitting laser is coupled to a piezo-electric submount to form the gap in the laser cavity. The gap distance is adjusted to tune the vertical cavity surface emitting laser around its center wavelength by applying a voltage (i.e., an electric field) across the piezo-electric submount which causes mechanical stress therein. Alternate embodiments are disclosed including a joined unit of elements to form the tunable vertical cavity surface emitting laser as well as a system of elements to form the tunable vertical cavity surface emitting laser. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates generally to semiconductor lasers. More particularly, the invention relates to tuning the wavelength of output photons in optically pumped semiconductor lasers. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Semiconductor lasers have become more important. One of the most important applications of semiconductor lasers is in communication systems where fiber optic communication media is employed. With growth in electronic communication, communication speed has become more important in order to increase data bandwidth in electronic communication systems. Improved semiconductor lasers can play a vital roll in increasing data bandwidth in communication systems using fiber optic communication media such as local area networks (LANs), metropolitan area networks (MANs) and wide area networks (WANs). A preferred component for optical interconnection of electronic components and systems via optical fibers is a semiconductor laser known as a vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL). The current state of design and operation of VCSELs is well known. Due to optical properties of optical fibers, photons emitted at longer wavelengths from a laser tend to propagate longer distances due to lower loss and smaller dispersion. Thus, forming a VCSEL that can operate at longer wavelengths, such as a wavelength greater than 1.25 &mgr;m, is desirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Lasers can be excited or pumped in a number of ways. Typically, VCSELs have been electrically excited (electrically pumped) by a power supply in order to stimulate photon emission. However, achieving photon emission at long wavelengths using electrical pumping has not been commercially successful due to a number of disadvantages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> More recently it has been shown that a VCSEL can be optically excited (optically pumped) to stimulate photon emission. Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, it has been shown that an in-plane laser <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can have its emitted photons <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>A redirected by a mirror <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> into the direction of photons <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>B for coupling into a VCSEL <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The in-plane laser <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is designed to be electrically excited in order to emit photons <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>A at relatively short wavelengths (850 nanometers (nm) to 980 nanometers (nm)). The redirected photons <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>B from the in-plane laser <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> optically excite the VCSEL <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The VCSEL <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is designed to be optically excited in order to emit photons <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> at relatively long wavelengths (1250 nm to 1800 nm). A disadvantage to the system of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is that the wavelength for the photons emitted by the VCSEL <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> are not tunable. Typically, the long wavelength of the output photons is designed to a predetermined value by the materials selected in forming the VCSEL <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Wavelength tunable lasers are important for dense wavelength division multiplexed (DWDM) applications where a semiconductor laser wavelength has to comply with an International Telecommunications Union (ITU) wavelength grid. Using a distributed feedback (DFB) laser formed to generate photons near the wavelength of interest, a conventional method to fine-tune the wavelength of the laser is to control the laser operation temperature. In order to generate wavelengths of photons over the whole range of the ITU wavelength grid, many DFB lasers formed to generate different wavelengths can be used and multiplexed together. However, due to the large number of lasers involved, the system complexity is rather high and stocking the entire range of lasers for replacement is bothersome. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Another means to tune the wavelength of a DFB laser is to use sampled grating technology. One problem associated with using sampled grating technology is that device yields can be low due to the grating complexity. Additionally, the control electronics for tuning the wavelength of a DFB laser using sampled grating technology can be complicated. Additionally, the coupling efficiency of the photons generated by DFB lasers into a single mode fiber is typically low due to a spatial mismatch between the DFB&apos;s output laser beam and the fiber core of a single mode optical fiber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Because long wavelength VCSELs can have a circular beam profile, the coupling efficiency into an optical fiber can be superior to a DFB laser. Thus if the wavelength of photons output by a long wavelength VCSEL can be tuned, greater advantages can be achieved over that of a tunable DFB laser. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> One way that a long wavelength VCSEL may be tunable is through the application of Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) film technology. MEMS film technology involves forming an MEMS film directly onto the VCSEL. One drawback to using MEMS technology is that MEMS film is rather fragile and may be destroyed. Additionally, MEMS film is sensitive to mechanical vibrations and vibrations induced by noise. Furthermore, yields of devices incorporating MEMS technology are typically low. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It is desirable to overcome the limitations of the prior art. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In the following detailed description of the invention, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. However as one skilled in the art will recognize, the invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances well known methods, procedures, components, and circuits have not been described in detail so as not to unnecessarily obscure aspects of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The tunability in the invention is provided by varying a gap distance D of a gap within a resonant cavity of an optically pumped vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL). The gap in one embodiment is an air gap (i.e., a free space gap) but can just as well be filled with certain materials, such as polymer materials. By varying the resonant cavity of the laser, the wavelength of output photons can be tuned around a center wavelength for which the laser was designed similar to tuning to a carrier frequency of a communications channel from an oscillating frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In first and second embodiments, a submount is provided to which a portion of the optically pumped vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) and an electrically pumped semiconductor laser are coupled and separated. A second distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) for the laser cavity of the optically pumped vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) is coupled to the electrically pumped semiconductor laser forming an air gap there between. The electrically pumped semiconductor laser and the optically pumped VCSEL are aligned such that the laser output of the electrically pumped semiconductor laser can stimulate emissions by the optically pumped laser. The gap distance of the air gap in the cavity of the optically pumped VCSEL is varied to vary the wavelength generated by the long wavelength VCSEL. The submount is formed out of a piezo-electric material such that when a voltage is applied across it, the crystals are aligned so that the length of the piezo-electric material varies. Variances in the length of the piezo-electric material accordingly varies the distance of the air gap and the wavelength of the photons generated by the optically pumped VCSEL. The submount may be a lever-arm or cantilever type system or a lifting type system to generate the variance in the gap. One or more openings are provided in the submount system so that photons can pass through undisturbed by it. In one embodiment, a folded cavity surface emitting laser (FCSEL) is the electrically pumped semiconductor laser that is used to generate the pump source of photons. Typically, the wavelength of photons of the pump source is 850 nanometers or 980 nanometers to generate a relatively long wavelength from 1250 to 1700 nanometers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In third and fourth embodiments, the pump source of photons from a laser is provided to the optically pumped VCSEL through an optical fiber. A submount to which the optical fiber and the optically pumped VCSEL are coupled provides separation between a coating at the end of the optical fiber and the material layers of the optically pumped VCSEL generating an air gap in a resonant cavity of the long wavelength VCSEL. The submount is a piezo-electric subassembly, including a piezo-electric material, such that when a voltage is applied, its length varies as does the gap distance of the air gap and the wavelength of the photons generated by the optically pumped VCSEL. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A, a</cross-reference> side view of a tunable long wavelength semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is illustrated. The tunable long wavelength semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> includes an optically pumped vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, a piezo-electric subassembly <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, an air gap <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, and an electrically pumped semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> coupled together as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B. The air gap <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> forms part of a resonant cavity for the optically pumped vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the air gap <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is a free space air gap but in alternate embodiments, the air gap <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> can be filed with certain materials, such as polymer materials. The distance of separation in the air gap <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is referred to as the gap distance D. The gap distance D may also be referred to as a separation distance or gap separation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The gap distance D may be altered by changing the voltage applied to the piezo-electric subassembly. A change in the gap distance D changes the resonance of the laser cavity of the long wavelength optically pumped VCSEL <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and therefore changes the wavelength of the photons that are generated by it. Depending upon how the lasers are mounted, increasing the voltage to the piezo-electric subassembly <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> increases the gap distance D in the air gap <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> in one embodiment to increase the wavelength of the photons generated by the optically pumped VCSEL <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. In another embodiment, increasing the voltage applied across the piezo-electric subassembly <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> decreases the gap distance D in the air gap <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> to decrease the wavelength of the photons generated by the optically pumped VCSEL <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The electrically pumped semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> (also referred to as an &ldquo;electrically pumped short wavelength semiconductor laser&rdquo; or &ldquo;pump laser&rdquo;) is designed to operate at relatively short wavelengths (from 770 nanometers (nm) to 1480 nanometers (nm)) and the optically pumped VCSEL <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> (also referred to as an &ldquo;optically pumped long wavelength VCSEL) is designed to operate at relatively long wavelengths (from 1250 nm to 1700 nm). In one embodiment, the electrically pumped semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> operates at 850 nm while the optically pumped VCSEL <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is designed to operate at 1310 nm or 1550 nm with wavelength tuning range provided by the invention at around 100 nm or less. In another embodiment, the electrically pumped semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> operates at 980 nm while the optically pumped VCSEL <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is designed to operate at 1310 nm or 1550 nm with wavelength-tuning range provided by the invention at around 100 nm or less. In yet another embodiment, the electrically pumped semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> operates at 1480 nm while the optically pumped VCSEL <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is designed to operate at 1550 nm with wavelength tuning range provided by the invention at around 100 nm or less. The range of wavelength tuning provided around the center wavelength is plus or minus fifty nanometers (&plus;/&minus;50 nm) in one embodiment. The range of wavelength tuning can be more or less depending upon the design of the frame for the piezo-electric subassembly <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and the available voltage that can be applied across it. The long wavelength optically pumped VCSEL <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> operates by being optically pumped by the short wavelength semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> which is electrically pumped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The electrically pumped semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> can be a number of types capable of providing a gap between it and the optically pumped VCSEL <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. The electrically pumped semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> is a folded cavity surface emitting laser (FCSEL). FCSELs were previously described in greater detail in the related U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/430,570 which has been incorporated herein by reference. Alternatively, the electrically pumped semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> can be a horizontal cavity surface emitting laser or a vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL). In exemplary embodiments, the electrically pumped semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is a multimode semiconductor laser designed to operate at 850 nm or 980 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The long wavelength optically pumped VCSEL <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> has its resonance cavity spread across the air gap <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. The long wavelength optically pumped VCSEL <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> includes a substrate <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, a first distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) mirror <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> and an active area or region <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> coupled together as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> on one side of the air gap <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. The elements of the long wavelength optically pumped VCSEL <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> can be monolithically grown together or deposited layer on top of layer starting from the substrate layer <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> depending upon the type of materials utilized. The active region <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> is grown or bonded onto the first DBR mirror <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. A second DBR mirror <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, to complete the resonant cavity of the long wavelength optically pumped VCSEL <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, is grown or deposited onto the short wavelength pump laser <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> on the opposite side of the air gap <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. This makes the air gap <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> a part of the resonant cavity of the long wavelength optically pumped VCSEL <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. Thus, variances in the gap distance D of the air gap <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> alters the resonant cavity of the long wavelength optically pumped VCSEL <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The first DBR <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> coupled to the active region <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> can be a Gallium-Arsenide/Aluminum-Gallium-Arsenide (GaAs/AlGaAs) DBR, an Indium-Phosphide/Indium-Gallium-Arsenide-Phosphide (InP/InGaAsP) DBR, or a dielectric DBR and formed of pairs of material layers accordingly. The active region <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> can be InGaAsN, InGaAsP or an Indium-Aluminum-Gallium-Arsenide (InAlGaAs) quantum well structure having one or more quantum wells. The substrate <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> of the long wavelength VCSEL <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> can be a GaAs or an InP substrate. The second DBR <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> coupled to the short wavelength pump laser <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> can be a GaAs/AlGaAs DBR, a InGaAsP/InP DBR, or a dielectric DBR and formed of pairs of material layers accordingly. DBRs <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> are made of thicknesses to provide substantial (preferably 99% or more) reflection of long wavelengths around 1.3 um or 1.55 um to amplify and stimulate emission. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The pump laser <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> in the embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> is a folding cavity surface emitting laser (FCSEL) <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> which includes an n-type doped GaAs substrate <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>, a distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, an active area or region <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>, and a cladding layer <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> with an oxide ridge. The substrate <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> is one embodiment is GaAs. The layers of the DBR <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> may be formed from n-type Al<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>Ga<highlight><subscript>1-x</subscript></highlight>As/Al<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>Ga<highlight><subscript>1-y</subscript></highlight>As pairs of material with x ranging from 0 and 0.5, and y ranging from 0.5 and 1, and have between five to twenty five pairs.

<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Although the short wavelength semiconductor laser, also referred to as the pump laser, can be multimode either longitudinally or transversely, the output from the long wavelength VCSEL is single mode longitudinally. The output from the long wavelength VCSEL can be single mode transversely depending upon the geometric integration scheme and patterning. In coupling with a single mode optical fiber, it is preferred that the long wavelength VCSEL operate in a single transverse mode to optimally couple thereto. Modulation of the long wavelength VCSEL <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> can be achieved through either direct electrical modulation of the short wavelength pump laser <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> or through external modulation using an external modulator, such as an EL modulator. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In operation, the short wavelength semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is electrically pumped to generate photons of a relatively short wavelength for coupling into the long wavelength VCSEL <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> through the air gap <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. When electrically stimulated, the folded cavity surface emitting laser <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> generates a short wavelength laser beam which is reflected between the beam steering element <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight>, beam steering element <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>, DBR <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight>, and the top surface of cladding <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>. An in-plane laser beam is reflected by beam steering element <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> into a substantially perpendicular beam for coupling into the long wavelength VCSEL <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> to optically pump it. The photons generated by the pump laser <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> stimulate the long wavelength VCSEL <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> to generate photons of a relatively long wavelength. After becoming sufficiently pumped to reach lasing threshold, the long wavelength VCSEL <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> emits the long wavelength laser beam <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>.
