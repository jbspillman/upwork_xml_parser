<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> This invention is a method and system for the synchronization of the digital transmission of analog modem signals. Analog modems require a fixed amount of delay time for modem-to-modem communication. If the modem signal is sampled and digitized, using an analog to digital converter (ADC), and then recreated through a digital to analog converter (DAC), the delay from the time when the original signal was sampled to when the signal was recreated must be kept constant for optimal communication. If the delay is not held constant V90 modems will reduce the data transfer rate, thereby lowering communication efficiency. Keeping the delay constant is fairly straightforward if the same clock is available to both the ADC and the DAC. However, when the communication signal is transmitted by use of Radio Frequency (RF) or Power Line Carrier (PLC) the drift of the sample clock and the recreation clock will cause a variation in the communication system delay. Again, in order to maintain high data rates the sample clock and the recreation clock have to be synchronized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The synchronization should be maintained between the two communicating modems in both directions. Therefore, the transmission from a base unit (the first modem) to an extension unit (the second modem) should maintain constant delay and the transmission from an extension unit (the second modem) to a base unit (the first modem) should maintain constant delay. While the initial delay will vary due to the range, or communication distance, of the modem-to-modem channel, during the operation of the modem, the delay should not vary or the modem speed will be degraded. Maintaining this communication delay constant is a key in maintaining high modem speeds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The fundamental concept behind this invention is that the ADC samples the signal and initiates the transfer when the receiver receives the data. The DAC then recreates the signal a fixed time later. Since the recreation clock is determined, in this invention, by the sample clock the two (the ADC and the DAC) will have been synchronized and a fixed delay will have been established. If the communication system is a full-duplex system the recovered recreation clock can be used as the sample clock and the sampled data transmitted back. Since the two sample clocks and the two recreation clocks of this invention depend on each other, a fixed clock delay is maintained in both directions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> One preferred technique for synchronizing the sample and recreation clocks is to generate the recreation clock from the received start bit of an asynchronous data transmission. The start bit is detected and the recreation clock is generated. The data word following the start bit is serially received from the transmission medium and is sent serially to the DAC or is stored and sent a specified number of cycles later. While the data is being sent to the DAC, data can be read in from the ADC and transmitted via the return path for a full duplex communication system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows the block diagram of the preferred embodiment of this invention. The base unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is shown in wireless communication <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> with an extension unit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. The preferred wireless communication channel <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is either RF over the air or PLC over standard AC power lines. The signal <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> from a modem, typically from a central office, is received by the Line Interface Circuitry <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of the base unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The output <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> of the Line Interface Circuitry <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is provided to an Analog-to-Digital (A/D) Converter <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> which converts the received output <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> of the Line Interface Circuitry <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> from an analog signal to a digital signal. The produced digital signal <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is then provided to the Timing/Framing Circuit <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The Timing/Framing Circuit <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> sets up the timing <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> for the communication system, by framing the data to be transmitted and sending a start bit, or other similar synchronizing bit that is tied to the framing of the data to be sent to the extension unit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. This timing information <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is also is also sent to the Digital-to-Analog (D/A) Converter <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> in the base unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> for synchronizing of the incoming data from the extension unit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> or the return path. The timing pulse or start bit along with the digital data <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> that is framed for transmission is fed to the A/C Power Line Carrier (PLC) transceiver or, alternatively, RF transceiver <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and is sent to the extension unit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> A/C PLC or RF transceiver <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, where the received digital signal <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> is provided to the Synchronizer <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. The Synchronizer <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> uses the start bit or synchronizing pulse to time align the framed data in order to establish the constant delay required for high modem speeds. This aligned digital frame of data <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is sent to the D/A Converter <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, where the digital frame is converted back to an analog formatted data signal <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The analog formatted data signal <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is provided to the extension unit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> Line Interface Circuitry <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>, which in turn provides the desired signal <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> to the user&apos;s modem <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The return path starts with the user&apos;s modem <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>, passes through the extension unit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> Line Interface Circuitry <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> outputting an analog data signal <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The Analog data signal <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is provided to the extension unit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> A/D converter <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> producing a digital data signal <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. The A/D converter <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> is time aligned by the Synchronizer <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> and the digital data signal <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> is formatted by the Formatting Circuit <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> and is transmitted to the base unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> using either RF or AC PLC transceivers <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> of the extension unit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. The transmitted signal <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is received by the base unit RF or AC PLC transceivers <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. The received digital data <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> is formatted by the base unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> Formatter <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, which generates a formatted digital signal <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> for the D/A Converter <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>.
