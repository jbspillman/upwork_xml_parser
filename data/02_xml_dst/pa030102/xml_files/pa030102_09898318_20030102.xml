<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A multi-charged particle beam tool for semiconductor wafer inspection or lithography includes an array of electron beam columns, each having its own electron or ion source. The objective lenses of the various electron beam columns, while each has its own pole piece, share a common single magnetic coil which generates a uniform magnetic field surrounding the entire array of electron beam columns. This advantageously improves the spacing between the beams while providing the superior optical properties of a strong magnetic objective lens. When used as an inspection tool, each column also has its own associated detector to detect secondary and back-scattered electrons from the wafer under inspection. In one version the gun lenses similarly have individual pole pieces for each column and share a common magnetic coil. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to multiple charged particle beams, for use in inspection or lithography. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> It is well known to inspect semiconductor devices, for instance, those fabricated on semiconductor wafers, using a scanning electron beam inspection tool. Advantageously such electron beam inspection is not constrained by the optical (light) diffraction limits encountered by optical inspection techniques. Therefore electron beam inspection is considered useful for next generation (critical dimension less than 0.25 microns) inspection for semiconductor manufacturing. Currently commercially available electron beam-based inspection machines use a single electron beam column, based on the principle of scanning electron microscopy. The single electron beam is raster scanned over the areas of interest on a fabricated semiconductor wafer. Secondary and back-scattered electrons generated by the incident beam are detected and registered pixel-by-pixel using conventional image processing techniques to reconstruct an image of the inspected region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Low throughput is a significant obstacle in such machines, because the images are acquired as described above pixel-by-pixel in a sequential manner. Low throughput significantly raises inspection costs and hence is undesirable. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In accordance with this invention, an apparatus and associated method are provided for electron (or other charged particle) multiple beams for inspection or lithography of microstructures such as features formed on a semiconductor wafer. Applications include high-speed imaging, charged particle lithography and defect inspection of micro-fabricated structures including defect inspection of integrated circuit die on semiconductor wafers, masks or reticles for microfabrication, flat panel displays, and micro-electro-mechanical (MEMs) devices during and after manufacture. In particular, one embodiment is directed to high-speed defect inspection with a cost-effective and scalable multi-beam approach. The inspected features include, for instance, gates, contacts, vias, interconnects, and other semiconductor or micro-machined structures, including diffused regions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The apparatus (tool) includes array of charged particle beam columns, each directing its beam onto the workpiece (e.g., semiconductor wafer). Each beam column includes its own electron source (emitter) or ion source; a gun lens downstream of the source to focus the charged particles into the beam; a suitable beam aperture and an associated isolation valve to preserve the vacuum; column alignment and astigmatism correction compensation elements; a secondary (back-scattered) electron or particle detector and an objective lens. (It is to be understood that generally here the terms optics, lens, etc., apply to charged particle optics, rather than to light optics.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The array of beam columns, a 3&times;3 or 5&times;5 beam array for instance, also includes a single objective lens coil, which is an electro-magnetic coil surrounding the individual objective lens pole pieces of all the beam columns in the array. This arrangement provides superior (lower cost and greater stability) optical properties and high electron beam density. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> One limitation of the throughput of a prior art single column system for inspection is the individual detector/data path performance, which typically, in terms of data flow, is less than 100 Mhz per second. The present multibeam (multicolumn) system, in contrast, does not have this limitation because the required bandwidth for each detector is reduced by the number of columns. The distribution of the column array across a region under inspection (or being imaged for lithography) of the workpiece makes it possible to implement a stage with travel a fraction of the size of the workpiece. This reduces the footprint of the associated vacuum chamber to &frac12; to &frac13; of the size required in the prior art, e.g., a typical chamber holding a 300 mm wafer stage is 1.5 to 2 meters long but a typical 200 mm wafer stage chamber is about 50% smaller. The smaller 200 mm stage can be used with the column array to inspect or fabricate a 300 mm wafer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Also included, in one embodiment, are &ldquo;null&rdquo; (dummy) beam columns surrounding the column array. That is, the perimeter portions of the array contain beam columns that may omit certain elements (for instance, electron emitter and detectors) but do contain other elements (for instance, the magnetic objective lens pole pieces, the magnetic gun lens pole pieces, and magnetic deflection elements) as do the active columns. The null columns are included to improve the optical properties of the active columns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> An associated method uses multiple beam columns each with its own detector for micro-structure inspection. This can be done using a step-and-scan scheme for inspection or continuously moving the stage supporting the workpiece under inspection. If one of the beam columns fails, the system control system registers this failure. The area intended to be inspected by the failed beam column can be inspected using one of the other (active) columns or be inspected using a conventional single column system that is designed to inspect a small portion of a wafer.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In accordance with this invention, inspection or lithography tools and associated methods use an array of charged particle (e.g., electron) beam columns. In semiconductor lithography (patterning) there are well known multi-electron beam column technologies. However, these are specifically intended for electron beam lithography which does not require superior imaging capability of backscattered or secondary particles. Examples of these lithography techniques include the micro-column approach proposed by Etec Systems, Inc.; micro-column thin film transistor flat panel display lithography techniques; multiple electron beam columns proposed by Etec Systems, Inc.; and the multi-beamlet approach developed by International Business Machines. These all have significant shortcomings either in terms of the electron source, the detectors, the voltage contrast, the space occupied, potential wafer damage or complexity. They especially have such shortcomings in the inspection context. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Low energy electron microscopy technology based on electron beam projection imaging requires the workpiece be immersed in a strong electrostatic field. This is not suitable for inspection of semiconductor wafers, where the wafers cannot be exposed to the associated harmful high voltages. Other potential problems with this approach are the requisite small physical sample size and the small field of view. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In contrast, the present tools and associated methods use an array of electron beam columns, each having a single beam, each beam having a current in the range of, for instance, 10 to 100 nanoamps with resolution in the range of a few nanometers to 0.1 micron. This tool is capable of inspecting at a rate of tens of gigapixels per second as compared to only 10 to 100 megapixels per second using current commercially available electron beam single column inspection systems. Hence the present tool provides 10 to 100 times greater throughput than do current single beam column inspection tools, for instance, the Odyssey 300 inspection tool supplied by Schlumberger Technologies of San Jose, Calif. A tool as disclosed herein with suitable modifications is also suitable for lithography. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> A typical energy of each electron beam in the present tool is approximately a few tens of eV. A typical diameter of each beam is 0.1 &mgr;m. In one embodiment, the number and arrangement of electron beam columns in the array is, for instance, 2&times;2, 3&times;3, 4&times;4 or 5&times;5; other arrangements are possible and the array need not be square (n&times;n). A typical spacing of the electron beams is a few to tens of mm center-to-center. In order to inspect a particular semiconductor wafer region, the workpiece (e.g., wafer) under inspection is translated in a plane normal to the beams either in a continuous movement or in step-and-scan movement using a conventional stage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> One embodiment of the present tool is depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> in a side cross-sectional view. It is to be understood that in this and the other figures some of the conventional structures of the type generally present in electron or ion beam equipment are not shown, including the vacuum containment chamber, vacuum tubing and pumps, stage interferometer, stage controller, electrical interconnections, various mounting and spacing structures, control electronics, host computer, card cage, control computer, image processing computers, data base computers, and the computer network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> tool is assembled from conventional electron beam column components, that is, the column electromagnetic optical components are fabricated by a conventional precision machine shop. Alternatively, a micro-machined version is possible. Dimensions and/or numerical values provided herein are illustrative and not limiting. The exact size, of course, is generally not critical for the components; the size of the components, the electrical currents and power, the electron beam current, brightness and energy are determined by the particular inspection or lithography application, as is understood by those knowledgeable in the charged particle beam field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, relevant portions of the tool as depicted in a simplified side cross sectional view include a 5&times;5 array of electron beam columns. Since this is a side view, only five of the columns (those in the same row) are shown. Only three columns <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>(the active columns) produce electron beams while columns <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are &ldquo;dummy&rdquo; columns (null columns) for improving the electron optical properties of the three active columns. The differences between active columns and null columns are explained below. The number of active columns may be expanded to, e.g., 4&times;4, 5&times;5, and the number of null columns may be more than one row on each side of the array to surround the active columns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> depicts detail for each active column, e.g., column <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>Each column <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>includes an electron emitter <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, which is part of an electron gun (which also includes a single common gun lens coil <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>), gun octapole <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, beam current limiting aperture <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, isolation valve <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, alignment coils and astigmatism correction coils assembly <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, secondary particle detector <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, and an objective lens <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The detector <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> if present when the tool is used for lithography is then located near the wafer <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The gun lens includes in this embodiment a single magnetic coil <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> which surrounds all of the columns in the array, including columns <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>The gun lens co<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>il <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> has associated concentric pole pieces, e.g., <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in each column. Similarly the objective lens is a second magnetic coil <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> surrounding the lower portions of all the columns. These single coil lenses have been found to result in better optics and resolution. In this embodiment both the gun lens and objective lens are magnetic type rather than electrostatic. Although magnetic lenses in general have a better resolution, it is possible alternatively to use electrostatic lenses. The objective lens pole pieces may be a micro-fabricated structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> As shown, in the lower portion of each column, for instance, column <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, there are a number of other essentially conventional structures. These include the prescan coil <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> followed by the solenoid <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> which collimates the secondary (backscatter) electrons. Immediately downstream of the solenoid <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is the scan coil <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> followed by the pole pieces <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>Below that is located the charge control plate <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. The wafer (or other workpiece) is shown in this side view as dark line <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and is supported on a conventional stage <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> immediately below wafer <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. One suitable stage is disclosed in copending application Ser. No. 09/318,400, filed May 25, 1999, entitled &ldquo;Stage for Charged Particle Microscopy System&rdquo;, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> All of the column structures in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> are shown in cross section and are rotationally symmetric about the electron beam axis for each column. The two lens coils <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are also cylindrical structures surrounding all of the columns. Each active column <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c, </italic></highlight>is identical. The outer null columns <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>have most of the structures of the active columns but omit, for instance, the electron emitter and the detector as not being needed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The conventional electron emitter <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is, for instance, a thermal field emitter (TFE) or Schottky emitter of the type commercially available, for instance, from FEI or Danka Co. Other suitable emitters are lanthanum hexabromide (LaB<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>) thermal field emitters or cold field emitters. It is preferred to use an emitter having high brightness and high stability, e.g., of the TFE or Schottky type. A TFE/Schottky type emitter typically requires a negative 300 V suppressor voltage to suppress electron emission from the emitter shank. The emitter cup is the illustrated structure surrounding the emitter. The suppressor cups each electrically float, relative to the beam voltage, at a second common voltage and are driven by a single power supply (not shown). Each emitter has a conventional associated extraction field high voltage supply control and also filament heating control. A common power supply is used to drive all the electron emitters in the array of columns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Each emitter <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is typically resistively heated to 1700-1900 degree Kelvin and electrically floats at a negative beam potential. Each emitter has its own current source supply for the filament heating. An independent extraction electrode is located downstream of each emitter, typically 0.3-0.6 mm away from the emitter surface. The extraction electrode floats at a positive potential (voltage) relative to the emitter potential in order to extract electrons from the emitter. Because each emitter has a slight variation in tip radius and extractor distance, the extraction potential may vary between each emitter. Therefore, each extraction electrode is driven by an individual power supply. The extraction voltage is adjusted such that each electron gun emits electrons at essentially the same brightness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The conventional ultra high vacuum environment for TFE emitters and accurate alignment between the emitter and the associated gun lens center are also provided. As is well known, a TFE-type emitter typically requires a surrounding vacuum better than about 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;8 </superscript></highlight>torr to achieve bright, long lifetime stable emission. This emitter vacuum is maintained by a conventional vacuum enclosure surrounding the columns and stage and associated ion pumps (not shown). Because the columns share a common vacuum enclosure, vent holes (as described below) are provided to connect the columns so that they can be commonly pumped by one or more ion pumps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In the depicted embodiment the gun lens is a single common coil <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> with individual column pole pieces <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>A strong magnetic lens using a pole piece is known for its superior electron optical properties, compared to an electrostatic lens when used to focus relatively low energy electron beams, as in this tool. However, most prior art multi-beam systems (as used in lithography) adopt electrostatic lenses because a strong magnetic lens occupies a larger footprint and thereby imposes a restriction on the number of beams. A single coil <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> array magnetic objective lens with individual column pole pieces <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> resolves this footprint problem because here only a single circumferential coil <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is used for the entire array of columns. The single coil <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, shown in cross-section in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, is located at the periphery surrounding the array of electron beam columns. This allows more electron beam columns to be packed into a smaller footprint. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the gun lenses are of electrostatic type, such as the common tetrad lens used in the commercially available Schlumberger Technologies IDS series 10000 electron prober or that of the type used in commercially available FEI scanning electron microscopes. Each lens in this embodiment includes an extractor electrode, a lens electrode, and an anode electrode. Varying the lens electrode voltage focuses or defocuses the beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> It has been found that, with the single coil objective or gun lenses as described here, those electron beam columns at the periphery of the array have poorer optics than those in the center due to the asymmetric arrangement. This problem is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> where a side view of a 3&times;3 column array is shown including active columns <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f, </italic></highlight>which are otherwise identical to columns <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>.

<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The problem is further seen by comparing the beam <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>electron trajectories in a peripheral column <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>(<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>) and that in the center column <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>(<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference>). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference> depicts an exemplary electron beam <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>located in a peripheral column in the array.

The deviation shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference> is undesirable. Note that the horizontal scale in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A, 3B</cross-reference> is reduced relative to that of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> so that the deflection of the beam in the peripheral column of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference> is apparent. This problem is solved by including null columns <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in the column array as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>

Thus FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>D show the advantage of use of the null columns. It is apparent from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</cross-reference> that the deflection problem of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference> does not exist in the peripheral active columns <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>when the null columns <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates the effect of the unintended deflection field which causes the undesired trajectories deviation shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a plot with the horizontal axis being the distance from the electron gun emitter tip (left side of figure) <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the surface of wafer <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> (right side of figure) for a column. The vertical axis shows the additional deflection fields transversed to the beam axis (expressed in Gauss, the standard unit of magnetic measurement). The broken line is the plot for an active column without the null column being adjacent, that is, for a peripheral column in the array where the peripheral column is an active column, whereas the solid line is for the case of an active column with an adjacent null column, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>. As can be seen there is undersirably significantly greater deflection in the absence of the null column. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> To minimize aberrations introduced by misalignment, it is important to accurately align the emitter elements <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to the center of extractor holes <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>and to the centers of the respective gun lens pole pieces <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>This is accomplished by precisely machining the parts, typically to a few tens of microns. The structure laterally surrounding pole pieces <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is of non-magnetic material, e.g., aluminum.

A similar socket is provided for emitter <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The associated electrical connectors <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are coupled to flexible connectors <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> to take into account any misalignment between the feed-through structures <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the associated electrical connectors <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>In addition, miniature dual electrical octapoles can be used to electrically steer the beam to the optical axis of each column. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Built-in emitter heaters <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>raise the vacuum temperatures to greater than 100&deg; C. during vacuum bring up. A thermocouple <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight> measures the emitter temperature and thereby control the emitter heating. It is known that water vapor from the chamber walls prevents the vacuum from improving beyond 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;7 </superscript></highlight>and 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;8 </superscript></highlight>torr. Elevating the chamber temperature helps to drive off water condensation on the chamber walls so that water can be pumped out quickly. The heating elements are typically resistive electrical heater coils attached to the vacuum chamber body with a good thermal conduction contact. The emitter heating is turned off after the vacuum is pumped down to the operation pressure and, therefore, no magnetic field disturbance is introduced to the electron beams during column operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Immediate downstream of the electron gun (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) is the respective octapole (or a pair of octapoles) <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> which functions as a beam deflector and provide astigmatism correction, aperture <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and isolation valve <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The aperture <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> conventionally defines the diameter of the associated electron beam and is a passage through a plate otherwise opaque to the beam. In one embodiment, there are several apertures of different sizes associated with each beam column. When the beam current and/or resolution need to be adjusted to optimize to a particular inspection requirement, a different size aperture is selected by moving (orthogonally to the beam axis) the plate in which the apertures are defined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, an integrated aperture <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and isolation valve <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is used as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A, 6B</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>C. All of the beam columns in the array share a common aperture plate <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> and hence the aperture sizes are changed in all columns simultaneously by translating plate <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> laterally. As an example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference> shows two apertures <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> of different size. Fine movement of plate <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> selects either the large aperture (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference>) or the small aperture (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</cross-reference>) as the aperture for the beam <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d. </italic></highlight>The number of different apertures can be greater than two; only two are shown. One issue related to the common aperture plate <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> is that it is not possible to finely adjust the aperture plate to simultaneously align each column beam to optimize the optics. The electrostatic gun octapole <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) can be independently adjusted for each column to serve this purpose. There is no need for a gun octapole in the null columns because the null columns do not have a beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Also associated with this portion of each beam column is the isolation valve <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, which isolates the vacuum in the upper part of each beam column, including the emitter <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, from the downstream portions of the beam column. Valve <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is used, for instance, during emitter replacement or servicing (cleaning) of the downstream portions of the beam columns. In one embodiment, isolation valve <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is as depicted in cross section <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A, 6B</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>C. By moving all the apertures outside the O-rings <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</cross-reference>), no passage will exist between the emitter chamber and the rest of the column. The apertures are pumped via vent <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> by a pumping system which differs from the pumping system associated with the emitter chamber. The reason that the aperture vacuum needs to be pumped during closing of the isolation valve <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is so that the vacuum in the emitter chamber will not degrade when the valve <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is reopened again. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, located next downstream in each beam column are the conventional optics <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> for objective lens alignment and astigmatism correction. These functions are accomplished by either an electrostatic or magnetic octapole(s). Next downstream in each beam column is detector <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> concentric to beam tube <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. Again, the null columns <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>contain no detector since they have no electron beam. In this embodiment, each column has its own independent detector <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> arranged to detect secondary and back-scattering electrons from the workpiece <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. Typically detector <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is a conventional disc-shaped detector defining a central passage concentric to the associated electron beam and beam tube <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. Examples of suitable detectors are a microchannel plate, a micro-sphere plate, semiconductor detectors (PIN or avalanche diode), and scintillation type detectors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> depicts a single exemplary column <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, but expanded for purposes of better depiction in the horizontal direction and showing the secondary electron paths <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. Similar structures are labeled as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. This embodiment also includes a conventional Wien filter <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. The Wien filter <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is a well known device used in charged particle beam systems which generates electrostatic and electromagnetic fields to deflect the secondary electrons <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> into the detector <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> with no effect on the primary electron beam (not shown here). The Wien filter <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> consists of a pair of electrostatic plates and a perpendicularly arranged pair of magnetic coils. Also shown in this depiction is a liner tube <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, not illustrated in the earlier figures, for conducting the electron beam through the objective lens part of the column <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>There is also the beam tube <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, which is electrically insulated from the detector <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and passes through the detector <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> center hole. Tube <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> can be electrically biased to repel the secondary electrons <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. By balancing the electrostatic field and the magnetic field, secondary particles (electrons) <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, not the primary beam electrons, are deflected by the Wien filter <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> fields. Because the secondary particles <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> are deflected from the primary beam axis, the detector <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> does not have to be the concentric disc type if the Wien filter is present. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Except for the Wien filter <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> and the associated detectors, the remainder of the column structures shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> are common to the embodiments employing either concentric detectors or those with a Wien filter <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. Solenoid coil <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> collimates secondary particles traveling from the workpiece <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> through the lens <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. When concentric detectors are used, the solenoid coil <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> can be energized to disperse the secondary electrons <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> so that the number of secondary electrons <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> traveling back up through tube <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is minimized. Those secondary particles passing through the tube <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, will not be detected by the detector <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and therefore, reduce detection efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The liner tube <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> has its lower end electrically connected to the charge control plate <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. The liner tube <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, similar to that used in the Schlumberger IDS 10000 series electron beam prober, is mounted inside the objective lens yoke as shown. The liner tube <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> is made of non-magnetic, insulator material such as ceramic. Its inner wall is coated with a conductive thin film that it has a typical resistance value in tens of kilo-ohms. A voltage relative to the charge control plate <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is also applied to the upper end of the liner tube <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. A relative positive voltage on that upper end assists in collimating secondary particles. On the other hand, a relative negative voltage can be used as an energy filter selecting secondary particles <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, charging control to reflects secondary particles back to the wafer <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, and for preventing secondary particles <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> from reaching the detector <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> during pre-charging. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The objective lens also plays a role in secondary electron <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> detection. The magnetic field in each column objective lens (excited by the single coil <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) funnels the secondary particles <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> from the work piece <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> through the objective lens so as to avoid the need for a high extraction electric field on the surface of the work piece <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> One detector <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> embodiment uses semiconductor PIN or avalanche diode type detectors because compactness makes them ideal for a two dimensional array configuration, and their fast rise and fall time (in the sub-10 nanosecond range) makes them ideal for high throughput inspection purpose. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> depicts using such detectors for a 3&times;3 active column array, shown in a simplified plan view. Each column <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>. . . , <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>i </italic></highlight>in the array employs at least one detector <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> (not shown). Each detector is typically reversed biased at tens of volts. Each detector floats at a positive potential to attract the secondary particles and to achieve high electron multiplication at impact. Therefore electrical isolation is provided to bring the detector signal to ground in order to couple the signals to an associated conventional frame grabber for data analysis and image construction. Each detector is connected to a local pre-amplifier, e.g., <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>i. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The amplified signals from e.g., preamplifier <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>are transmitted through individual high voltage cables such as <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>(a transmission line) to a electrical to an optical signal converter <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>(residing in enclosure <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight>) that floats at an elevated voltage, typically in the range of 5 to 20 KV. The detector and the local pre-amplifier <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>also float at the same high voltage because of the connection to the converter <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>where the detector signal is converted into an analog optical signal.

The magnetic field strength is on order of several hundred to several thousand Gauss.

The two coil sets <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are positioned surrounding ends of the liner tube <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. To optimize beam size and field of view size, coil positions, the field strength ratio generated between the two coil sets <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> (that is, the relative field strength), and the angle between the two field vectors generated by the two coil sets <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> (relative angle) needs to be determined for each column. This can be done using a simulation software package supplied by MEBS, Ltd, England. In one embodiment a movable axis or a shifting axis scheme for the beam is accomplished by using the two coil sets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The theory for such a movable lens and a shift axis lens is found in numerous publication. See, e.g., <highlight><italic>Optik </italic></highlight>vol. 48 (1977) pages 255-270 &ldquo;MOL (Moving Objective Lens)&rdquo; by E. Goto et al, incorporated herein by reference. A brief description of the principle is as follows: When a beam travels through the lens optical center, the beam trajectory is not affected by the presence of the lens field. On the other hand, when the beam travels off the optical center, it experiences a transverse field pulling toward the axis. The concept of a movable or shift axis lens is to use the first set of scan coils to deflect the beam off the lens center. A second set of scan coils in the close vicinity of the lens focusing field is used to generate an opposite filed to cancel or minimize the lens transverse field. This requires the field vector generated by the second set of scan coils to be adjusted electronically. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, by shifting the lens axis per field of view, each column can electronically step (translate) and acquire multiple frames of images during inspection before the need for stage movement. In another embodiment, the lens axis is adjusted pixel-by-pixel while acquiring a wide field of view, high resolution images. This approach is used for a continuous moving stage scheme, as discussed below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> It is expected that each column will require a slightly different objective lens excitation to focus the portion of the workpiece in the field of view. This is due to small mechanical variations, cathode variation, and workpiece height variations between columns. Because there is only one objective lens focusing coil <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, each column is additionally provided with its own associated subsidiary focusing coil <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) that has a much weaker focus strength than does coil <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, to compensate for the focus variation column-to-column. Each coil <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is individually energized for individual column focussing. Electrostatic subsidiary focusing is an alternative, for instance using octapoles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows an adjustment and focusing method useful with the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> apparatus. This is essentially a conventional process, typically carried out manually or under control of a computer program. Each act is as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. This process is carried out periodically, for instance, once a day or perhaps once a week. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The above-described tool can be used in various inspection or lithography (electron beam patterning of resist) applications. Movement of the workpiece relative to the electron beam column array is accomplished, e.g., by step-and-scan or by continuous movement. Typically this is accomplished by movement of the stage <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) supporting the wafer <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> as is conventional. In one embodiment the stage <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> is an x-y stage, e.g., similar to that used in Schlumberger Odyssey 300 inspection tool or as referred to above in the copending patent application. The stage <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> is capable of translating a 300 mm wafer in both the x and y directions. An upper stage (not shown) is driven by a set of piezo-electric motors, which in turn are carried by a linear motor traveling in a perpendicular direction. This arrangement eliminates stage interference (electromagnetic radiation, magnetic structure distorting objective lens field, etc) to the column optics while maintaining a reasonable footprint. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the column locations are spread out so that the required stage travel is significantly reduced. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</cross-reference> a 3&times;3 active column array (as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>) is depicted in simplified plan view to show this stage travel reduction. The center-to-center distance between the left columns <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>and right columns <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>i, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>is C. Because the left side of the wafer <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> (which has a diameter of W) can be inspected by the left column array <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>whereas the right end of the wafer <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> can be inspected by the right column array <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>i, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>(see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>B)), the stage <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> (not shown but carrying wafer <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>) only needs to travel in the horizontal direction by a distance (W-C) to allow inspection of the entire wafer <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. Similarly, the stage <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> needs to travel only distance (W-C) in the vertical direction. This results in substantial reduction in the system footprint considering the corresponding reduction in other system elements such as the vacuum chamber, the frame structure supporting the stage and the beam columns, and the mechanical vibration isolation. For instance, by arranging the left side and right side beam columns <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> mm apart center-to-center (distance C), a 200 mm stage can be used to inspect a 300 mm wafer (300 mm&minus;100 mm&equals;200 mm). Currently, a typical system employing a 200 mm travel stage is about 25 to 50% smaller in footprint than a system equipped with a 300 mm travel stage. Hence this reduction in travel considerably reduces system size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In the event of failure of one of the electron beam columns, for instance, due to its emitter being burned out, the entire tool need not go out of service; instead, inspection may continue with the conventional control unit (e.g., a computer, not shown) translating the wafer <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> on its stage <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> relative to the electron beam column array, to bring one of the still active electron beam columns into alignment with the wafer area that was to have been inspected by the failed electron beam column. Also, this tool may be used for large area coverage at coarser resolution to narrow down areas of likelihood for defects. Those particular identified potential defect areas may then be re-inspected with a conventional higher resolution single electron beam inspection tool to reduce the nuisance rate of false detection of defects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> While the above tool is described in the context of electron beam column techniques, it is possible to substitute ion beams, with some added complexity due to the need to generate ion beams of requisite brightness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Therefore, this disclosure is illustrative and not limiting; further modifications will be apparent to those skilled in the art in light of this disclosure and are intended to fall within the scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
