<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The signal-to-noise ratio of amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) image sensor arrays is limited by electronic noise, which is largely due to data line capacitance. To reduce data line capacitance, an air-gap (i.e., vacuum or gas-filled space) is produced at crossover points separating the data lines and gate lines. This air-gap crossover structure is formed by depositing a release material on the gate lines, forming the data lines on the release material, and then removing (etching) the release material such that the data lines form an arch extending over the gate lines. A dielectric material is then applied to strengthen the data line, and the sensor pixels are then formed. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to integrated circuit arrays, and in particular to those devices containing a pixel array. The invention is most particularly applicable to amorphous silicon X-ray image sensor arrays. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Two-dimensional amorphous silicon (A&mdash;Si:H) sensor arrays are well-known devices for real time imaging of incident high energy radiation (see R. A. Street et al., &ldquo;Large Area Image Sensor Arrays&rdquo;, in Technology and Applications of Amorphous Silicon, Editor R. A. Street, Springer Series in Materials Science 37, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 2000, chapter 4, p.147, for a general description of the structure of the arrays). Such sensor arrays are particularly advantageous for X-ray imaging because they present a relatively large size image sensor array. Each sensor operates on the principal of integrating a charge representative of the quantities of ionizing radiation incident on the sensor. In the direct detection approach, incident high-energy radiation (e.g., X-ray photons) is directly converted to a charge by the sensor. In the indirect detection approach, a phosphor converter absorbs high energy radiation (e.g., X-ray photons) and generates a proportional amount of visible light that is then converted to a charge by the sensor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> To minimize the X-ray dose to patients during medical imaging, there is a need for a-Si:H sensor arrays having the highest possible signal-to-noise ratio. In general, the signal-to-noise ratio of an image sensor array is limited by the electronic noise generated in the array, particularly for imaging conditions when the X-ray dose is low. There are a number of sources of this electronic noise in an image sensor array. A first source is generated by the resistance of the thin-film transistor (TFT) utilized to access the individual image sensors during readout, combined with the sensor capacitance, which gives a noise power of 2 kTC<highlight><subscript>s </subscript></highlight>(where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is temperature in degrees Kelvin, and C<highlight><subscript>s </subscript></highlight>is the sensor capacitance). A second source is data line capacitance C<highlight><subscript>D</subscript></highlight>, which acts on the input of the readout amplifiers of the image sensor array to contribute a noise of N<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>&plus;&bgr;C<highlight><subscript>D</subscript></highlight>, where N<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>is typically 200 electrons and &bgr; is the noise slope of about 15 e/pF. A third source is generated by thermal noise of the data line resistance, which can be represented by 4 kTR<highlight><subscript>D</subscript></highlight>&Dgr;f, where R<highlight><subscript>D </subscript></highlight>is data line resistance, and &Dgr;f is typically 1 MHz, but depends on the speed of the readout amplifier. A fourth source of electronic noise is line-correlated noise that is capacitively coupled from the gate and bias line power supplies to the data line, and is proportional to the data line capacitance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Of the various sources of electronic noise in large area and high-resolution image sensor arrays, data line capacitance tends to be the largest noise source, since it is proportional to the very large number of pixels (i.e., individual sensors and associated TFTs) coupled to each data line. For a typical array, the data line capacitance per pixel is 30-50 fF, which gives a total capacitance of about 100 pF, and an amplifier noise of about 1700 electrons. The kTC noise of each sensor is typically in the range of 300-600 electrons, depending on the size of the pixel, and the thermal noise of the data line can be made small by choosing a low resistance metal and limiting the amplifier bandwidth. The line-correlated noise can be minimized by very careful design of the power supplies, but for very large arrays is about 1000 electrons. With these parameters, data line capacitance becomes the most significant source of electronic noise, and a reduction in the data line capacitance could significantly reduce the electronic noise, which would also reduce the requirements for very high performance readout amplifiers and very low noise power supplies. Most importantly, reducing the noise produced by reducing data line capacitance would increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the sensor array, thereby facilitating medical imaging using lower X-ray doses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, what is needed is an image sensor that significantly reduces data line capacitance to significantly increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the sensor array. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to an image sensor or other integrated circuit in which data line capacitance is significantly reduced by forming an air-gap crossover structure at each data line/gate line crossover location. The air-gap crossover structure provides a substantially lower dielectric constant (when compared to conventional solid insulator material) that minimizes capacitive coupling between the data and gate lines. Accordingly, an array structure is provided that significantly reduces data line capacitance to increase the signal-to-noise ratio, thereby facilitating, for example, high resolution medical imaging using substantially lower X-ray doses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, an image sensor array includes a plurality of pixel circuits arranged in rows and columns, each pixel circuit including an a-Si:H image sensor and an access thin-film transistor (TFT) for transferring a charge from the image sensor to a data line under the control of a gate line. The gate lines are arranged such that each gate line controls one row of pixels, and the data lines are arranged such that each data line transfers charge from one column of pixels to a readout amplifier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a primary aspect of the present invention, the data lines of the image sensor array are formed such that each data line extends over the gate lines at corresponding crossover locations, and such that each data line is separated from the gate lines at the crossover locations by an air-gap (i.e., vacuum or gas-filled region), thereby minimizing capacitive coupling between the data lines and gate lines at the crossover locations by eliminating conventional solid insulators. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In accordance with other optional aspects of the present invention, data line capacitance is further reduced by forming the access TFT of each pixel using a non-overlapping source/drain structure to reduce overlap capacitance, and/or by forming the a-Si:H sensor using a thick buried insulator to reduce sensor capacitance. By combining these aspects with the air-gap crossover structure, an image sensor array is produced that exhibits significantly lower data line capacitance than that of conventional image sensor arrays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, a method for fabricating an integrated circuit array includes forming a release material pattern over a set of first (e.g., gate) lines, forming a set of second (e.g., data) lines such that a portion of the release material is located between the first and second lines at each crossover location, and then removing the release material to form an air-gap. The release material is selected such that it etches at a higher rate than the metal layers utilized to form the first and second lines, thereby allowing the release material to be selectively removed from between the first and second lines to form the air-gap crossover structure. After the release material is removed, each crossover location is overcoated with a strengthening insulator, and then an access transistor (e.g., a TFT), an insulator, and remaining portions of a pixel circuit (e.g., a sensor or liquid crystal display element) are fabricated according to known techniques.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides structures and methods for reducing address line (e.g., data line) capacitance in integrated circuit arrays by forming an air-gap crossover structure at each location where the address line crosses a noise-generating structure, such as a gate line. While the present invention is described below with specific reference to data line/gate line crossover structures, the crossover structure may be beneficially utilized to reduce address line noise from other noise generating structures. In addition, while the present invention is described below with specific reference to image sensor arrays, the present invention may be beneficially utilized in other integrated circuit arrays having pixel elements that benefit from reduced data line capacitance, such as liquid crystal displays or low voltage integrated circuits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a simplified image sensor <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, which represents an integrated circuit array according to one embodiment of the present invention. Image sensor <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes an array of pixels <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, each pixel <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> including a sensor <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, an optional storage capacitor <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, and a thin film transistor (TFT) (access transistor) <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> that may be covered by an optional light shield <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. An external scanning control circuit <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> turns on the TFTs <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> one row at a time via a series of parallel gate lines <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>. As each row of TFTs <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is turned on, an image charge is transferred from the corresponding sensors <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to a series of parallel data lines <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, which are respectively connected to external readout amplifiers <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>. At the same time, readout amplifiers <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> reset the potential at each sensor <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The resulting amplified signal for each row is multiplexed by a parallel-to-serial converter or multiplexer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, and then transmitted to an analog-to-digital converter or digitizer <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a pixel circuit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of image sensor <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in additional detail. Each TFT <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> has three electrical connections: a source S connected to sensor <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and pixel storage capacitor <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>; a drain D connected to a data line <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> that is shared by all pixels of the same column; and a gate G formed by a corresponding gate line <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> that is shared by all pixels in the same row. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, the signal-to-noise ratio of a-Si:H image sensor array <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is limited by electronic noise, and the main contribution to that noise in present devices is the data line capacitance C<highlight><subscript>D </subscript></highlight>of each data line <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> that forms the input to readout amplifiers <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). As also discussed above, the data line capacitance C<highlight><subscript>D </subscript></highlight>has several sources arising from the design of sensor array <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Data line capacitance C<highlight><subscript>D </subscript></highlight>can be expressed as the sum of the individual pixel capacitance C<highlight><subscript>P </subscript></highlight>at each pixel and the number of pixels N (i.e., C<highlight><subscript>D</subscript></highlight>&equals;NC<highlight><subscript>P</subscript></highlight>). Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the present inventors have determined that pixel capacitance C<highlight><subscript>P </subscript></highlight>of each sensor pixel <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> can be expressed by the following Equation 1:</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Cross-over capacitance C<highlight><subscript>DG </subscript></highlight>is the capacitance generated at gate line/data line cross-over <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, which is an essential part of the addressed array design shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, and is approximately represented by Equation 2</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In Equation 2, C<highlight><subscript>D1 </subscript></highlight>represents the capacitance per unit area of the dielectric material separating gate line <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> and data line <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, W<highlight><subscript>G </subscript></highlight>is the width of gate line <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>, and W<highlight><subscript>D </subscript></highlight>is the width of data line <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Overlap capacitance C<highlight><subscript>TO </subscript></highlight>is produced by the drain/gate overlap of TFT <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> when turned off, and is approximately represented by Equation 3:</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>C</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>TO</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&equals;C</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>D2</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>WD</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>o</subscript></highlight>&emsp;&emsp;Eq. 3</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In Equation 3, C<highlight><subscript>D2 </subscript></highlight>represents the capacitance per unit area of the dielectric material located in the TFT overlap, W is the TFT width, and D<highlight><subscript>o </subscript></highlight>is the size of the overlap. Note that the channel capacitance of TFT <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is ignored because only one of many TFTs in each column is turned on at any given time. Light shield capacitance C<highlight><subscript>TS </subscript></highlight>represents the capacitance between TFT <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and optional light shield <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, which is usually placed over TFT <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and is assumed to have a width equal to that of gate line <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>. With this assumption, light shield capacitance C<highlight><subscript>TS </subscript></highlight>is approximately represented by the Equation <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>:</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In equation 4, C<highlight><subscript>D3 </subscript></highlight>represents the capacitance per unit area of the dielectric material between TFT <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and light shield <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, W is the TFT/light shield width, and D<highlight><subscript>C </subscript></highlight>is the size of the drain contact. Finally, sensor capacitance C<highlight><subscript>DS </subscript></highlight>represents the capacitance between data line <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> and sensor <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> (in cases where sensor <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and data line <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> overlap), and can be approximated by multiplying the capacitance (C<highlight><subscript>D4</subscript></highlight>) per unit area of the dielectric material between data line <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> and sensor <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> with the area of sensor <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. When sensor <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and data line <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> do not overlap, sensor capacitance C<highlight><subscript>DS </subscript></highlight>is generated solely by fringing effects, discussed below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> For comparison purposes, the above equations were utilized to calculate the data line capacitance for a conventional image sensor array including 1536 by 1920 pixels. Each sensor <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> has a size of 127 by 127 microns. The dielectric insulator used in each TFT <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is silicon oxy-nitride having a thickness about 1 micron, and each TFT <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> has length of 11 microns and a width of 20 microns. The source and drain overlaps of TFT <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> are 3 microns. With this conventional image sensor the capacitive components making up data line capacitance C<highlight><subscript>D </subscript></highlight>for each pixel circuit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are C<highlight><subscript>DG</subscript></highlight>&equals;12 fF, C<highlight><subscript>TO</subscript></highlight>&equals;14 fF, C<highlight><subscript>TS</subscript></highlight>&equals;8 fF, and C<highlight><subscript>DS</subscript></highlight>&equals;10 fF, for a total of 44 fF/pixel. In estimating these capacitance components there are some fringe fields (fringing effects) that make the effective areas larger than the actual geometrical areas. In the calculations above the chosen values for pixel area are increased to account for these fringing effects. However, when the above analysis is applied to high fill factor and direct detection sensor arrays, the data line capacitance can reach 90 fF/pixel. Such high fill factor and direct detection sensor arrays are important because they are intended for high performance, high resolution imaging by allowing increased sensor coverage of the pixel, higher resolution designs and higher X-ray sensitivity. To facilitate high fill factor, data line capacitance C<highlight><subscript>D </subscript></highlight>is increased because the gate-to-data crossovers are located between the metal layers utilized to form the gate line and data line, which increases the capacitance by about a factor of four. Also, the sensor is placed over the data line in these high fill factor sensor arrays, which further increases capacitance. Therefore, for the same array and pixel parameters utilized above, the component capacitances would be approximately C<highlight><subscript>DG</subscript></highlight>&equals;48 fF, C<highlight><subscript>TO</subscript></highlight>&equals;14 fF, C<highlight><subscript>TS</subscript></highlight>&equals;8 fF, and C<highlight><subscript>DS</subscript></highlight>&equals;20 fF, which produces the 90 fF/pixel data line capacitance mentioned above. Note that more recently developed high fill factor array designs have reduced the gate and data line widths, with a corresponding reduction in the capacitance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, sensor array <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is modified to reduce data line capacitance by providing a bridge structure formed at each data line/gate line (metal) crossover <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) that reduces the crossover capacitance C<highlight><subscript>DG </subscript></highlight>in comparison with conventional solid dielectric crossover structures by providing a vacuum or gas-filled space (referred to herein as an &ldquo;air-gap&rdquo;) between the data and gate lines at each crossover <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. In combination with various optional design techniques, some previously proposed, the air-gap crossover structure of the present invention produces a sensor array exhibiting greatly reduced data line capacitance C<highlight><subscript>D</subscript></highlight>. As discussed in detail below, a first optional design technique reduces the overlap capacitance C<highlight><subscript>TO </subscript></highlight>component of data line capacitance C<highlight><subscript>D </subscript></highlight>by utilizing a self-aligned TFT structure. According to another design technique directed to high fill factor pixel circuits, the light shield capacitance C<highlight><subscript>TS </subscript></highlight>and sensor capacitance C<highlight><subscript>DS </subscript></highlight>component of data line capacitance C<highlight><subscript>D </subscript></highlight>are reduced by providing a thick, low dielectric constant insulation layer between the TFT and the pixel sensor. Both the self-aligned TFT structure and the thick dielectric are previously proposed, and can be separately or in combination with the air-gap crossover structure of the present invention to reduce data line capacitance C<highlight><subscript>D</subscript></highlight>. Note that when one or more of the overlap capacitance C<highlight><subscript>TO</subscript></highlight>, the light shield capacitance C<highlight><subscript>TS</subscript></highlight>, and the sensor capacitance C<highlight><subscript>DS </subscript></highlight>are reduced using these design techniques, the crossover capacitance C<highlight><subscript>DG </subscript></highlight>becomes a significant source of data line capacitance C<highlight><subscript>D</subscript></highlight>. Accordingly, when combined with the self-aligned TFT and thick dielectric, the air-gap formed at each data line/gate line (metal) crossover <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) produces a sensor array in which the capacitance C<highlight><subscript>D </subscript></highlight>of data lines <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is dramatically reduced over conventional sensor arrays, resulting in a greatly improved imager performance at lower X-ray doses. </paragraph>

Note that passivation (insulation) layers are omitted from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> to facilitate the following description. As discussed above with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, pixel circuit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> includes a sensor <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, a capacitor <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, and an access TFT <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> that is connected to a gate line <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> and a data line <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a primary aspect of the present invention, an air-gap crossover structure is provided between gate line <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> and data line <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> at crossover location <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> that provides an air-gap <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> to minimize capacitive coupling between data line <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and gate line <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> at crossover location <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. Air-gap <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is formed in accordance with the method illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>(A) through <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>(E), which are described in detail below. Optional spaced-apart support pads <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> are located on opposite sides of air-gap <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> to support and maintain the position of data line <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> relative to gate line <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(A), a method for making image sensor array <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> (described above with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) begins with the formation of gate lines <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> (shown in end view) on a substrate <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> (e.g., silicon). In one embodiment, gate lines <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> are formed by depositing a first metal layer (e.g., Cr or another suitable metal), patterning the first metal layer, and then etching using, for example, Cr, cerium ammonium nitrate and acetic acid according to known techniques. Optional spaced-apart data line support pads <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> are also patterned and etched from the first metal layer using the same process utilized to form gate lines <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(B) shows a subsequent step of forming a release material <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> over the gate lines <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, release material <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> is formed by depositing a second layer (e.g., at least one of photoresist, Si, and Al), patterning the second layer, and then etching using known techniques. Note that when spaced-apart data line support pads <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> are provided, release material <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> is etched to define windows <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> that expose upper surfaces of the spaced-apart data line support pads <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Note that the term &ldquo;release material&rdquo; is used in the field of micro-electrical mechanical systems (MEMS) to describe an intermediate layer that is removed to form a free standing structure. A typical MEMS arrangement includes a metal bridge or cantilever structure having at least one anchored portion secured to a substrate, and a free standing portion initially formed on a pad of material (the &ldquo;release material&rdquo;) that, when exposed to a selected etchant, is etched at a substantially higher rate that the metal portion. Because the function of release material <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> is otherwise similar to that used in the context of such MEMS structures, the same term is utilized herein to describe the formation of air-gap <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(C), data lines <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> are then formed such that each data line <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> extends over gate lines <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> at corresponding crossover locations <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, and is separated from a portion of gate lines <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> located directly over gate line <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> by a release material portion <highlight><bold>417</bold></highlight> which has a thickness in the range of 0.2 to 1 micron. In one embodiment, data lines <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> are formed by depositing and patterning a second metal layer (e.g., TiW), and then etching the second metal layer using known techniques. When optional spaced-apart data line support pads <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> are provided, data lines <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> are formed such that they extend through openings <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> to contact associated pairs of spaced-apart data line support pad <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. Note that the etchant used to form data lines <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> (e.g., hydrogen peroxide) is selected such that it does not damage release material <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(D) shows a subsequent release (etch) process during which release material is etched using a suitable etchant <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> in a manner that does not significantly damage data lines <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and gate lines <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, release material portion <highlight><bold>417</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(C) is removed from crossover location <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> such that an air-gap <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is defined between data line <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and gate line <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>. This release process is performed using, for example, a mixture of phosphoric and nitric acid (for Al release material), standard resist developer (for photoresist release material), or XeF<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(for amorphous silicon release material) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(E) shows the formation of an optional strengthening insulator <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> on data lines <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> at the crossover locations <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. A suitable strengthening insulator <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> includes Silicon-Nitride (SiN) having a thickness of 0.1 to 0.3 microns, and is formed using a plasma-enhanced CVD process according to known techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, in one embodiment, the formation of data line <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> also comprises forming a lateral portion <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, which is formed using the second metal layer, and a metal via <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, which is formed using subsequent metal layers (discussed below) to provide electrical contact to TFT <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> (discussed below). In an alternative embodiment, a lateral portion can be formed using the first metal layer and extends from support pads <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> After gate lines <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> and data lines <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> are formed in the manner described above, the fabrication process proceeds with the formation of sensor <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, capacitor <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, and TFT <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the disclosed embodiment, sensor <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> includes an a-Si:H (charge sensing) region <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> formed by a continuous a-Si:H layer (not shown) that is sandwiched between an upper metal plate <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> and a lower metal plate <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>. A&mdash;Si:H region <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> includes a thin p-type doped upper layer <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>-p located next to upper plate <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, a thicker undoped middle layer <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>-u, and a thin n-type doped lower layer <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>-n located next to lower plate <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>. Upper layer <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>-p, middle layer <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>-u, and lower layer <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>-n are formed according to known practices, and the order of upper layer <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>-p and lower layer <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>-n can be reversed (i.e., with n-type doping in the upper layer and p-type doping in the lower layer). Upper plate <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> contacts a bias (metal) line <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight>, and is formed from a conductive transparent material (e.g., Indium-Tin Oxide (ITO)) to facilitate transmission of light beams <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> into doped a-Si:H region <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. Lower metal plate <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> includes a portion that contacts a source terminal of access TFT <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, which is discussed below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Capacitor <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is formed by lower plate <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> of sensor <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and a third plate <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> that is separated from lower plate <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> by a passivation (insulation) layer (not shown). The capacitance of a-Si:H sensor <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, which is determined in part by the size of third plate <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, is selected to facilitate either radiographic or fluoroscopic imaging operations. In one embodiment, third plate <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is formed using the first metal layer that is used to form gate lines <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>, or the second metal layer that is used to form data lines <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In accordance with an optional aspect of the present invention, TFT <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is fabricated in accordance with the teachings of U.S. Pat. No. 6,107,641 (Mei et al.), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. According to the teachings of Mei et al., source/gate and drain gate overlaps are eliminated using a laser doping technique to form a self-aligned source region <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> and a self-aligned drain region <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight> that are separated by a relatively undoped channel region <highlight><bold>346</bold></highlight>. Source region <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> and drain region <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight> (as well as channel region <highlight><bold>346</bold></highlight>) are formed from a continuous a-Si:H layer sandwiched between Nitride layers, and upon which is formed an optical filter island <highlight><bold>348</bold></highlight>. Optical filter island <highlight><bold>348</bold></highlight> includes at least three layers of materials having differing indexes of refraction (e.g., alternating layers of SiN and SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, with SiN being located in the uppermost and lowermost layers), and is utilized during laser doping to resist the diffusion of dopant into channel region <highlight><bold>346</bold></highlight>. Optical filter island <highlight><bold>348</bold></highlight> is formed by patterning a resist layer using backside exposure (i.e., through the underlying substrate) in which gate line <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> acts as a mask, thereby self-aligning optical filter island <highlight><bold>337</bold></highlight> to gate line <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>. After forming optical island <highlight><bold>348</bold></highlight>, a doping source film is positioned over source region <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> and drain region <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight>, and a laser beam is directed from above to ablate the source film, thereby releasing energetic dopant atoms that enter (dope) source region <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> and drain region <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight>. Importantly, optical filter island <highlight><bold>348</bold></highlight> is opaque (for example by reflectance via interference) to the laser beam. Therefore, the region under island <highlight><bold>348</bold></highlight>, namely channel <highlight><bold>346</bold></highlight>, remains relatively undoped. After source region <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> and drain region <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight> are formed, metal drain contact <highlight><bold>341</bold></highlight> and a metal source contact <highlight><bold>349</bold></highlight> are formed (i.e., using the same metal layer that is used to form lower plate <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>) to provide respective contacts to data line <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> (via lateral portion <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> and metal via <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>) and to lower plate <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> of sensor <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Referring to the upper portion of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, pixel circuit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> also includes an optional phosphor converter <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> that facilitates indirect detection by converting incident high-energy beams <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> into light beams <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> that are passed into sensor <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional side view showing a pixel circuit <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> of a high fill factor sensor array according to another embodiment of the present invention. Pixel circuit <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> is formed on a substrate <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> and includes a gate line <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> (shown in side view), a first passivation layer <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> (e.g., SiN) formed over gate line <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>, and an a-Si:H region <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> and a second passivation region <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight> (e.g., SiN) formed on first passivation layer <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>. Formed over this structure is a first (bottom) buried insulator <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> upon which is formed a data line <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> (shown in end view), and a second (top) buried insulator <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight>. Formed over top buried insulator <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight> is an a-Si:H sensor layer (charge sensing region) <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> and a top ITO contact layer <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>. The fabrication of pixel circuit <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> is described in detail in &ldquo;Simulated and measured data-line parasitic capacitance of amorphous silicon large-area image sensor arrays&rdquo;, M. Mulato, J. P. Lu and R. A. Street, Journal of Applied Physics, Vol. 89, page 638 (2000), which is incorporated herein in its entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, second buried insulator <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight> is formed using a resin derived from B-staged bisbenzocyclobutene (BCB) monomers, such as the polymer-based CYCLOTENE&reg; Resin produced by The Dow Chemical Company. This BCB material has a low dielectric constant and can be formed in a relatively thick (e.g., 3 to 5 microns) layer over data line <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>, thereby reducing the light shield capacitance C<highlight><subscript>TS </subscript></highlight>and the sensor capacitance C<highlight><subscript>DS </subscript></highlight>capacitance components of data line capacitance (see Equation 1, above). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> By combining the various design techniques described above, the present inventors were able to significantly reduce the data line capacitance of large image sensor arrays. When applied to large arrays, the combination of the BCB buried insulator structure of pixel circuit <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) combined with the air-gap crossover structure and non-overlapping TFT structure of pixel structure <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> (described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) produced a pixel array exhibiting total data line capacitance in the range of 5-8 fF/pixel (data line capacitance without these design techniques was in the range of 44 to 79 fF/pixel). It is further noted that the BCB buried insulator of pixel circuit <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> and the non-overlapping TFT structure of pixel structure <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> accounted for only about &frac12; of the resulting data line capacitance reduction, and the greatest contribution was generated by introducing the air-gap crossover structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Although the present invention has been described with respect to certain specific embodiments, it will be clear to those skilled in the art that the inventive features of the present invention are applicable to other embodiments as well. For example, sensor arrays incorporating the present invention may be modified for indirect detection as well as direct detection methods according to known practices. Further, as mentioned above, the air-gap structure and fabrication method may be beneficially utilized in other integrated circuit types. Those familiar with integrated circuit structures will recognize such modifications can be utilized without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention described herein. </paragraph>
