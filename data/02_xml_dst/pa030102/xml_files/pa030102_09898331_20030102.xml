<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">Disposable dental mouthpiece-strip which has been pre-impregnated with dental substance which can either be placed in the mouth by the user or inserted in the mouth by a dentist for oral treatments, such as teeth whitening treatments, fluoride treatments, or medical treatments, such as the application of anasthetic or antimicrobal/antiseptic treatments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="A-0002" lvl="0">The mouthpiece-strip is made with a foldable structure such as a thin strip of wax with a section of porous material (sponge) that holds the treatment dental product (liquid or gel). The mouthpiece-strip is disposable; the amount of time it is worn is determined by the type of dental treatment. The mouthpiece-strip may be adjusted in size by cutting it with scissors. The wax used for the mouthpiece is non-toxic and allows for a perfect adjustment in the mouth by contouring to the teeth during adjustment by the user. To enhance the fit in the mouth, the inner surface of the mouthpiece-strip may contain a thin layer of non-toxic sticky adhesive. The porous (sponge) strip attached to the wax strip is an inert, nontoxic material which is easy to process and inexpensive. It is attached to the wax strip with a non-toxic adhesive. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to dental treatment, specifically to an improved disposable mouthpiece for delivering dental treatment substances. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND&mdash;DESCRIPTION OF PRIOR ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> NEW USE: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In the past, conventional dental mouthpiece trays used in delivering dental substances have required a patient to go to a dental office and have an impression taken from which a plaster case would be made and over which a mouth piece would be formed by thermal techniques. Other, over the counter dental trays have been in the form of a standard, inaccurate one-size-fits-all device, which requires the user to use the same tray over and over, providing inaccurate results and limited hygene. A third method has been to provide for a pre-adapted shaped mouth piece, which is adjusted to the mouth&apos;s contours by the user&apos;s softening the device in boiling water and then biting on the device to form an impression. After the impression is formed, the user fills up the tray with dental substance. This will not result in a very accurate fit either, and the user also reuses the same, inaccurate tray over and over for repeated treatments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> This invention discloses a mouthpiece in the form of a disposable, wax-based strip adhered to a sponge strip. The sponge strip is pre-impregnated with high viscosity sustained release dental compositions, such as tooth bleaching or flouride compositions, for treating tooth and/or gum surfaces. A user takes the pre-impregnated, maleable wax/sponge strip and accurately forms it to the mouth&apos;s own contours for sustained delivery of dental compositions. Unlike prior similar items, the device may be pre-impregnated with dental treatment substance and it is disposable. Unlike dental trays which are used for repeated treatments and which require an initial contouring process and repeated impregnation of dental substances, this device is pre-impregnated with dental substances, is disposable, and is self-adjusted to the user&apos;s mouth contours by the user&apos;s self-adjustment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The mouthpiece described in Fischer, U.S. Pat. No. 6,086,855 (2000) is an improved dental tray having reservoirs(or &ldquo;scallops&rdquo;)for holding dental composition adjacent to the tooth surface. This tray is used in combination with a dental composition, which is made especially viscous by including a high carboxypolymethylene concentration, so that dental compositions inserted into the tray are not diluted by the user&apos;s own saliva. It is the viscostity of the carboxypolymethylene composition which adds tackiness to the dental composition and helps to retain the tray in place by acting like glue against the teeth in the dental tray. This method requires someone to obtain an impression of the user&apos;s teeth, preparing a stone cast from the impression, forming a dental tray from the stone cast, and then scalloping the dental tray. The tray is then used over and over again, by washing it and then re-impregnating it with dental substance with each use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Similarly, the dental tray in Fischer, U.S. Pat. No. 6,036,943 (2000) discloses a dental tray which is thin-walled, flexible and lightweight, which is then impregnated with a sticky, glue-like dental substance matrix material. The material again includes a tackifying carboxypolymethylene concentration to improve its sticky, glue-like quality against the teeth and to hold the mouthpiece in place, and the mouthpiece is used over and over again, by washing and then re-impregnating the mouthpiece with matrix material upon each use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> See also, generally, Fischer, U.S. Pat. No. 5,985,249 (1999), Fischer, U.S. Pat. No. 5,851,512 (1998), Fischer, U.S. Pat. No. 5,759,038 (1998), Fischer, U.S. Pat. No. 5,725,843 (1998), Munro, U.S. Pat. No. Re. 34,196 (1993), Munro, U.S. Pat. No. 4,990,089 (1991). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In Torres-Zaragoza, U.S. Pat. No. 4,983,381 (1991) teeth whitening is accomplished by covering the crowns of a patient&apos;s teeth with a metallic plate containing a thermic heating unit and an absorbent material with a chemical whitening product. During treatment a separator product and chemical and physical (metallic) protectors are used so that the whitening product remains insulated in the tooth for up to 48 hours after treatment. Ultra violet rays are then applied to &lsquo;seal in&rsquo; the whitening product on the tooth. This necessarily requires an office visit where the apparatus inserted in the mouth upon each treatment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Smith, U.S. Pat. No. 4,902,227 (1990) is a molded, one piece plastic dental tray for applying dental substances. See also,generally, Osborne, U.S. Pat. No. 4,560,351 (1985), Schaeffer, U.S. Pat. No. 4,528,180 (1985), Seid, U.S. Pat. No. 4,428,373 (1984), Aardse, U.S. Pat. No. 4,376,628 (1983), Olson, U.S. Pat. No. 4,251,507 (1981), Jacobs, U.S. Pat. No. 4,173,505 (1979), Lentine, U.S. Pat. No. 4,173,219 (1979), Quinby, U.S. Pat. No. 4,164,940 (1979), Weitzman, U.S. Pat. No. 4,064,628 (1977), and Gores, U.S. Pat. No. Re. 28,667. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The dental tray disclosed in Weitzman, U.S. Pat. No. 3,955,281, is a disposable dental tray having a U-shaped cross-section and containing a flexible polymeric foam material. The flexibility of the tray is designed to provide a relatively snug seal between the tray perimeter and the peridontal tissue so as to prevent excessive loss of dental substance (which must be impregnated into the tray) through dilution from saliva. The interior recess of U-shaped cross-section formed in the tray is configured with indentations along its bottom surface and side walls which anatomically mate with the mouth&apos;s dentition pattern. This configuration, however, necessarily results in uneven application of dental substance, since the inner portion of the mouthpiece is &lsquo;formed&rsquo; when the user&apos;s teeth press against the foamy substance and squish the dental substance upwards and out of the tray, toward the gums, in the process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The present mouthpiece disclosed in this invention is disposable after each use, and is applied to the teeth by the user himself for accurate fitting around the user&apos;s own, unique teeth. Dental substances, such as whitening agents, fluoridation agents, anticarciogenic agents, antimicrobal agents, and desensitizing agents, etc., are applied to the mouth and gums by sponge material which has already been pre-impregnated with such substance, resulting in an easy, hygenic, uniform and effective method of treatment. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY INCLUDING OBJECTS AND ADVANTAGES </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> A means for delivering dental treatment substances to the teeth and gums comprising a flexible, malleable strip which is pre-impregnated with dental treatment substance and wrapped by the user around the teeth and gums. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">OBJECTS AND ADVANTAGES </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, several objects and advantages of the invention include the fact that the mouthpiece is disposable, and therefore more hygenic and sanitary than a pre-formed mouthpiece which is subjected to multiple uses in the mouth. The mouthpiece is also highly accurate, because its soft composition allows the user to form the mouthpiece around his teeth, so that it fits his specific teeth and gums. The mouthpiece also delivers uniform application of dental substance, since the mouthpiece&apos;s inner sponge is uniformally pre-impregnated with dental substance and since the sponge does not allow the substance to be squished out of the mouthpiece or diluted by contact with saliva. The sponge in the mouthpiece may also be used after oral surgery, not only to deliver post surgical substances, such as antiseptic or other healing agents, but also to facilitate healing by acting as a kind of &lsquo;band aid&rsquo; on the teeth and/or gums after surgery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The mouthpiece will give the dentist a very convenient tool for various applications in the mouth for tooth or gum treatments. No costly custom made dental trays are required to apply tooth whitening or fluoration gel. This allows the dentist to provide the patient with a ready-to-use mouthpiece regardless of the patient&apos;s mouth shape or size. It can be used in the lower or upper jaw without any waiting period, as is required when making custom trays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The purpose of this mouthpiece-strip is to give the dentist and his patients a very convenient tool for various applications in the mouth for tooth or gum treatments. This allows the dentist to provide the patient with a ready-to-use mouthpiece regardless of mouth size or particular idiosyncrasies, and to be used in the upper and lower jaws without any waiting period and without the necessity of multiple office visits, as needed with many custom trays. The patient will be able to adjust the size of the mouthpiece-strip by cutting it and will be able to use a new mouthpiece every day. In case of surgery, the dentist can use the mouthpiece, or a part of it, impregnated with an antiseptic, on the operated area to increase the patient&apos;s comfort and to promote healing. A surgical variation of the strip may be made with a foldable strip made out of a light curing resin, which will allow the dentist to harden the strip in place so that it will stay in place for several days during post operative healing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Still further objects and advantages will become apparent from a consideration of the ensuing description and accompanying drawings. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>the mouthpiece is made as a foldable rectangular structure from a flexible material, such as a thin strip of wax. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. (The user folds the structure around the teeth and gums, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, and as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>.) A section of porous material, such as sponge, that will hold the treatment dental product (ie., liquid or gel) has been attached to the strip. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The thickness of the strip may vary depending on the type of dental treatment. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the porous section covers the entire length of the strip, it but can vary in its width; therefore, the proportion between the surface of the foldable rectangular structure (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) and the porous, sponge material (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) will vary according to the product used in treatment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> For example, after gum surgery (when a form of the mouthpiece would be impregnated with antiseptic or pain killer) the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> sponge part would be wider and placed differently on the strip in order to cover the gum surface which has been operated on. For tooth whitening or fluoridation, however, the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> sponge part would more likely cover the tooth surface, and may be narrower. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> To increase the fit in the mouth, the inner surface of the stip may be made with a thin layer of nontoxic sticky adhesive. The porous (sponge) structure is an inert, nontoxic material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Preferred Embodiment&mdash;Operation </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Operation and use of the mouthpiece is simple and straightforward. The <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>combined wax/sponge strip is placed in the mouth, and the user folds it to fit around his teeth, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. The strip can be used with a variety of dental treatment substances (liquids or gels), including, for example, gels for whitening, or an anesthetic product for superficial anesthesia before tooth cleaning with sensitive patients or with an antimicrobal or antiseptic agent for post-surgery use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The mouthpiece is disposable and therefore is to be used once and replaced by a new mouthpiece for each treatment. The period of time the mouthpiece is worn will vary according to the type of treatment used with the mouthpiece. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The patient will also be able to adjust the size of the mouthpiece by cutting it and using a new one every day. In the cawse or surgery, the dentist can use this mouthpiece, or a part of it, impregnated with an antiseptic on the operated area to increase the patient&apos;s comfort and to allow daily cleaning or antiseptic treatment of the affected area. </paragraph>
