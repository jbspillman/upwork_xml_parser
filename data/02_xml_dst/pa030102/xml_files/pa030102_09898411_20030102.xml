<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The present invention provides for an integrally weighted base suitable for attachment to a bottom surface of an enclosure to form an integrally weighted cabinet. The integrally weighted cabinet is able to satisfy load bearing and tip over standards without requiring the addition of separate weights. The base preferably includes a frame and fill material disposed within the frame. The frame may be metal or plastic. Fill material is poured into the frame and allowed to set. The fill material may be any suitable material having a density sufficient to act as a weight or counterbalance, such as, e.g., concrete, a concrete and fiber mixture, metal, or a concrete and metal mixture. The base may further include a plurality of openings to dissipate heat from within the interior space of the cabinet. In one implementation of the present invention, the base replaces a bottom panel of a typical PTV cabinet and further eliminates the need for attaching separate weights onto a bottom panel of a typical PTV cabinet. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to projection television sets, and more particularly to an integrally weighted base that facilitates structural and operational stability in a projection television enclosure. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Projection televisions (PTVs) or &ldquo;big screen&rdquo; TVs are a popular alternative to traditional picture tube televisions because they provide comparably larger viewable screens that cannot be efficiently produced using conventional picture tubes. PTV cabinets are presently designed to hold electrical and optical components, as required, to decipher and project a television picture on a screen generally on the front of the cabinet. The most common PTV on the market today projects pictures created via appropriate electrical and optical components onto a mirror within a box containing the entire apparatus so that the picture reflected to a screen is as large as possible for the volume occupied by the cabinet enclosing it. Currently, PTV screens typically range in size from about 45 to about 73 inches along their diagonal, while the cabinets typically range in size from about 48 inches to over 65 inches in height, from about 38 inches to over 65 inches in width, and from about 22 inches to over 29 inches in depth. The cabinets are assembled in an aesthetically appealing manner as required to hold the electrical components, light generator(s), and lenses, mirror and screen in the relationship required to obtain the desired televised picture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Most PTVs marketed today include a cabinet constructed from multiple pieces of particleboard cut and glued together. Some cabinets also have plastic components held to the basic cabinet structure with screws or other fasteners. The number of plastic components and particleboard pieces needed to form such cabinets typically range in excess of fifty (50) pieces. Because of the size of PTVs, and the particleboard from which the cabinets are typically constructed, PTVs tend to be quite heavy and difficult to maneuver. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Alternative methods of manufacture are available that may reduce the overall weight of these cabinets and the number of components necessary to construct such cabinets. For instance, injection molding could be used to form such cabinets out of plastic. Another alternative would be to vacuum form the cabinetry out of plastic. A further alternative would be to form the cabinet out of molded plastic foam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The use of lighter weight materials to manufacture PTV cabinets leads to an additional problem in that the newer, light weight cabinets are easier to tip over relative to the traditional particle board cabinets. For example, in addition to being lighter in weight, newer PTV cabinets are also increasingly shallower in depth relative to traditional cabinets. The shallower depth cabinets have a smaller footprint but still generally maintain the same height as traditional PTV cabinets. Consequently, tip over for the newer cabinets becomes more likely when compared with the traditional cabinets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In order to ensure that they produce PTVs that are not likely to tip over, PTV manufacturers typically strive to meet certain safety standards with respect to PTVs and PTV enclosures. One current standard is the Underwriters Laboratories (&ldquo;UL&rdquo;) load standard. The UL load standard requires that a PTV cabinet must be able to withstand 25 lbs of force applied to any extremity of the cabinet without tipping over. Without the addition of some weight to the lower portion of the lighter, shallower PTV cabinets, these cabinets are more likely to fail the UL tip over test when compared with traditional particle board cabinets. To address this problem, those skilled in the art currently add counterweights to the base or lower portions of the lighter weight and shallower cabinets in order to enable these cabinets to withstand at least 25 lbs of force applied to any of their extremities without tipping over. Using one example calculation, the total weight for a PTV cabinet to avoid tip over is determined using the following formula: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>Minimum Weight&equals;(25 lbs)(Height of the Cabinet/Depth of the Cabinet). </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Turning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> conventional enclosure <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of a PTV <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is illustrated. The conventional enclosure <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes top <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, bottom <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, front <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and rear <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> panels. Side panels connecting the front <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and rear <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> panels are also included, but not illustrated. The conventional enclosure <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is typically divided by an internal wall <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> into two compartments, i.e., an upper <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a lower <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> compartment. Cathode ray tubes (CRTs) <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and printed wiring boards (PWBs) <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are typically mounted in the lower compartment <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, while a mirror M and a screen S are mounted in the upper compartment <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. At least one projection lens <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> typically extends from the lower compartment <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> into the upper compartment <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> through the internal wall <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The upper compartment <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is typically tightly sealed from the lower compartment <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to protect the inside of the upper compartment <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> from dust and other foreign materials. The lower compartment <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> typically includes one or more sets of ventilation holes to exhaust heat radiating from the CRTs <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the PWBs <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. As shown, the lower compartment <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may include a first set of ventilation holes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> positioned adjacent the top of the lower compartment <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and a second set of ventilation holes <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> positioned adjacent the bottom of the lower compartment <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. When the enclosure <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is made shallower and/or is constructed using lighter weight materials and methods, such as those previously discussed, counterweights <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are typically positioned in the lower compartment <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and normally on top of the bottom panel <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The counterweights <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> increase the enclosure&apos;s total weight and lower the enclosure&apos;s center of gravity. As a result, the counterweights <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> increase the amount of force required to tip over the enclosure <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Currently, counterweights <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, which may be metal, clay, or concrete bricks, additional particle board base pieces, or any other suitable counterweights, are tied or otherwise physically attached to the bottom panel <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the enclosure <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The number of counterweights <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> used in the cabinet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, to enable the enclosure <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to pass the UL tip over test, may be determined with the aforementioned formula. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The current methods for balancing a shallower, lighter PTV cabinet result in several disadvantages. For example, the use of additional particle board bases to increase the weight and stability of these cabinets often requires the additional use of forest products, thereby contributing to long term environmental deleterious effects. Also, the additional step of adding a separate weight to a cabinet increases the complexity and cost of manufacturing the lighter weight PTV cabinets. There is also a danger that the weights may not be properly secured to the cabinet during construction, thereby resulting in safety issues should the weights become dislodged during transport of the cabinet, or during the lifetime of the cabinet. For example, the weights may become dislodged and repositioned in an area that causes the cabinet to become unbalanced and more likely to tip over. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Those skilled in the art have failed to provide for a light weight PTV cabinet capable of passing standard load tests without the addition of costly counterweights. Thus, it would be desirable to provide for a PTV cabinet or an integrally weighted base suitable for attachment to a PTV cabinet that is easy and less costly to manufacture, mitigates environmental damage by decreasing the reliance on wood as a material for counterweights, is less vulnerable to manufacturing irregularities, and results in a cabinet that meets any applicable load or tip over standards for PTV cabinets. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to an integrally weighted base for use with an enclosure to form an integrally weighted PTV cabinet. The base acts to stabilize the cabinet and enables the cabinet to satisfy load and tip over standards. The base of the present invention is particularly useful when implemented as part of a lighter weight PTV cabinet, but is also capable of being used with traditional, wood-based PTV cabinets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, a base for attachment to a bottom of an enclosure, thereby forming a cabinet, is provided. The enclosure has a plurality of side panels that form a footprint. The base is configured to conform to the footprint of the enclosure. The base includes a frame that conforms to the footprint and fill material set within the frame. The fill material may be concrete, metal, a mixture of concrete and fiber, a mixture of concrete and metal, or any other suitable material. The frame may be metal, plastic, or any other suitable material. Additionally, the frame may be divided into a raised area with a top surface and a lower region adjacent the raised area. In this embodiment, the fill material is disposed within the lower region of the frame. A plurality of openings may also be provided on the top surface of the raised area, allowing for ventilation to facilitate the dissipation of heat from within the interior of a cabinet. Elevated portions having openings configured for receiving an attachment element may be provided within the lower region that allows for a component to be secured to the base. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, a base is provided that is formed from a hardened material conformed to the footprint of an enclosure. In this embodiment, the base does not include a separate frame. The base may be formed of metal, a mixture of concrete and fiber, or a mixture of concrete and metal. The base may be divided into a raised area having a top surface and a lower region adjacent the raised area. The top surface of the raised area may further include a plurality of ventilation openings allowing for heat dissipation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment of the present invention is a cabinet for a PTV having an enclosure with a mirror, a plurality of CRTs, a projection lens, and a plurality of panels, and a base attached to the enclosure. The enclosure preferably includes a top panel, a front panel, a rear panel, and side panels extending between the front and rear panels. Attached to the top portion, and opposite the top panel of the enclosure, is a base having a frame and fill material disposed in the frame. The base provides stability to the cabinet and enables the cabinet to satisfy standard load bearing requirements. The base may also include at least one raised area, each raised area having a top surface, at least one lower region adjacent to each raised area, and fill material deposited into each lower region. The top surface of the raised region may include a plurality of vent openings allowing heat built up within the enclosure to dissipate therethrough. In another embodiment, additional elevated regions are present on the base that allow for components to be securably attached to the base. The fill material is preferably a material sufficient to provide the necessary weight to the enclosure. Exemplary fill materials include concrete, a concrete and fiber mixture, a concrete and metal mixture, and a metallic material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In another aspect of the present invention, a method of manufacturing an integrally weighted base suitable for attachment to an enclosure of a television cabinet is provided. A frame is manufactured that conforms to the footprint exhibited by the panels of the enclosure. The frame may be, for example, a sheet metal stamping, molded plastic, metal casting, or wood. A fill material, which may be, e.g., concrete, a concrete and fiber mixture, a concrete and metal mixture, or a metal substance, is poured into the frame and allowed to set or harden. To form a frameless base, a mold is formed that conforms to the footprint of the enclosure and a compound is poured into the mold and allowed to set. The fill material is allowed to set and is then abraded or ground such that the fill material forms a substantially flat surface. If the frame is divided into raised and lowered regions, the fill material is typically poured substantially within the lower regions of the base, although some fill material may accumulate atop the raised region. Here, after the fill material has set, the fill material is abraded or ground such that the fill material forms a substantially flat surface that is substantially level with the top surface of the raised region. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The present invention is adaptable for incorporation into cabinets for a variety of devices or display devices. The present invention is particularly useful for implementation by manufacturers of cabinets who attempt to make reasonable efforts to ensure that their cabinets are capable of withstanding a reasonable amount of force to an extremity without tipping over. For example, the present invention is particularly suited for use with cabinets to prevent the cabinets from tipping over due to, e.g., children or animals climbing on or playing around the cabinets. The following discussion, however, focuses on cabinets for PTV sets for exemplary purposes only. In one preferred embodiment, a base having a frame and fill material disposed within the frame is provided. The base preferably conforms to the shape of the enclosure of a cabinet to which it is to be attached, thereby forming the bottom portion of the cabinet. The frame of the base may comprise a sheet metal stamping, metal casting, molded plastic, wood, or the like. The frames preferably conform substantially to the footprint of the enclosure to which the resultant frame, and therefore base, will be attached. Alternatively, the base may be formed with substantially only the fill material, i.e., frameless, by manufacturing a mold that conforms to the footprint of the enclosure and pouring the fill material directly into the mold. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is one embodiment of a PTV cabinet <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> using the present invention. The PTV cabinet <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes an enclosure <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> having a top panel <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, a front panel <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, a rear panel <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, and side panels (not shown) extending between the front <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and rear <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> panels and in further connection with the top panel <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, an enclosure suitable for use with the present invention is not limited to one having a front, rear, and two side panels. Rather, the present invention is capable of use with an enclosure that has any plurality of side panels, such as, e.g., an enclosure shaped like an octagon. Additionally, an enclosure suitable for use with the present invention is not limited to a square or rectangle shaped enclosure but may be any suitable shape, such as, e.g., a trapezoidal shaped enclosure. The base of the present invention is formed such that it preferably conforms to the specific shape of the enclosure to which the base is attached. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The enclosure <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is preferably divided by an internal wall <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> into an upper <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> compartment and a lower <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> compartment. CRTs <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and PWBs <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> are preferably mounted in the lower compartment <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, and a mirror M and a screen S are preferably mounted in the upper compartment <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. At least one projection lens <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> preferably extends from the lower compartment <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> into the upper compartment <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> through the internal wall <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The upper compartment <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is preferably tightly sealed from the lower compartment <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> in order to protect the inside of the upper compartment <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> from dust and other foreign materials that might otherwise be introduced from the lower compartment <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. The enclosure <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is preferably constructed using light weight materials and methods, such as, e.g., molded plastic foam components formed from expanded polystyrene or phenolic that is sandwiched between coatings of an appropriate structural material such as plastic. Appropriate materials and methods to construct an enclosure using light weight materials are further described in copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/643,892 to Lowe entitled &ldquo;Foam Cabinetry for Electronic Devices,&rdquo; which is fully incorporated herein. Alternatively, the top panel <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, front panel <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, rear panel <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, and side panels (not shown) of the enclosure <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be constructed of injection molded plastic, vacuum formed plastic, particle board, other wood-based materials, or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Rather than a bottom panel typical of the prior art, such as, e.g., bottom panel <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of cabinet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the PTV cabinet <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the present invention includes an integrally weighted base <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the base <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> includes a frame <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> and fill material <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> located within the frame <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>. The frame <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> is preferably a stamped sheet metal frame formed using a master mold. The mold is configured in the shape of the desired frame, namely, the mold is configured to produce frames that conform to the footprint of the enclosure to which the base will be attached. To produce a metal frame <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>, a piece of metal, such as, e.g., a sheet of metal, is placed over the mold. Subsequently, a stamping ram is used to press or force the metal into the contours of the mold, thereby forming a stamped metal frame <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> that substantially conforms to the contours of the mold. Since the mold is configured to conform to the footprint of the enclosure, the resultant stamped metal frame <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> also conforms to the footprint of the enclosure. Alternatively, a plastic material may be used to form frame <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> in a manner known in the art. If the frame <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> is formed from metal, the frame <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> further acts as a radiation shield, i.e., a metal frame <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> provides the base <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> with an additional function of being able to reduce the emission of electromagnetic radiation through the lower compartment <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> of the enclosure <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Additionally, when the frame <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> is formed from a non-metallic material, such as, e.g., a plastic material, and concrete is used as the fill material <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>, metallic fibers or particles may be added to the concrete in order to impart some ability to the base <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> to act as a radiation shield. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> After manufacturing the frame <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>, a fill material <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> is poured into the frame <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> in order to provide sufficient weight to a cabinet using the base <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> to satisfy industry standard load bearing tests. In one embodiment, the fill material <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> is a concrete mixture. When concrete is used as the fill material, a fibrous material may be added to the concrete to provide structure within the concrete to increase the tensile properties of the fill material. In another embodiment, the fill material <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> may be a metallic material. In still other embodiments, the fill material <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> may be any other material having a sufficient density such that the resultant weight of the base <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is sufficient to balance the PTV cabinet <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and prevent tip over. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> After the fill material <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> is poured into the frame <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>, the fill material <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> is allowed to harden or set. After setting, the top of the fill material <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> is abraded or ground to substantially the same level as the top of the frame <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>, forming a substantially flat surface. Any suitable process, such as, e.g., mechanical abrasion, chemical abrasion, or mechanical cutting techniques, may be used to abrade the fill material <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>. The base <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is then attached to the enclosure <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> using any suitable technique, including adhesives, brackets, rivets, screws, and the like. The process of setting fill material <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> into the frame <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> is preferably accomplished after the frame <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> has been removed from the mold. It is contemplated, however, that the process of setting fill material <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> into the frame <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> may be accomplished prior to the removal of the frame <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> from the mold. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> As previously discussed, the base of the present invention may be shaped in any configuration that matches the profile or footprint of an enclosure to which the base is to be attached. FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>D illustrate top views of several exemplary embodiments of base <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference> shows a base <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>configured for attachment to an enclosure that is substantially rectangular in shape. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference> shows a base <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>configured for attachment to an enclosure that is substantially pentagonal in shape. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3C and 3D</cross-reference> illustrate bases <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>configured for attachment to enclosures that are irregular in shape.

<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a PTV cabinet <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>i</italic></highlight>) including an enclosure <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>i</italic></highlight>) and another embodiment of the base of the present invention. The PTV cabinet <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>i</italic></highlight>) includes substantially the same components as PTV cabinet <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> previously described and shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Additionally, enclosure <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>i</italic></highlight>) is capable of being constructed in substantially the same manner as enclosure <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> As with PTV cabinet <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, PTV cabinet <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>i</italic></highlight>) replaces a typical bottom panel or region of the prior art with a base <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. Unlike the base <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, base <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> does not include a separate frame. Rather, to manufacture the base <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, fill material <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> is poured directly into a master mold. As with the manufacture of the frame <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> of base <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, the mold used to produce the base <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is configured in the shape of the desired base. Generally, this shape corresponds to the footprint or profile of the enclosure <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>i</italic></highlight>) to which the base <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> will be attached. In one embodiment, the fill material <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> is a concrete mixture. When concrete is used as the fill material <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight>, fibers or fibrous material is added to the concrete to provide structure within the concrete to increase the tensile properties of the fill material <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight>. The addition of fiber to increase the tensile strength of the concrete is particularly important with base <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, as compared to base <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, since base <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> does not include a separate frame to provide additional support to the base <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. To impart some ability to shield radiation to the base <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, the fibers added to the concrete may be metallic in nature or if non-metallic fibers are used to increase tensile strength, separate metallic particles may be added to the fill material <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the fill material <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> may be a metallic material. In still other embodiments, the fill material <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> may be any other material that possesses a density greater than the material used to construct the panels of the enclosure <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>i</italic></highlight>), and therefore a density that results in a weight sufficient to balance the PTV cabinet <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>i</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> After the fill material <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> is poured into the mold, the fill material <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> is allowed to harden or set. In one embodiment, after setting, the top of the fill material <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> is abraded to a substantially level surface. Any suitable process, such as, e.g., mechanical abrasion, chemical abrasion, or mechanical cutting techniques, may be used to abrade the fill material <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight>. The base <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is then attached to the enclosure <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>i</italic></highlight>) using any suitable technique, such as, e.g., screws, adhesives, brackets, or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Turning to now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> PTV cabinet <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> having an enclosure <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and another embodiment of the base, namely, base <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, of the present invention is illustrated. Additionally, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> provides a close-up, side view of the base <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. The PTV cabinet <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> includes substantially the same components and is constructed in substantially the same manner as PTV cabinet <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> previously described and shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. As with PTV cabinet <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, PTV cabinet <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> replaces a typical bottom panel or region of the prior art with a base <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. The base <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> is attached to the front panel <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, the rear panel <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and the side panels (not shown) of the enclosure <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, opposite the top panel <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of the enclosure <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, to form the bottom surface of the PTV cabinet <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The base <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> preferably is divided into at least one raised region or area <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> and at least one lower region <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> adjacent each raised region <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>. The base <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> includes a frame <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> into which fill material <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> is set. The frame <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> is manufactured in substantially the same manner, and is capable of being made using substantially the same materials, as frame <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> previously described and illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Reference is made to the description of frame <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> as that description substantially applies to frame <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the fill material <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> is set in substantially the lower regions <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> of the frame <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight>, although it is to be expected that some fill material <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> may also contact the raised region <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> during this process. After the fill material <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> is poured into the frame <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight>, and preferably substantially into the lower region <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> of the frame <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight>, the fill material <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> is allowed to set or cure. Preferably, once the fill material <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> solidifies, the top surface of the fill material <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> is abraded or ground such that the top surface of the fill material <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> is substantially level with the top surface of the raised region <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>. The abrasion or grinding process is preferably accomplished through mechanically abrasive methods, although chemicals or any of the other abrasion methods described herein may also be used during this process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The base <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> may also include a plurality of openings <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> disposed on the top surface of the raised region <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>. When present, the openings <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> allow for heat radiating from the components of the PTV, such as, e.g., the CRTs <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and the PWBs <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, to dissipate from the lower compartment <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. To further increase heat dissipation from the lower compartment <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, a set of ventilation holes <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> positioned on the rear panel <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is optionally provided. One skilled in the art would understand that the location of the set of ventilation holes <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> may vary depending on the desired heat dissipation effect. In embodiments of the base <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> having a plurality of openings <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight>, any fill material <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> covering the openings <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> is removed from the top surface of the raised region <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> during the abrasion or grinding process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, another embodiment of the base of the present invention, base <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>, is illustrated. Base <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> has a frame <highlight><bold>351</bold></highlight> that further includes a plurality of elevated portions <highlight><bold>353</bold></highlight> disposed within the lower regions <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> of the frame <highlight><bold>351</bold></highlight> in addition to a raised region <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight>. Although two elevated portions <highlight><bold>353</bold></highlight> are illustrated, any multiple number of elevated portions <highlight><bold>353</bold></highlight> may be implemented in base <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>. The elevated portions <highlight><bold>353</bold></highlight> are configured for securably attaching thereto a component of the PTV, such as, e.g., the PWB <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, to the base <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>. Each elevated portion <highlight><bold>353</bold></highlight> may be solid but for an opening (not shown) configured for securably inserting an attachment element, such as, e.g., a screw, therein. In practice, for example, the PWB <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is placed atop the elevated portions <highlight><bold>353</bold></highlight> prior to the coupling of the base <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> to the cabinet, and attachment elements are inserted through the PWB <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and into each opening of each respective portion <highlight><bold>353</bold></highlight>. As a result, the PWB <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is secured to the base <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>. Base <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> is manufactured in substantially the same manner, and is capable of being made using substantially the same materials, as base <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>C illustrate another embodiment of the base of the present invention. Base <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> is formed with a plurality of dimpled areas <highlight><bold>453</bold></highlight> that, when removed during the manufacturing process, leave openings <highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight> through which attachment elements <highlight><bold>456</bold></highlight> may be securably inserted. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</cross-reference> shows base <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> with frame <highlight><bold>451</bold></highlight> having a plurality of raised, dimpled areas <highlight><bold>453</bold></highlight>. The frame <highlight><bold>451</bold></highlight> of base <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> is formed using substantially the same manufacturing process used when forming the frames of the other bases previously described. For example, a process such as that used to form frame <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> of base <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> may be used to form frame <highlight><bold>451</bold></highlight>. Further, the same materials useable to form the other frames of the previously described bases, such as frame <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>, may be used for frame <highlight><bold>451</bold></highlight>. Consequently, reference is made to the description of the materials and process for forming frame <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>, as that description also applies to the materials and process for manufacturing frame <highlight><bold>451</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> After frame <highlight><bold>451</bold></highlight> is formed, a fill material <highlight><bold>458</bold></highlight> is poured into the frame <highlight><bold>451</bold></highlight> and allowed to set or harden. As with the other bases described previously, materials such as concrete, a concrete and fiber mixture, a concrete and metallic mixture if plastic is used to form the frame <highlight><bold>451</bold></highlight>, and a metallic compound are useable as the fill material <highlight><bold>458</bold></highlight>. Once the fill material <highlight><bold>458</bold></highlight> is set, a suitable abrasive or grinding process is used to level the top surface of the fill material <highlight><bold>458</bold></highlight>. Mechanical abrasion or chemical abrasion may be used to perform this function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Additionally, during the abrasion or grinding process, the tops of the dimples <highlight><bold>453</bold></highlight> are removed from the frame <highlight><bold>451</bold></highlight>. As a result of the removal of the tops of the dimples <highlight><bold>453</bold></highlight>, a number of openings <highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight> corresponding to the number of dimples <highlight><bold>453</bold></highlight> removed are formed. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>C, the openings <highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight>, formed after the removal of the tops of the dimples <highlight><bold>453</bold></highlight>, are configured to allow an attachment element <highlight><bold>456</bold></highlight>, which may be, e.g., a screw, to be securably inserted therein. A component of the PTV may be secured to the base <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> by inserting an attachment element <highlight><bold>456</bold></highlight> through the component and subsequently through an opening <highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

Other configurations and shapes of openings <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> are also capable of being implemented on the base <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, or any other of the previously described bases having openings allowing for the venting of excess heat from the interior of a PTV cabinet, of the present invention. One skilled in the art would appreciate that the configurations and shapes of the openings <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> may vary based upon the desired heat dissipation effect, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides for a base <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> divided into a plurality of raised regions. Turning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10, a</cross-reference> base <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> is illustrated that includes frame <highlight><bold>551</bold></highlight> divided into a plurality of raised regions <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight>. Although two raised regions <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight> are shown, it is envisioned that any multiple numbers of raised regions <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight> may be implemented in base <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>. The frame <highlight><bold>551</bold></highlight> of base <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> further includes lower regions <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> adjacent to each raised region <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight>. Fill material <highlight><bold>558</bold></highlight> is poured into the frame <highlight><bold>551</bold></highlight>, and substantially within the lower regions <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight>, allowed to set or harden, and then abraded or ground to substantially the same level as the top surface of the raised regions <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight>. The base <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> also includes a plurality of openings <highlight><bold>556</bold></highlight>, to allow for heat dissipation, on the top surface of the raised regions <highlight><bold>556</bold></highlight>. Any fill material <highlight><bold>558</bold></highlight> that may have accumulated over these openings <highlight><bold>556</bold></highlight> during the pour and set processes are abraded or ground in order to keep the openings <highlight><bold>556</bold></highlight> unobstructed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</cross-reference>, another embodiment, base <highlight><bold>650</bold></highlight>, of the present invention is illustrated. Base <highlight><bold>650</bold></highlight> is similar to base <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, described previously and illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, in that neither base <highlight><bold>650</bold></highlight> nor base <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> has a separate frame into which fill material is poured and allowed to set. Base <highlight><bold>650</bold></highlight> is formed by pouring fill material <highlight><bold>658</bold></highlight> directly into a mold. Additionally, the mold for base <highlight><bold>650</bold></highlight> is configured to form a base <highlight><bold>650</bold></highlight> having a central area <highlight><bold>652</bold></highlight> with a plurality of dimples <highlight><bold>660</bold></highlight> over an open space <highlight><bold>653</bold></highlight>. Once the fill material <highlight><bold>658</bold></highlight> hardens or sets, a suitable abrasive or grinding method is used to smoothen the top surface of the fill material <highlight><bold>658</bold></highlight>. During the abrasion or grinding process, the dimples <highlight><bold>660</bold></highlight> are also removed, thereby leaving a plurality of openings <highlight><bold>656</bold></highlight>. The openings <highlight><bold>656</bold></highlight> allow heat to dissipate from the interior of the cabinet to which the base <highlight><bold>650</bold></highlight> is attached. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</cross-reference> shows a top view of the base <highlight><bold>650</bold></highlight> and the openings <highlight><bold>656</bold></highlight> formed by the removal of the dimples <highlight><bold>660</bold></highlight> during the abrasion process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The bases of the present invention allow a cabinet to be integrally weighted in a manner suitable for satisfying industry standard load tests, such as, e.g., the UL tip over test, without the need for placing additional, individual weights, see, e.g., counterweights <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of cabinet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, inside the cabinet, unlike prior art cabinets. One advantage of the bases of the present invention over the prior art is that the possibility of individual counterweights, such as, e.g., counterweights <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of cabinet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, becoming detached during the manufacture, transport, or life of the cabinet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is eliminated. Consequently, the ability of a cabinet using the present bases to satisfy standardized load bearing tests throughout its lifetime is ensured and maintained. </paragraph>
