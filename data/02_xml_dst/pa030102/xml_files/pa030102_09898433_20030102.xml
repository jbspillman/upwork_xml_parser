<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to an apparatus and a method for testing the property of a fabric and more particularly, relates to an apparatus and a method for testing the air permeability of a fabric by using a quantitative tube filled with a soap solution. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In the recent development of semiconductor fabrication technology, the continuous miniaturization device fabricated demands more astringent requirements in the fabrication environment and contamination control. When the feature size was in the 2 &mgr;m range, a cleanliness class of 100&tilde;1,000 (i.e., the number of particles at sizes larger than 0.5 &mgr;m per cubic foot) was sufficient. However, when the feature size is reduces 0.25 &mgr;m, a cleanliness class of 0.1 becomes necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> It has been proposed that an inert mini-environment may be the solution to future fabrication technologies when the device size is further reduced. In order to eliminate micro-contamination and to reduce native oxide growth on silicon surfaces, the wafer processing and the loading/unloading procedures of a process tool must be enclosed in a extremely high cleanliness mini-environment that is constantly flushed with ultra pure nitrogen that no oxygen or moisture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Different approaches in modern clean room design has been pursued in recent years in the advent of the ULSI technology. One is the utilization of a tunnel concept in which a corridor separates the process area from the service area in order to achieve a high level of air cleanliness. Under the concept, the majority of equipment maintenance functions are conducted in low-classified service areas, while the wafers are handled and processed in more costly high-classified tunnels. For instance, in a process for 16 M and 64 M DRAM products, the requirements of contamination control in a process environment is so stringent that the control of the enclosure of the process environment for each process tool must be considered. In order to maintain the high cleanliness class required, the loading and unloading of the process tool must handled automatically by an input/output device such as a SMIF apparatus. The clothing of the machine operator must also be stringently cleaned without introducing particle contaminations into the clean room. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The continuous monitoring of particles, temperature and humidity conditions inside a clean room is required for alerting engineers to changes occurring in the clean room environment such that steps may be taken to prevent particle-sensitive fabrication processes from drifting out of control. The proper gowning procedure and clean room maintenance practices are both critical to prevent any possible micro-contamination in the clean room. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It has long been recognized that the human operators are major sources of clean room contaminants. For instance, not only the operators generate a large number of contaminants, the operators are also in close proximity to the wafers at many different stages of the fabrication process. As a result, a proper gowning procedure becomes critical in minimizing the exposure of human hair, bare skin and contaminants carried on street clothes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> To minimize human contamination, it has been a practice in IC fabrication facilities to require its clean room operators to change from street clothes and street shoes into company-provided clean room suit, a face mask and booties over the street shoes. These clean room suits, masks and booties are worn on the outside of street clothes of clean room operators in a designated area immediately adjacent to a clean room normally known as a gowning room. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A good clean room suit material is normally made of woven fabrics that consist of long synthetic fibers covered with a layer of low friction polymeric material. The polymeric coating material prevents particles from passing through while at the same time allows vapor transmission. The clean room suits and booties are washed regularly using deionized water and sodium-free detergent. Stringent procedures must be followed in providing laundry services to the suits and booties in order to minimize contamination while washing, packaging, transporting, and storing these clean room garments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A good clean room suit material also requires good breathability or air permeability such that the suit can be worn comfortably by a clean room operator. While the air permeability quality is important, it must be balanced by the possible emission of particles from the human body. For instance, the air permeability must not be so high that the particle counts from a human body increases. The air permeability property of a clean room suit material must therefore be limited by the particle emission property and thus, must be controlled within a suitable range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Traditionally, the air permeability property of a fabric material is tested by a differential pressure technique in which the pressure difference in two chambers that are separated by a piece of fabric are determined. However, such determination requires specialized equipment for pressurizing the chambers and for making sensitive measurements of a pressure change. The test can not be easily conducted in a factory environment and furthermore, the test apparatus cannot be easily mobilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus for testing the air permeability of a fabric that does not have the drawbacks or shortcomings of the conventional methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the present invention to provide an apparatus for testing the air permeability of a fabric which can be easily used in a factory environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> It is a further object of the present invention to provide an apparatus for testing the air permeability of a fabric which can be easily assembled by components that are readily available. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> It is another further object of the present invention to provide an apparatus for testing the air permeability of a fabric by using a flow regulator, a flow meter, a sample holder and a quantitative tube. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> It is still another object of the present invention to provide an apparatus for testing air permeability of a fabric by utilizing a quantitative tube in which a water solution of soap is utilized to generate bubbles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a method for testing air permeability of a fabric by utilizing a simple arrangement of a test apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> It is still another further object of the present invention to provide a method for testing air permeability of a fabric by utilizing a quantitative tube and determining the amount of time for a soap bubble to travel through the tube. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The invention discloses an apparatus for testing the air permeability of a fabric material, the apparatus is particularly suitable for testing the air permeability of a clean room garment material. The apparatus is constructed by a flow regulator, a flow meter, a sample holder and a quantitative tube. The apparatus may further include a shut-off valve situated upstream of the flow regulator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In the system, the flow regulator is used for controlling the flow rate of an air flow through the apparatus, while the flow meter is connected in fluid communication with the flow regulator for indicating an air flow rate. The sample holder is further in fluid communication with the flow meter for holding a fabric sample such that an air flow may pass through the fabric sample to exit an outlet tube. The quantitative tube is equipped with an enlarged portion that is optically transparent in fluid communication with a gas outlet on top of the quantitative tube and a fluid reservoir at a bottom of the quantitative tube. The fluid reservoir is used to hold a quantity of a fluid that generates bubbles when air passes over a top surface of the fluid. The fluid reservoir is connected to the enlarged portion of the quantitative tube by a tube section. The tube section is further in fluid communication with the outlet tube of the sample holder for admitting an air flow that is flown through the fabric sample and for exiting the air flow from the gas outlet on top of the quantitative tube. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The enlarged portion of the quantitative tube is provided with a lower mark and an upper mark at two extreme ends of the enlarged portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The invention further discloses a method for testing air permeability of a clean room garment material by using the aforementioned apparatus. The method is carried out by first flowing an air flow through the flow regulator, the flow meter, the sample holder and a fabric sample that is fastened to the sample holder such that a bubble is generated by the quantity of fluid and rising up through the lower mark and the upper mark of the quantitative tube. The amount of time required for a bubble to pass from the lower mark to the upper mark is then determined as an indication of the air permeability of the fabric material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The present invention apparatus can be easily assembled together with components that are readily available. The components are low cost components, such that the apparatus can be assembled together at very little expense. The apparatus can be used to perform an air permeability test of a clean room garment material to evaluate the breathability or air permeability of the material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The present invention apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for conducting an air permeability test for a fabric material is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is constructed by four major components of a flow regulator <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a flow meter <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, a sample holder <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and a quantitative tube <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The apparatus may optionally include a shut-off valve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> installed upstream of the flow regulator <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The shut-off valve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> admits an air flow or cut-off an air flow <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> into the flow regulator <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which may be suitably a butterfly valve or any other type of flow regulators. The air flow passes through an air conduit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> into a flow meter <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, which may be suitably a gravity ball type such that the air flow rate can be easily read on a graduated scale on the side of the meter. The air flow then passes through air conduit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> into a sample holder <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The sample holder <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> can be advantageously constructed by a hard plastic material, such as PVC. The sample holder <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is constructed by a PVC tube <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> with two hollow end caps <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> fastened to the two ends of the tube. The two hollow end caps <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> may be screwed onto the PVC tube <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, or may be compression fitted to the ends of the tube. The hollow end cap <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> allows an air tight connection with the air conduit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, while the hollow end cap <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> allows an installation of a fabric sample <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the air tight connection to air conduit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the sample holder tube <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is constructed in PVC with a diameter of about <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> cm which produces a cross-sectional area of about 3 cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the PVC tube <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is further provided, i.e., or drilled, with a plurality of ventilation holes <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> such that an air flow <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> through the sample holder <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> can be buffered and does not damage the fabric sample <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in the event that the air flow <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is too high. The ventilation apertures <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may be suitably provided in a diameter between about 1 mm and about 3 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> After the air flow <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> passes through the fabric sample <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> clamped by the end cap <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, it passes through air conduit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> into a quantitative tube <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The quantitative tube <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is most suitably fabricated in a glass material such that the rising up of a bubble can be readily examined visually. The quantitative tube <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is constructed with an enlarged portion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> which is provided with a lower mark <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and an upper mark <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> on the glass wall. The volume in the enlarged portion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> between the two marks <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is approximately 90 cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>. On top of the quantitative tube <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, is connected with a gas outlet <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> which may be filled with sintered glass beads <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to prevent the escape of bubbles from the gas outlet <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, while allowing air to escape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> On the other extreme end of the quantitative tube <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, is connected in fluid communication with the enlarged portion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> a fluid reservoir <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> used to hold a quantity of a fluid <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> for generating bubbles when air is passed over a top surface <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> of the quantity of fluid <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. In the present invention preferred embodiment, a water solution of a soap is suitably used as the quantity of fluid <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> such that soap bubble can be produced to rise up the connecting tube <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> in-between the fluid reservoir <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and the enlarged portion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the quantitative tube <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The connecting tube <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is further provided with a T-shaped connection to the air conduit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> such that an air flow <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> that passes through the fabric sample <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may enter into the quantitative tube <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and carry with it a soap bubble upwardly through the quantitative tube <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that any other suitable bubble-generating fluid may also be used in the present invention fluid reservoir <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> to produce bubbles. As a bubble <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is produced by the air flow <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> through the connecting tube <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> upwardly, the bubble <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> first passes through the lower mark <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> into the enlarged portion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, and then passes through the upper mark <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and is trapped by the sintered glass beads <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> while air escapes through the outlet <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. Since the quantitative tube <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is fabricated of a glass material, the generation of the bubble <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and the traveling of bubble <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> through the enlarged portion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the quantitative tube <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can be easily observed and as a result, the total period of time needed for the bubble <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> to travel between the lower mark <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and the upper mark <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> can be determined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The present invention method for testing air permeability of a clean room garment material can be carried out by first flowing an air flow <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> through the flow regulator <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the flow meter <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the sample holder <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the fabric sample <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> such that a bubble <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is generated from the quantity of fluid <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and rises up through the lower mark <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and the upper mark <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the quantitative tube <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The time required for the bubble <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> to pass from the lower mark <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> to the upper mark <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is thus determined and used to calculate the air permeability by the following equation:</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>Relative Air Permeability&equals;90/(number of seconds of bubbles to rise from lower mark to upper mark)&times;(cross-sectional area of sample tube)</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In the present illustrative example, the enlarged portion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the quantitative tube <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> has a volume of about 90 cm<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>which is used in the equation. When the diameter of the sample holder <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is about 1 cm, which gives a cross-sectional area of about 3 cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, and when the total number of seconds for the bubble to rise passing the lower mark and the upper mark is determined to be about 30 seconds, the relative air permeability determined is about 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> After the determination of several acceptable garment material that have been used in the clean room garments, it was determined that a suitable relative air permeability is between a numerical value of 1 and 3. These numbers represent an acceptable range of the relative air permeability, while the particle count from human body is maintained at an acceptable level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The present invention apparatus and method for testing air permeability of a clean room garment material have therefore been amply described in the above description and in the appended drawing of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> While the present invention has been described in an illustrative manner, it should be understood that the terminology used is intended to be in a nature of words of description rather than of limitation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, while the present invention has been described in terms of a preferred embodiment, it is to be appreciated that those skilled in the art will readily apply these teachings to other possible variations of the inventions. </paragraph>
