<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A testing chamber is configured to evaluate the accuracy of a wireless communication device under test in a production environment. The configuration of the testing chamber may resemble an enclosed structure having a wall that includes multiple layers. An array of antennas, which serves as a layer of the wall, is strategically positioned within the testing chamber to receive and transmit signals emitted to/from the wireless communication device. Located within the testing chamber is either a stationary or moveable holder to support the wireless communication device.

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention generally relates to the field of wireless communications. More particularly, the present invention relates to a system and method that test and evaluate a wireless communication device in a production environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Background Information </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The efficiency and effectiveness of a wireless communication device depend on the performance of its antenna. In designing wireless communication devices, one important factor considered is the antenna&apos;s radiation pattern. During operation, the wireless communication device must be able to effectively communicate with other such devices or a base station, hub or satellite, which may be located in various directions away from the wireless communication device. As a result, it is important that the antennas for such wireless communication devices emit the appropriate radiation pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The radiation patterns of the antenna are also important in relation to government radiation standards promulgated for wireless communication device users. According to government regulations, the radiation patterns must be controlled or adjusted so that users absorb only a minimum amount of radiation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> One type of current testing device that has been used to measure an antenna&apos;s performance is an anechoic chamber. Such anechoic chambers may comprise large testing devices, as described and illustrated in the publication entitled &ldquo;An Analysis of the Balun&rdquo;, written by Bruce A. Eggers and published in April 1980. The large anechoic chamber, commonly referred to as a Free-field room or Free-space room, is a testing laboratory designed having a square or rectangular outer structure surrounding an interior surface, which is completely lined with an absorptive material. The absorptive material serves to mitigate any interference signals or reflections generated during testing within the anechoic chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Since space is often at a premium in a factory, some have opted to reduce the size of the testing chamber, which reduction may result in a reduction in the accuracy of the testing results. U. S. Pat. No. 5,805,667, granted to Alvarez et al. on Sep. 8, 1998, discloses such a testing device. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In accordance with one embodiment, a testing chamber is provided to house a wireless communication device under testing. An array of antennas is attached to the inner surface of the testing chamber. The arrangement of the array of antennas is configured so that the arrangement receives signals emitted from the wireless communication device and transmits signals to the wireless communication device. During testing, the wireless communication device is placed and retained within a holder located within the testing chamber. A computer connects to the testing chamber for measuring the characteristics of the signals transmitted to and from the wireless communication device. The computer also shapes the beam of the transmit signals emitted from the arrangement of the array of antennas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A specific embodiment may be provided with features allowing it to offer several different modes of testing the device. For instance, a quick and simple go and no-go test may be permitted. Alternatively, a beam sweeping mode may be activated. During the beam sweeping mode, the device automatically sweeps the circumference of the testing chamber and sequentially activates each antenna individually so as to create a beam sweeping effect within the testing chamber. Additionally, the wireless communication device may be tested under an integrated mode, which simultaneously activates all of the antennas of the antenna array arrangement. During the integrated mode, all of the antennas of the antenna array radiate simultaneously towards the wireless communication device and excite the wireless communication device from all directions and angles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The configuration of the testing chamber may resemble various shapes. For example, in one embodiment, the testing chamber resembles a sphere. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The holder, which retains the wireless communication device during testing, may be either a stationary device or a movable positioner that moves horizontally, vertically or both. According to one embodiment, as the movable positioner rotates and moves the wireless communication device, the computer connected to the testing chamber determines the accuracy and performance of the wireless communication device by averaging the magnitude of the RF waves transmitted along the forward and reverse communication links. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> If multi-path propagations develop during testing, the invention may employ several novel features to compensate for the deleterious effects of multi-path propagations. For example, the computer may automatically shape and contour the beam emitted from the array of antennas by adjusting the phase and amplitude of one or more of the antennas. Furthermore, using the movable positoner, the position of the wireless communication device may also be varied to relocate the device away from an interior wall of the testing chamber in order to offset the effects of multi-path propagation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the invention enables the array of antennas, which line the wall of the testing chamber, to detect the gain in a particular direction or perform &ldquo;antenna pattern&rdquo; measurements of the wireless communication device under testing. The antennas of the array of antennas may be activated selectively, sequentially, or simultaneously. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A system and method, and parts thereof, are provided to facilitate the testing of wireless communication devices. In the embodiments illustrated herein, the device being tested is a wireless telephone. However, the testing apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be used to perform testing and analysis of virtually all wireless communication devices, and it is not limited only to wireless telephones. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows one embodiment of the testing apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> for testing the transmit/receive performance of a wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The testing apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> comprises a wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, a testing chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and a data processing device, such as shown by computer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. To assist in the understanding of the present invention, a brief description of a typical wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> will be provided. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates a conventional wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. An antenna <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is coupled to a transmitter (not shown) and a receiver (not shown). The transmitter (not shown) and receiver (not shown) may share some circuit components and be considered a transceiver. The transmitter and receiver operate at frequencies that are assigned for various types of wireless communication devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> A typical wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, such as a handheld cellular telephone, also includes a central processing unit (CPU) (not shown), which may be an embedded controller or conventional microprocessor. In addition, the wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> includes a memory, which may include both random access memory (RAM) and read-only memory (ROM). A keypad may be included to permit the user to operate and control the wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. A microphone and a speaker may provide audio input and output, respectively. A display may provide the user with information regarding the operation of the wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The operation of such conventional wireless communication devices are well known in the art and thus will only be described in the context of the present embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the testing chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is a testing device enclosed by wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and containing a holder <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> attached thereto. The configuration of the testing chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may resemble various configurations, while the testing chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> still maintains its capabilities to implement the invention. However, the embodiments, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 8</cross-reference>, illustrate the shape of the testing chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as being substantially spherical. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The spherical shape of this embodiment serves to mitigate the disadvantages associated with the rectangular configuration of most conventional wireless communication testing devices. Typically, using a rectangular or box structure means that the device under testing may be located closer to some inner walls than others. The proximity of the device to the inner wall determines the amount of multipath propagation generated within the testing chamber. If the device is located closer to the wall, more multipath fading will be generated. During testing, the signals transmitted to and from the device under testing will impinge the interior of the chamber and create multiple versions of the original signal, i.e., reflections, that arrive at the receiving element of the antenna of the device under test. Because the same signal arrives at the device under test over several paths, each with a different electrical length, the phases of each path will be different, resulting in multipath fading, signal distortion or both. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The absorptive material, which typically lines the interior of most rectangular or box-shaped chambers, serves to lessen the effects of interference signals generated by the multiple versions of the original signal. Nevertheless, the absorptive material works best when the waves of the signal arrive at the device under test from a 90&deg; angle of incidence. The rectangular or box-shaped testing chamber typically provides an incident angle of a wave front other than 90&deg;, which reduces the effectiveness of the absorptive material. Inherently, a spherical-shaped testing chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of this embodiment provides the maximum amount of attenuation of reflected waves, and does so using standard absorbing material common in today&apos;s industry. The spherical-shaped chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> thus provides a substantially normal (perpendicular) orientation between its wall and any radiating object under test disposed therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates a more detailed depiction of the composition of the wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the testing chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to this embodiment. The wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes an array of antennas <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, an absorbing material <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and an outside layer <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. At least one antenna <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, preferably an array of antennas <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of an antenna system <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, lines the inner wall of the testing chamber as an inner layer. The antennas of an antenna array arrangement <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are strategically positioned within the inner wall of the testing chambers to receive signals emitted from the wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The antenna array arrangement <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> also transmits signals to the wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The antenna array arrangement <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> may completely cover the inner wall or may cover only segments of the inner wall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference> illustrate exemplary embodiments of the antenna array arrangement <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> that may be employed in the invention to provide a source of radio frequency energy within the testing chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows an example of magnetic dipole antennas <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows an example of a dipole antennas that include a Balun, which feeds a balanced antenna. A Balun is a device that joins a balanced line (one that has two conductors, with equal currents flowing in opposite direction, such as a twisted pair cable) to an unbalanced line (one that has just one conductor and a ground, such as a coaxial cable). A Balun is a type of transformer used to convert an unbalanced signal to a balanced signal or vice versa. Baluns isolate a transmission line and provide balanced output. A typical use for a Balun is in a television antenna, i.e.&mdash;a rabbit ear antenna. Similarly, dipole antennas with Baluns, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, function as TV rabbit ears that may be adjusted to a particular angle. Likewise, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the angle of the dipole antennas has been adjusted to be approximately 180 degrees. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The dipole antennas of either <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> or <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> may constitute a receive only antenna, a transmit only antenna or a receive and transmit antenna, i.e., a transceiver. The exemplary dipole antennas may be oriented horizontally, vertically, or at a slant. The polarization of the RF signal radiated by a dipole transmitting antenna corresponds to the orientation of the element. Thus, the orientation of the antennas <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> may be controlled and adjusted by computer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> as needed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In the embodiments shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, the spherical testing chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes an array of antennas <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> distributed around the entire inner surface of the testing chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, as shown in the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the shape of the antenna array arrangement <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> may be configured to cover only a portion of the testing chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. For example, the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> illustrates that the antennas <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the antenna system <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be designed to form a ring along the inner wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the testing chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The ring configuration of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> or other alternative designs may be constructed by strategically positioning and/or attaching the antennas <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the antenna system <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> inside the testing chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to form such a configuration. Alternatively, such configurations may be formed in the embodiment where the antennas completely cover the inner surface wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by selectively activating particular antennas <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> to form such a configuration. The testing apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be designed so that the shapes of different configurations may be automatically programmable or preprogrammed into the computer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The quantity and the alignment of the antennas <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the antenna system <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, lined within the inner layer of the wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, depend upon the testing conditions established by each user. The geometry of the testing chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the degree of precision desired may also be a factor in determining the selection of the configuration of the antenna <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> arrangement. For instance, if a user desires an azimuthal granularity that is capable of testing every <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> angular degrees within a spherical-shaped testing chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the size of the spherical-shaped testing chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will determine the number of antennas needed to cover the 360 degrees circumference of the sphere. Obviously within this hypothetical, a large testing chamber would require more antennas than a smaller testing chamber. Other factors that may influence the configuration of the antenna array arrangement <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are the operating frequencies of the wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the antenna system <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. In other words, the configuration of the antenna array arrangement depends upon the user&apos;s test requirements and conditions. One skilled in the art would recognize that various embodiments of the invention may be configured without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> A more detailed description of the operation of the antenna array arrangement <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> will be provided below in reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and to the description of the operation of the embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> further illustrates that an absorptive material <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may serve as a middle layer of the wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to absorb and reduce the amount of internal signal interferences or reflections generated within the testing chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> during testing. The absorptive material <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> absorbs the RF waves generated in the testing chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by converting the energy of the waves into heat that is absorbed into the absorptive material <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, instead of being reflected outwardly into the testing chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The absorptive material <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may, for example, include a layer of styrofoam covered with absorbing paint. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, according to this embodiment, the outside layer of the testing chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may include an outer wall <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. The outer wall <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> may be any material that excludes external signal interferences by physically isolating the testing chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from the surrounding environment. However, in the preferred embodiment, the outer wall <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is a metal skin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Referring to the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the holder <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> located in the testing chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> supports and retains the wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> during testing. The holder <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> may be either stationary or mobile. A stationary holder <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> may attach to the testing chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by a mechanical attaching mechanism (not shown). In an alternative embodiment, the holder <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> containing the wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> may sit within a mobile positioner <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>), which varies the position of the wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> horizontally, vertically or both during testing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates an exemplary embodiment of a mobile positioner <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, but other structures known to one of ordinary skill in the art may also be employed. The positioner <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> may include a linkage mechanism <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, which connects to a rotating disk <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> connected to the testing chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and operated by the computer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The linkage mechanism <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> may be moved horizontally, vertically or simultaneously in both directions in order to vary the horizontal, as well as the azimuthal plane of the wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Namely, the movement of the linkage mechanism <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> may resemble, for example, the extension and retraction of the arms of a merry-go-round. The positioner <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> may also be designed to hold multiple wireless communication devices <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Referring once again to the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the computer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> connects to the testing chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to control the testing operations of the testing apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The computer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> includes typical components, such as a central processing unit (CPU) and a memory. A user interface <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> is also coupled to the computer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The user interface <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> typically includes a display and a user input device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The computer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> may also communicate directly with the wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> using a cable coupled between the computer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and the keypad connection for initiating the operations of the wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The computer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> may also send commands to the wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to control its transmitter, receiver, and control circuitry during testing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> With the various embodiments of the system components having been briefly described, the different embodiments of the design and operation of the testing apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> will now be described in greater detail. In order to determine the accuracy and efficiency of the radiated performance of the transmit elements of the antenna <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, one embodiment of the invention provides a simulation model that predicts characteristics of the signals, such as the average received signal strength emitted at a given distance from the transmitter of the antenna <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Alternatively or conjunctively, another embodiment determines the variability of the signal strength of the beam emitted from the antenna in close spatial proximity to a particular location. To assess such characteristics of the signals emitted to and from the antenna <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the testing apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> detects and measures the magnitude of the RF waves propagated by the transmitter of the antenna <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the magnitude of the RF waves reflected off the interior surface of the testing chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> during operation. After measuring the RF waves, the testing apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may average the sum of the RF waves to determine the average of the magnitude of the RF waves received signal strength emitted at a given distance from the transmitter of the antenna <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates the testing chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> during testing according to one embodiment of the present invention. The testing chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> houses the wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. During operation, the signals transmitted from the wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are detected by the antenna of the antenna array arrangement <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, which arrangement is mounted on and serves as the inner layer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the testing chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the antenna array arrangement <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> may constitute an antenna system <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> depicts a representative embodiment of the antenna system <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> comprising an exemplary embodiment of the antenna array arrangement <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, which functions as the inner layer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and couples to a transform matrix <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the configuration of the antenna arrangement <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and the transform matrix <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> permit either transmit or receive operations. The transform matrix <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> comprises a plurality of beam ports on a beam-plane side of the matrix <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and a plurality of antenna ports of the antenna-plane side of the matrix. Each column array of the multi-columnar antenna array arrangement <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> couples through the matrix <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> to the beam ports. During transmission of the antenna system <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, this configuration enables the transform matrix <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> to receive signals, which include relative amplitude and phase information, from the beam-plane ports. Based on this information, the matrix <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> transforms the beam-plane signals into signals appropriate for the radiating antenna elements and delivers such signals to all the antenna ports. Then, the antenna elements within the multi-column antenna array arrangement <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> radiate a narrow beam patterns in different directions in accordance with the transformed signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Conversely, during the antenna system <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> reception, the transform matrix <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> receives signals from the antenna-plane ports and transforms them into signals appropriate for processing. As such, the illustrated antenna system <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> forms a plurality of narrow beam patterns that span outwardly into different angular directions for a given axis. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, each beam port associates with respective beam patterns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> further illustrates that each of the beam ports on the beam-plane side of the transform matrix <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> couples to an amplitude or gain adjusting element <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and a phase adjusting element <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. Elements <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> allow for amplitude/gain and phase adjustments to be made in order to control the shape of the antenna beam patterns, as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates a typical composite beam pattern radiated by the antenna system <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The transform matrix <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> supplies signals to the four individual antenna ports which enables the antenna elements to form four individual beams. The aggregate effect of these individual beams forms the envelope composite beam, as indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. As stated above, the amplitude/gain adjusting elements <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and phase adjusting elements <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> make it possible to control the shape of the antenna beam patterns. The amplitude level at which the individual beams (i.e., sub-beams) intersect is called the cross-over level. The position of the cross-over level depends, at least in part, on the optimal separation distance of the antenna elements contained in the antenna array arrangement <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The signal received by the antennas <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> may be carried outside of the testing chamber to computer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and other recording equipment via a coaxial feed line or other known forms of remote communications. In addition, the computer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> controls the selection of the transmitter&apos;s operating parameters, such as the carrier frequency and the output power of the transmitter of the antenna array arrangement <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Similarly, the computer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> receives data in the form of a receiver output signal generated by the receive element in response to RF signals received from the wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> during testing. Furthermore, the computer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> controls the selection of the receiver operating parameters, such as the carrier frequency and the gain of the receive elements of the antenna array arrangement <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> To test a wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, initially, such a device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> may be placed on the holder <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> inside the testing chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and activated either manually by a user or automatically by the computer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. Next, the user may establish the operating parameters, i.e.&mdash;the carrier frequency and the transmitted power output, of the transmit elements of the antenna array arrangement <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the antenna system <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> by prompting the computer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to activate a single antenna transmit element <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> or a plurality of antenna transmit elements <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the antenna system <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Using the computer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, the transmit elements of the antenna array arrangement <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> may be programmed to selectively or simultaneously vary several operating parameters of the antennas of the antenna array arrangement <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. For example, the phase and the amplitude of each antenna may be varied to transmit at a different frequency, a different angle and/or a different time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> To test the forward communication link, from the antenna system <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to the wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the computer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> instructs the antenna system <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to send RF signals along the transmission link (Tx) through a splitter, which divides the RF signal among the activated transmit elements, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The divided RF signals travel through the phase adjusting element <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and the amplitude or gain adjusting elements <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and enters the transform matrix <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. The transform matrix <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> receives the signal, which includes the relative amplitude and phase information, from the beam-plane ports. Based on this information, the transform matrix <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> transforms the beam-plane signals into signals appropriate for radiating antenna elements and delivers such signals to all of the activated antenna ports. The transform matrix supplies the RF signals to the antenna ports of the activated transmit elements and enables the antenna elements to form individual beams, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The transmit elements of the antenna array arrangement <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> emits the RF signals, which are detected by the receiver of the wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The control circuitry of the wireless communication device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> converts the received signal into signals appropriate for processing by the computer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, which also connects to the wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The computer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> determines the magnitude and other characteristics of the signal received at the wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to assess the accuracy of the wireless communication device along the reverse communication link. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> When testing the radiated performance of wireless communication device along the reverse communication link, from the wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to the antenna system <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the computer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> instructs the wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to send a signal along its transmission link to the antenna system <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The computer device <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> may establish the initial operating parameters, i.e.&mdash;the frequency and the transmit power for the transmitter, of the wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Similarly, as discussed above, the phase and amplitude of the wireless communication device may be varied. The receive elements of the antenna system <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> intercepts the RF signals sent from the wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The transform matrix <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> receives the signals from the antenna-ports and transforms them into signals appropriate for processing by the computer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The combiner combines the received signals and transmits them to the computer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. Then, the computer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> determines the magnitude and other characteristics of the signals received at the antenna system <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to assess the accuracy and efficiency of the wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> along the reverse communication link. The computer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> averages the total energy of the received signals detected by the antenna system <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to quantify how much energy the wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> radiates in all directions. The computer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> may also be employed to measure other characteristics of the wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Different operating embodiments of the invention offer different techniques to analyze the transmission characteristics of the signal emitted from the antenna <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and to test other parameters of the wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. For instance, according to one embodiment, if the user wants to simply determine if the antenna <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is properly connected to other components of the wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> may be inserted into the testing chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to perform a simple go and no-go test, which determines whether the wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> operates properly if the radiated performance merely exceeds a specific limit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment of the invention permits the user to program the computer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to automatically scan the circumference of the testing chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and sequentially activate each antenna individually so that a beam sweeping effect is generated within the testing chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In this sweeping mode, each antenna of the antenna array arrangement <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> may be individually activated and the phase and amplitude of the radiated beam may be adjusted to shape and contour the pattern of the beam in order to minimize the amount of reflections generated within the testing chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The adjustment of the antenna array arrangement <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> may be performed at either the antenna plane or the beam plane, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. In the sweeping mode as the radio frequency signals propagate between the antenna system <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the antenna <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Data points from each antenna <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> will be measured and stored by the computer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> as each antenna <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is sequentially activated and adjusted. The computer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> attempts to quantify the pattern shape of each individual antenna beam. The sweeping mode enables the testing apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to collect data points from different view angles while the wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> remains stationary at the center of the testing chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Alternatively or in conjunction with the sweeping mode, another embodiment permits the position of the wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to be varied using the positioner <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>) so that various data points may be collected from various positions within the testing chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In order to quantify the radiated performance of the antenna system <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the wireless communication device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, at least one or more antennas of the antenna array arrangement <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> may be activated and directed towards the wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, as the device under testing is physically moved by the positioner <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> in different orientations in order to capture and measure the overall effect of the radiated antenna from different angles. As previously mentioned, the positioner <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> may also be designed to hold multiple wireless communication devices <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. In such an embodiment, the user may manually or automatically selectively activate the wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> desired to be tested. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> An alternative or conjunctive embodiment to varying the positioner <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> is to simply spin or rotate the wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> within the positioner <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> A further testing embodiment enables the transmit elements of the antenna array arrangement <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> to be programmed to implement an integrated mode, which simultaneously activates all of the antennas of the antenna array arrangement <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The integrated mode integrates all of the energy that the wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> radiates outwardly towards the antenna system <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Along the forward communication link in the integrated mode, all antennas <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> radiate simultaneously towards the wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and excite the wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> from all directions and angles. The wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> responds along the reverse communication link and radiates its signal outwardly in all directions toward all of the antennas <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the antenna system <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In other words, in the integrated mode, the testing apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> calculates an integrated performance of the wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> because the transmission of the wireless communication radiates its beam over the entire surface area of the testing chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, in integrated mode, all of the antennas of the antenna array arrangement <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are simultaneously excited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Rather than varying the position of the wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the integrated mode enables the user to perform a quick and rudimentary test of the wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Instead of quantifying the pattern shape of an individual antenna beam and gathering data points from each individual antenna as performed in the sweeping mode, the integrated mode may merely determine the total sum of the RF signals radiated by the wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> towards the antenna array arrangement <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the antenna system <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The receive elements of all of the antennas of the antenna array arrangement <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are electronically connected to capture all of the RF signals generated from the wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, and the computer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> determines the power of the total sum of the received RF signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Since the testing chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the invention is small in physical size both transmissions of the wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the antenna array arrangement <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> may be in close proximity to the wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the testing chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Consequently, multi-path propagation, i.e.,&mdash;multi-path fading and scattering, may be generated when a signal transmitted along either the forward or reverse communication link impinges the wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Various embodiments of the invention are also capable of averaging out the adverse effects of multi-path propagation in both the forward and reverse communication links. As previously discussed, multi-path propagations are the reflections generated when the signal impinges the interior wall of the testing chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and bounces off the interior wall creating multiple versions of the original signal and impinges either antenna <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. When the original signal and the multiple versions reach a receiving element of an antenna within the testing chamber, the energy of each signal may be displaced with respect to one another in time and spatial orientation. The random phase and amplitudes of the different multi-path components cause fluctuations in signal strength, thereby inducing fading, signal distortion or both. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> For example, if multiple versions of a sine wave are created within the testing chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, if the generation of the multiple reflections continues to accumulate, at some point, the additive effect of the multiple reflections may skew the test results to indicate that the wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> radiated twice as much power or voltage as actually transmitted by the wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, the subtractive effect of the sine wave may cause the original and reflection waves to perfectly subtract from each other, which may completely cancel each out. Thus, the magnitude of the reflected waves will have a zero summation, which indicates that the wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> does not radiate any energy. This is the worst possible test case. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Fortunately, several embodiments of the invention also serve to combat the deleterious effect of multi-path propagation. One embodiment, which may be initiated during the sweeping mode when each antenna <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is individually and sequentially activated, is beam contouring of the antenna pattern. By activating and adjusting the parameters of the antennas that are adjacent to and/or nearby the activated antenna to assist in shaping or contouring the beam of the activated antenna, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, this embodiment may mitigate detected multi-path propagations. Activation of the adjacent and/or nearby antennas allows the testing apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to shape more precisely the beam of the activated antenna in order to sufficiently minimize the reflections generated in the testing chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The amplitude/gain adjusting elements <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and the phase adjusting elements <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> may be used to shape the beam radiated from the antenna. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Utilization of the beam shaping technique is not limited to the sweeping mode. The testing apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may employ the beam shaping technique whenever adjustments are necessary to compensate for multi-path propagations or other adverse conditions that may develop within the testing chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment of the invention that mitigates multi-path propagation is the positioner. Because the geometry of the testing chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the invention is relatively compact or small when the wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is located within the testing chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> itself or portions of the device may be positioned closer to the wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. As previously discussed, the proximity of a wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to the walls <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of a testing chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> corresponds directly to the amount of multi-path propagation generated during testing. Alternatively or in conjunction with the employment of the beam shaping technique and/or the sweeping mode, the positioner may be used to relocate the wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> away from a particular segment of the wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Varying the position of the wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> away from the wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> lessens the amount of reflections created within the testing chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and enables the testing apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to better test the wireless communication device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> from various angles. </paragraph>
