<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The following disclosure relates generally to accessing supplier information, and more particularly, to computer-implemented methods and systems for providing information about suppliers of engineering services. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Large engineering enterprises and other companies often turn to outside suppliers for engineering services or for manufacturing of parts and assemblies. The use of outside suppliers allows these companies to offload work that they may lack the capacity or expertise to perform in-house. The ability to offload work to competent and reliable suppliers has become increasingly important as companies continually strive to streamline their operations and become more efficient. Today, however, competent and reliable suppliers are spread all over the globe and are no longer clustered around the traditional centers of North America and Europe. Although a global supplier network may increase the availability and help to lower the cost of these services, it can also introduce problems for companies trying to select a supplier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In many companies, current supplier information is often held only by those persons who most recently procured the services of the respective supplier, and this information is usually not disseminated company wide. Similarly, while various business groups within a company may maintain their own &ldquo;unofficial&rdquo; databases of supplier information, this information is usually not shared across other business groups. As a result, accurate, up-to-date supplier information is often not accessible. Even when such information is available, it is often difficult or impossible to determine the type of work that has been placed with the supplier, or the supplier&apos;s qualifications or ratings with respect to the work. This lack of important supplier information often means that actual supplier qualifications are not known until after the supplier has been selected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Conventional databases of supplier information, such as paper catalogues, also have a number of drawbacks. In addition to often not being up-to-date or comprehensive, such databases are frequently not readily accessible by dispersed business groups. Further, when a supplier has performed work of a sensitive nature, information related to that supplier&apos;s performance is often not included in such conventional databases for fear that sensitive information may become public. As a result of the shortcomings associated with conventional supplier information systems, work is often placed with suppliers who lack the skills or resources necessary to provide quality products or meet cost and schedule goals. In light of these shortcomings, methods and systems for providing comprehensive, accurate, and up-to-date supplier information would be desirable.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Methods and systems are described for providing comprehensive, accurate and up-to-date supplier information for a global supplier network. In one embodiment, the method is implemented on a general-purpose computer, such as a personal computer, by a user who accesses a web page from a supplier search web site. The user can search for a supplier by selecting a desired skill or region from drop-down lists provided on the web page. After a skill or region has been selected, another web page is displayed providing a list of suppliers who meet the selected criteria. For example, if a skill has been selected, then a list of suppliers possessing that skill is provided on the web page. If, instead, a region was selected, then a list of suppliers located within that region is provided. By selecting the name of one of the listed suppliers, the user can automatically retrieve another web page displaying detailed information about the respective supplier. In addition to supplier contact information, details regarding the type of work the supplier has performed, the quality of the work the supplier has performed, and the names of individuals within the user&apos;s company who have worked with the particular supplier in the past can be included. These individuals, or &ldquo;company contacts,&rdquo; may then be contacted by the user to obtain further details regarding the supplier of interest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, a user desiring to select a supplier accesses a web page containing a map of the world. The user searches for a supplier by moving a pointer (e.g., arrow) over selected regions on the map. As the cursor moves over a selected region, such as Western Europe, a pop-up list containing suppliers located in that region is displayed. The user may then select one of the suppliers in the pop-up list to obtain detailed information about that supplier as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In yet another embodiment, a user can search for a supplier by accessing a web page containing an &ldquo;advanced search&rdquo; icon. By selecting this icon, the user retrieves an advanced search web page that enables the user to search for a supplier by selecting one or more countries and/or one or more skills. Selecting one or more countries and one or more skills on the advanced search web page brings up another web page containing a list of suppliers who can provide the selected skills and who are located in the selected countries. Selecting the name of one of the suppliers will then bring up detailed information about that supplier as explained above with respect to the other embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the database of supplier information is created and maintained by users who enter selected supplier information via data entry pages, such as data entry web pages. In this embodiment, users who have availed themselves of a supplier for a given project will access a data entry web page and enter selected data regarding the project and the supplier&apos;s performance on that project. This data is then transmitted to a server computer and entered in database structures in accordance with a database schema described below. Entry of supplier data in this manner helps to assure that information regarding supplier technical skills and qualifications is kept up-to-date and accurate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Certain embodiments of supplier search methods and systems are described in the context of computer-executable instructions performed by a general-purpose computer, such as a personal computer. For example, in one embodiment, these computer-executable instructions are stored on a computer-readable medium, such as a floppy disk or CD-ROM. In other embodiments, these instructions are stored on a server computer system and accessed via an Intranet computer network or the Internet. Because the basic structures and functions related to computer-executable routines and corresponding computer implementation systems are well known, they have not been shown or described in detail here to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the described embodiments. Although the following disclosure provides specific details for a thorough understanding of several embodiments of the methods and systems described, one of ordinary skill in the relevant art will understand that these embodiments can be practiced without some of the details. In other instances, it will be understood that the methods and systems disclosed can include additional details without departing from the spirit or scope of the described embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Although some embodiments are described in the context of selecting a supplier for engineering services, such as analytical services, it will be understood that the methods and systems disclosed are usable for much broader supplier selection applications, and accordingly, can be used to select a supplier for other types of goods and services. For example, the methods and systems disclosed can also be used to select a supplier for manufacturing services. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a diagram illustrating a display description <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> for searching for a supplier in a global database in accordance with an embodiment. In one aspect of this embodiment, the display description <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can be a web page presented on a display of a general-purpose user computer, such as a typical personal computer. In one embodiment, the display description <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> represents a main search web page that includes text, background graphics and other features common to other web pages associated with the methods and systems described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The display description <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> contains user interfaces for a skill search tool <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, a region search tool <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, an advanced search tool <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and a global rollover search tool <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The display description <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> also includes various informational links <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> that can be selected by the user to obtain other information or tools related to supplier searches. For example, selection of an overview button will link the user to a general description of the supplier search methods and systems. Selection of a statement of work button can link the user to a statement of work form that can be filled out by the user to procure a service from a selected supplier. In other embodiments, other informational links can be included. The display description <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> also includes one or more news fields <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> containing news items of interest that relate to supplier selection. Selecting one of the news titles will cause the selected article to be displayed. As will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art, a main search web page, such as the display description <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, can contain various other informational aspects related to a supplier search without departing from the spirit or scope of the present disclosure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> To search for a supplier using the region search tool <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, the user selects the tool causing a region drop-down list <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> to be displayed. As shown, the drop-down list <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> contains selected regions of the world. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, the drop-down list <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> includes Central Eastern Europe and Russia <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>; India and Asia; Mexico and South America; North America; and Western Europe. In alternate embodiments, the drop-down list <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> may contain other selected regions of greater or less breadth than those illustrated. Selecting one of the regions in the drop-down list <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, such as the Central Eastern Europe and Russia region <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, causes another display description to be displayed containing a list of suppliers in that region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a diagram illustrating a display description <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> containing a supplier list <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> for a selected region in accordance with an embodiment. The display description <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> includes a region identifier <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> that identifies the region in which the listed suppliers reside. For example, the region identifier <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> of the illustrated embodiment indicates that the listed suppliers all reside in Central Eastern Europe and Russia. As will be described in greater detail below, the user can select the name of one of the listed suppliers to obtain detailed information regarding that supplier. Selection of a back button <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> at any time causes the preceding display description, for example, the main search web page <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, to be re-displayed. In addition to the foregoing functional aspects of the display description <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, it will be noted that this display description also contains many of the informational and graphic aspects included on the main search web page <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a diagram illustrating a display description <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> for searching for a supplier using the global rollover search tool <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> in accordance with an embodiment. In one aspect of this embodiment, the display description <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is at least substantially similar to the main search web page <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In the illustrated embodiment, however, the user has positioned an arrow or other pointer over a Central Eastern Europe and Russia region <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> of the global rollover search tool <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. As a result, a pop-up list <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> is displayed containing suppliers located within that region. It will be noted that the pop-up list <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> contains the same suppliers who were included in the supplier list <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, which was accordingly displayed after the user selected the Central Eastern Europe and Russia region <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> in the region drop-down list <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Thus, suppliers located within a particular region can be found using at least two different methods in accordance with the present disclosure: 1) by selecting the desired region using the region search tool <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> or 2) by &ldquo;rolling over&rdquo; the desired region with a pointing device using the rollover search tool <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. In another embodiment, after a selected skill has been chosen using the skill search tool <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the suppliers displayed in the pop-up list <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> will be only those suppliers in the selected region who have the selected skill. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a diagram illustrating a display description <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> for searching for a supplier using the skill search tool <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in accordance with an embodiment. The search method illustrated by the display description <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> can be implemented when the user desires to select a supplier based solely on skill and not on the region where the supplier is located. In one aspect of this embodiment, the display description <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is at least substantially similar to the main search web page <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In the illustrated embodiment, however, the skill search tool <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> has been selected causing a skill drop-down list <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> to be displayed. The skill drop-down list <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> includes skills such as analysis <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight>, automation, component test, design, drafting and materials test. In other embodiments, more or fewer skills and technical skills other than those listed can be included in the skill drop-down list <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> depending on the industry. Selecting one of the listed skills, such as analysis <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight>, causes a display description to be displayed containing suppliers capable of providing analytical services. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a diagram illustrating a display description <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> containing a supplier list <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> for a selected skill in accordance with an embodiment. The display description <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> includes a skill identifier <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> that identifies the skill which the listed suppliers are capable of providing. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, the listed suppliers are capable of providing services requiring analytical skills.
