<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 4</cross-reference> show the position of the marker light module or modules <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention as mounted on the front fender <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of a conventional motor vehicle hood and fender assembly. The composite light assembly <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is incorporated in a substantial length of the corner <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> formed by the top <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the fender <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the outermost upright face or skirt <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the fender <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Fender <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> projects outward from the raised hood structure <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and overlies a wheel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment shown, the top <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the fender <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> consists of a one-third section of a cylinder, approximately 120&deg; in extent, attached at its inner edge to the longitudinal upright surface of the hood <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> by any conventional means. It will be readily apparent to anyone skilled in the art that the top <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the fender <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be formed of a wide variety of surfaces, including greater or lesser sections of cylinders and compound curved surfaces. An outermost upright face or skirt <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> that includes an opening for the wheel of the vehicle is attached or formed at the outermost edge of the top <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the fender <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Together, the skirt <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the top <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the fender <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> form a corner <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, which may be rounded but typically is abrupt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the light assembly <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is positioned along a substantial length of the corner <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment shown, the light assembly <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> completes approximately a quarter circle arc, i.e., at least about 90&deg;, with the mid-point of the light assembly <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> near the highest point of the corner <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. In alternate embodiments the light assembly <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be positioned at any point along the corner <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the fender <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, although it is preferred that the light assembly <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> be positioned so that at least some portion of it extends both forward and rearward from the highest point of the corner <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, in the illustrated embodiment, the corner <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has an elongated recess <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> where the light assembly <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is located. The recess <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> has a generally horizontal extending shoulder <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and a generally upright surface <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The recess <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> can be formed into the corner <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> during manufacture of the fender <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, such as by molding as in the case of fiberglass fenders or stamping in the case of sheet metal fenders. The light assembly <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is fixed into the recess <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> by any conventional means, such as bolts, rivets, snap fittings, or adhesive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment shown the light assembly <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> consists of three modules <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, each of which may be separately attached to and removed from the fender <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Each module <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a base <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, shaped complementary to the corner recess <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. A plurality of light sources <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, conventionally wired, are carried by the base, and the assembly is closed by a translucent cover or lens <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the light assembly <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can also consist of a single module, or two modules, or that base <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of each module <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be omitted and the light sources <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and covers <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> mounted directly to the fender <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Nevertheless, an integrated base, light and lens structure is preferred. In the illustrated embodiment, the light sources <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are electric light bulbs. The light sources <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are wired to the vehicle&apos;s electrical system and controlled and used in the same manner as any conventional side marker light or turn signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment shown each cover <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is shaped to form a smooth continuation of the top <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and skirt <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The covers <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are translucent and preferably incorporate reflect reflectors for increased visibility. The light sources <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may provide white or colored light. The covers <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and light sources <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be colored in any combination such that they produce a red or amber light when the light sources <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are illuminated, as appropriate to their function and any relevant government regulations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The length of the light assembly <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> also permits different sections of the light assembly <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to be controlled in different manners. In the embodiment shown, the front module is connected to the vehicle&apos;s electrical system in the same manner as a front turn signal, the middle module is connected to the electrical system solely as a side marker light, and the rear module is connected to the electrical system as a front turn signal repeater. All three modules incorporate reflect reflectors. Additional turn signals and side marker lights may be provided in conventional locations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In use, the modules are clearly visible from the front, rear and adjacent side of the vehicle. The modules provide a clear indication to other drivers of the outermost location of the front of the vehicle, which might otherwise be hard to see at night or in bad weather. As compared to lights which project from a fender or other part of the truck body, the module in accordance with the present invention also is less likely to be damaged by snagging, by flying debris, or by contact with other objects, in addition to presenting an aesthetically pleasing appearance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> While the preferred embodiment of the invention has been illustrated and described, it will be appreciated that various changes can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. </paragraph>
