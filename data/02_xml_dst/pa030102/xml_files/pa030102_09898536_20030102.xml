<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to apparatus, systems and methods for moving objects. More particularly, the invention relates to levitating, accelerating and decelerating objects with reduced friction and increased efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Magnetically levitated trains, conveyor systems and related means of transportation have been attempted many times in the past few decades in an effort to provide more efficient means of transportation for individuals and cargo. A few examples of such systems can be seen in U.S. Pat. No. 4,356,772 to van der Heide; U.S. Pat. No. 4,805,761 to Totsch; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,601,029 to Geraghty et al. These systems operate on the general property that magnets having like polarities repel each other, and magnets having opposite polarities attract each other. Notwithstanding the fact that patent applications have been filed for such systems for decades, a system for moving people and cargo that is viable under real world conditions has yet to be developed. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed towards apparatus, systems and methods for levitating and accelerating objects. In particular, embodiments of the present invention allow objects to be magnetically levitated and magnetically accelerated with respect to rails, such as train tracks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the system incorporates a number of lower rails spaced laterally apart from each other, and an object having a number of upper rails aligned with the lower rails. The lower rails have permanent magnets abutted one against the next and aligned such that the upper surface of the lower rail has a uniform polarity along its length. The lower rail also has a ferrous backing plate that electroconductively couples the permanent magnets along the length of the track. The upper rails have a number of permanent magnets aligned to oppose the magnets in the lower rails to levitate the object. The upper rails also have a ferrous backing plate electroconductively coupling the permanent magnets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment of the invention comprises a number of first rails, an object to be transferred, a third rail, and a driving disc. The first rails each have a number of permanent magnets aligned near its upper surface. The permanent magnets are oriented to create a uniform polarity along a length of each of the first rails. The object being transported has second rails that are configured to align with the first rails. The second rails have permanent magnets mounted thereon that are oriented to oppose the polarity of the magnets in the first rails. Consequently, the object levitates above the first rails. The third rail extends along the length of the first rails. The third rail is made from an electroconductive material, such as copper or aluminum. The disc is connected to the object being transported, and rotates with respect to the object. The disc carries a number of permanent magnets. The disc is positioned such that the permanent magnets are in close proximity to the third rail during operation. Rotation of the disc, and more importantly the permanent magnets, in the proximity of the third rail results in eddy currents that accelerate the object along the third rail in a direction opposite the relative rotation of the disc.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The present detailed description is generally directed toward systems, apparatus and methods for levitating a cart or other object above a track, and for accelerating the object with respect to the track. Several embodiments of the present invention may allow an individual to levitate an object above a track, and to accelerate and decelerate the object, all without contacting the track. Accordingly, such embodiments can provide highly efficient transportation means for individuals or cargo. Many specific details of certain embodiments of the invention are set forth in the following description and in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to provide a thorough understanding of such embodiments. One skilled in the art, however, will understand that the present invention may have additional embodiments or may be practiced without several of the details described in the following description. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates a system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for levitating and accelerating objects. The system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> incorporates a track <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a cart <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> configured to move longitudinally in either direction with respect to the track. The track <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> incorporates a pair of supporting rails <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and a driving rail <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiment, the supporting rails <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the driving rail <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are supported by a number of footings <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> spaced apart from each other along a length of track <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The footings <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are anchored to the ground as generally understood in the art. The driving rail <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in the illustrated embodiment is mounted directly to the footings <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, such as by a flange formed at the lower edge of the driving rail. The illustrated driving rail <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is centrally located along the length of each of the footings <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Depending on the particular design of the cart <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, however, it is envisioned that the driving rail <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can be positioned at other locations inside, outside, above and below the supporting rails <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, as would be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the relevant art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiment, the supporting rails <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are coupled to the footings <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by a number of posts <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and brackets <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and extend along opposing ends of the footings. As with the driving rail <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, however, different configurations are possible, as one of ordinary skill in the art would appreciate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The upper surface of each of the supporting rails <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> carries a number of permanent magnets <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> extending along an operable portion of its length. The illustrated permanent magnets <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are butted against each other along the length of the track <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to provide a magnetic force that is sufficiently constant to enable the cart <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to move smoothly along the track. The permanent magnets <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are oriented such that every magnet along the respective supporting rail <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has its polarity vertically aligned with the adjacent permanent magnets. The inventor appreciates that it is not necessary that every permanent magnet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> be aligned in order for the invention to operate. The illustrated embodiment, however, is provided as an example of one preferred embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference> best illustrate the cart <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> according to this particular embodiment of the present invention. The cart <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> incorporates a pair of opposing side rails <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> spaced apart to generally align with the supporting rails <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> on the track <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated embodiment, the side rails are made from a ferrous material such as steel. Other materials of like qualities can be substituted for steel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Attached to the underside of each of the side rails <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is another set of permanent magnets <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> that align with the permanent magnets <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> on the supporting rails <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> when the cart <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is engaged with the track <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The permanent magnets <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> on the cart <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are oriented with their polarities opposite to those of the permanent magnets <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the supporting rails <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. As a result, the cart <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> levitates above the track <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated embodiment, the permanent magnet <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> attached to the side rails <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are abutted one against the next. The inventor appreciates, however, that these permanent magnets need not be in contact with each other for the cart <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to have a smooth ride over the track <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The cart <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has a platform <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) for carrying individuals or objects. The present invention can be configured for carrying cargo or people and, as a result, the platform <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can have a wide variety of configurations. For example, platform <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can be in the shape of a train car or a cargo container. Likewise, the platform <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the cart <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be sized for carrying only small objects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The sides of the cart <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> have a number of rollers <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> spaced apart lengthwise along the cart. Rollers <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are positioned to contact the supporting rails <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> should the cart move out of proper alignment with the track <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The rollers <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> rotate about vertical axes, and consequently do not significantly affect the movement of the cart <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> along the track <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. It is envisioned by the inventor that a wide variety of means can be substituted for the rollers <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to keep the cart <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> centered along the track <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> battery <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, a motor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and a driving disc <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are housed within this particular cart <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The illustrated battery <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is a 12-volt battery similar to one currently used in an automobile. The inventor appreciates, however, that a wide variety of power sources can be substituted for the battery <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, such as a fuel cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The motor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is coupled to the driving disc <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> by a belt <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The inventor similarly appreciates, however, that the motor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and belt <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> can take other configurations, so long as the driving disc <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> can be controllably rotated to accelerate or decelerate the cart <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with respect to the track <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. An onboard control system <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) is incorporated to allow a user to controllably accelerate and decelerate the rotation of the driving disc <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to control the velocity and acceleration of the cart <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates the relative orientation of the permanent magnets <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> on the side rails <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the cart <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> when engaged with the track <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. As discussed above, the polarity of the permanent magnets <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is opposite the polarity of the permanent magnets <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. In addition, in this particular embodiment, the lateral dimension of the permanent magnets <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is greater than the lateral dimension of the permanent magnets <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The inventor appreciates that these permanent magnets <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can have the same dimensions, or the permanent magnets <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> could be larger than the permanent magnets <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> A ferrous backing material <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is positioned under the permanent magnets <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in the supporting rail <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. As with the side rails <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, the ferrous backing material <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> can be steel or an equivalent materials. The backing <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> extends along the length of the side rail <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> As best illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> driving pulley <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> on the motor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> operates the belt <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to rotate a driven pulley <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> attached to the driving disc <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The motor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is mounted on a cross-member <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, which is in turn mounted to the cart <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Similarly, the driving disc <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is mounted to an underside of the cross-member <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The driving disc <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is rotatably mounted on a pair bearings <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> to rotate with respect to the cart <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the third rail <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> has a neck <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and a flange <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. The flange <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is mounted to the footing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to retain the third rail <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in a fixed alignment with respect to the track <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The neck <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is in the form of a flat plate extending the length of the track <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The driving disc <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in the illustrated embodiment has a pair of magnet rotors <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, spaced one on each side of the neck <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the third rail <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Each of the magnet rotors <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> has a non-ferrous mounting disc <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> backed by a ferrous backing disc <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, preferably of mild steel. The mounting discs <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> may be aluminum or a suitable non-magnetic composite, and each is fabricated with a number of permanent magnets <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> spaced apart from each other and arranged in a circle about a shaft <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> carrying the driving disc <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Each of the permanent magnets <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> abuts on the outside of the driving disc <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> against the respective backing disc <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. Adjacent permanent magnets <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> may have their polarities reversed. The permanent magnets <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> are each spaced by an air gap <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> from the neck <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The mounting discs <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are mounted to the shaft <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> to rotate in unison with the shaft. Rotation of the driving disc <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> with respect to the neck <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> results in relative movement between the permanent magnets <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and the neck in a direction generally tangential to the driving disc. This tangential direction aligns with the length of the track. As is generally known in the industry, relative movement between a permanent magnet and an electroconductive material results in an eddy current urging the electroconductive material to follow the permanent magnets. In the present case, however, because the electroconductive material in the neck <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is fixed to the footing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the electroconductive material cannot follow the permanent magnets. Instead, an equal and opposite force is exerted on the cart which carries the permanent magnets <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. This opposing force accelerates the cart in a direction opposite to the movement of the permanent magnets <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, controlled rotation of the driving disc <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> with respect to the neck <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> can accelerate or decelerate the cart <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with respect to the track <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> It also understood in the industry that adjustable gap couplings can be used to increase and decrease the resultant forces between the permanent magnets <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and the neck <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The inventor incorporates herein by reference U.S. Pat. No. 6,005,317; U.S. Pat. No. 6,072,258; and U.S. Pat. No. 6,242,832 in their entireties to disclose various structures that can be used to adjust the spacing between the permanent magnets <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and the neck <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. Further, the inventor appreciates that a single magnet rotor <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> can be used instead of a pair of magnet rotors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of the present invention have numerous advantages over conveyance systems of the prior art. For example, the aligned polarities in the tracks and the ferrous backing material combine to create a powerful and consistant magnetic force which allows substantial weight to be carried and allows for smooth movement as the weight is transported along the track. Similarly, ferrous backing material incorporated into the side rails of the cart provides like benefits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In addition, the magnetic driving disc contained on the cart allows for closely controlled, efficient acceleration and deceleration. Because the driving disc does not contact the third rail, there is no wear between the two parts. Further, because the driving disc is contained on the cart, each cart can be independently controlled to accelerate and decelerate along the track. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The applicant appreciates that many modifications and variations can be made to the embodiments discussed above without diverging from the spirit of the invention. For example, carts can be fabricated with one, two or more driving discs to independently or collectively accelerate and decelerate the cart in the forward and reverse directions. Likewise, more or fewer supporting rails can be incorporated to modify the levitation forces and weight distribution characteristics of a particular system. As discussed above, the driving disc and third rail can be positioned in other locations, such as above the cart for &ldquo;suspended&rdquo; configurations. Other modifications and variations would be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. Accordingly, the scope of the invention should be interpreted only based on the claims below. </paragraph>
