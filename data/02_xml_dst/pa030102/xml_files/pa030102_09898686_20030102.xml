<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF TECHNOLOGY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention consists of the methods and apparatus for effecting communications between employees, and between employees and customers. Wherein individual gain is achieved through the use of empowerment and application tools such as auctions, scheduler, database, wherein the user receives incentive by points for value, and company ownership. The present invention provides employees with an opportunity to improve employment opportunities, obtain and increase in personal wealth by work efficiencies and an increase in customer attendance and sales. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Productivity can achieve greater gains by empowering employees with managerial responsibility. This is not new to manufacturing where Edward Deming&apos;s practices are used, but is a new concept for the service industries. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In a restaurant operation, for example, the raw materials are purchased, received, designed, developed or finished, presented for sale, invoiced, paid and reconciled in one place. The customer makes an electronic or physical contact, orders, accepts and pays for the food delivered at that same Unit. The employee makes an electronic or physical contact, receives a request for service or product and delivers the service or product at the Unit. Restaurant operations employ, train, order raw materials, receive and store inventory, prepare the food items for presentation, market, sell and deliver the finished product, collect information, collect payment and repeat the process with new and existing customers. The opportunity for profit improves if productivity tools and techniques are continuously created and/or refined to reduce missed opportunities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Service industries employ part-time and full-time employees for their technical skill. Many employees are not trained. For example, the restaurant industry provides entry-level jobs as dishwashers, hostesses and busboys. The waiter and waitress provide the majority of the communication with the customer. Customer loyalty today is determined by the combination of location, product quality, price and service. Today, the employee&apos;s role is limited. He or she has the opportunity to market and sell only at point of sale. The system inherent in this invention postulates that the employee possesses the skills to develop strong relationships with the restaurant clientele. In other industries, commission sales people generate loyalty. Commission salespeople have an opportunity to repeat sales in retail stores, and brokers dominate the financial industry. Insurance, annuity, mutual funds, stocks and bonds are products sold frequently with the same clients. In the financial industry, phone solicitations and monthly statements increase customer contact. Internet Protocol has expanded customer relationships to the point where sales costs have been reduced and customer retention has been increased. The restaurant industry is one of many industries having the same opportunity, when the invention is integrated into operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Entertainment is a growing industry and Units are providing greater diversity in themes. Card rooms, casinos and video arcades with food and beverage services provide greater marketing opportunities and incentives for customer loyalty. There are now numerous customer incentive programs through which points are accumulated and exchanged for drink, food, products and services such as air travel. Electronic scanners and database management programs provided the information and storage needed to facilitate premium redemption. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> A Unit is any business site (real or virtual) producing an item for sale or distribution. In the service industry, The Unit maybe, a department store, a specialty store, or a restaurant. A Unit may have as few as one individual with a book of clients and where the individual is employed by many different Units all separate and independent but linked to a sponsored companies (Sponsored Company) using the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The invention provides customers with additional incentives by facilitating the acquisition of value by awarding points that can be converted at an appropriate ratio into units or equity shares. The invention further comprises the points to be exchanged for currency or points acquired for cash in an auction. Customer incentives are enhanced by his or her understanding of the point value of the holdings. The value is identified in the invention by the database Tabulator that is accessible to the customer. The Tabulator provides the explanation of points, units, shares, merchandise, and services. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The invention is an empowerment system that improves an employee&apos;s satisfaction and financial future by providing incentives for generating customer satisfaction and repeat business. The employee is given the opportunity to accept assignment for proprietary customer contact and to convert those customers to frequent clients. The customer purchases are events and are transaction events generating points. The points are converted to value using the invention where the customer has a choice of value. The company representative is the employee assigned to the customer and using the system, he or she can provide explanation. The ISS provides the employee with the support needed to succeed in that effort through a continuously updated customer profile and the employee can use a Customer File Manager Database (CFM). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Employees are empowered in each Unit to improve skills continuously. That skill development improves employee communication and success, and consequently, employee compensation, satisfaction and morale. For example, in department stores today, employees are not currently trained in the use of electronic mail, database file maintenance or other software tools. The present invention provides the system and infrastructure to assist in that skill development. With the acceleration of distance learning, Company learning programs can improve employee productivity. The current art allows measurement of employee productivity. Employee empowerment provides cost savings where such tools and training are provided for employee advancement within the Unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Customer satisfaction increases when the Unit employees use the data in the ISS to acknowledge customer preferences when they communicate telephonically, electronically and at the point of sale. Department store sales will be increased when employees can easily mine preference data stored reflecting previous purchases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The Internet and other distributed networks provide efficient communication to the customer from the employee and employee to employee, collaborating, using peer to peer technology. The ISS provides the structure to send messages, the files to personalize the message from a database and the record of the message and its response. The customer uses the Internet to access the company Web site by a host computer for news and information, using a proprietary ID which is secure, and the empowerment modules (Auction Module) at which points are exchanged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The ISS uses Customer Relationship Management tools to email customer alerts regarding promotions, point values, equity valuation, special events and company news. E-mail is a valuable tool that, when used effectively, can help the employee build customer loyalty and increase transaction events. In a specific industry as retail, department stores use personal shoppers, commission sale people who write or call customers when new merchandise is available or when existing merchandise is placed on sale. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Employee empowerment through application of the ISS creates considerable cost savings. The Unit&apos;s management role typical in service industries today is limited or eliminated through application of the ISS. For example, in a restaurant, the skilled employee with the highest employee classification provides any daily management decision making for the Unit. Those with the highest employee classifications will have achieved high levels of skills important to the Unit. In a restaurant for example, the employee in charge will have achieved through operating experience, an understanding of accounting, waitperson coverage limitations, cooking and other food preparation, restaurant purchasing, equipment supply and maintenance. The ISS empowers employees to make both front and back of the house management decisions in this specific operation. The employee in charge has achieved the levels of important skills at the Unit. These employees replace full time managers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The invention provides the employee the management of work schedules wherein the employee uses the work shift module, Scheduler and the Schedule Auction. A Scheduler identifies employee work shifts and empowers employees to trade or auction work shifts with other work shift users. The invention encourages empowerment and effects the change furthering the decrease of management supervision. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The Scheduler is the system&apos;s database that provides real time information regarding work shift availability for the employee. Seasonal and cyclical demand creates stress in the retail industry, transportation, and housing. The System adjusts the demand for work shifts to reflect seasonal and holiday occupancy and retail sales peaks, high delivery demand periods, and weak or strong weekend traffic or occupancy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Outsourcing labor is a growing business and the demand for qualified workers is accelerating. The healthcare service industry provides home health services through which skilled nurses provide the home treatments. Eighty percent of healthcare can be accomplished by a registered nurse. The Sponsored Company can provide long-term employment with wealth accumulation and it may have better efficiencies than the current operating ratios in the marketplace. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> For example, in the restaurant and hospitality industry today, shift changes are most often the responsibility of the manager. Utilizes the ISS, an employee agrees to work for a Unit, he or she accepts the obligation to fulfill the work shifts assigned and to use the Scheduler and the Schedule Auction to exchange shifts for shifts or shifts for points. The point system provides additional incentive to negotiate since certain shifts may be more attractive from the perspective of creating return in equity or points per shift. To again use the restaurant industry as an example, exchanging a holiday shift will likely require the employee wishing to have the time off to offer a premium in points to the employee who agrees to work the shift. Work shifts are viewed as opportunities to acquire points and improve the employee customer accounts, revenue classification rating and equity. Or aggressive employees whose families are away may choice to work holiday and he or she may want to post a reverse auction, buyer&apos;s auction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Auction tools are used in current applications to place merchandise up for bids and allowing buyers to bid against each other for the item. Overstock, used merchandise and unique items are sold in this format. Auction are used because these items are hard to price. An auction opens the transaction dynamically and, after some period of time has elapsed, the item is sold to the highest bidder. The Scheduler Auction is an application through which the employee has the opportunity to acquire not merchandise, but instead additional work shifts as determined by the terms agreed to through an auction process which the auction process is well known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Use of Auction on NASDAQ is negotiated. Market Makers who are regulated create the buy and sell side. Markets become more efficient as volume is increased and the spread between the bid and offer narrows. Points which are earned by users have an assigned value. For every point, there is a ratio divided into a share of the Sponsored Company. Points are negotiated in an auction between members and value is created when ownership shifts from points to equity or points to product acceptance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The ISS helps to empower employees by offering the incentives designed to help the employee gain greater levels of producing customer satisfaction, loyalty and retention, managerial skills, business negotiation ability, database management, e-mail and an understanding of business valuation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The Employee Subscription Contract is the agreement between the company and the employee that provides the employee the ISS. The employee Identification Profile empowers the employee to exchange points and work shifts, and to access the customer database. Point rewards are adjusted to the level of work performed and the return for the work shift. There is an employee classification, which is a part of the ID. The employee is encouraged to continuously improve using the ISS. The performance of each employee measured by sales per Unit, return on equity per Unit, return on investment, work shift days, point accumulation, equity accumulation. The transaction events are based upon the subscription agreement and the employee ID is updated in the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The Customer Subscription Agreement is a binding contract. Its purpose is to bind the customer to the rules of the Sponsored Company. The terms and conditions are the membership requirements. The customer agrees to provide the information needed to allow the issuance of points, units and equity and/or the exchange of points, units and equity. The Agreement is inclusive and the points and equity exchanges are exclusive and can only be exchanged within the Sponsored Company&apos;s Point Auction. Points and equity can not be transferred or sold without the approval of the Sponsored Company, and in accordance with the laws governing securities and restricted shares. The transaction events are based upon the subscription agreement and the customer ID is updated in the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> ID enables empowerment by profiling the employee. This empowerment enables to exchange points, exchange work shifts, and access the database. Point rewards are adjusted to the level of work classification. The employee can be obligated to continuously improve using the ISS. The ISS through its database has the data for all employees and each employee is statistically measured by sales per Unit, return on equity per Unit, return on investment, point accumulation, share accumulation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> When points are converted to units or to shares of Sponsored Company shares outstanding, customer loyalty could be enhanced by the customer nature of ownership in the business. </paragraph>
