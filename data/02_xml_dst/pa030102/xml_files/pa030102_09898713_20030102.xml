<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The disclosed invention is generally directed to ink jet printheads employed in ink jet printers, and more particularly to an ink jet printhead that includes an orifice plate having grooves formed thereon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The art of ink jet printing is relatively well developed. Commercial products such as computer printers, graphics plotters, and facsimile machines have been implemented with ink jet technology for producing printed media. The contributions of Hewlett-Packard Company to ink jet technology are described, for example, in various articles in the <highlight><italic>Hewlett</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>Packard Journal</italic></highlight>, Vol. 36, No. 5 (May 1985); Vol. 39, No. 5 (October 1988); Vol. 43, No. 4 (August 1992); Vol. 43, No. 6 (December 1992); and Vol. 45, No. 1 (February 1994); all incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Generally, an ink jet image is formed pursuant to precise placement on a print medium of ink drops emitted by an ink drop generating device known as an ink jet printhead. Typically, an ink jet printhead is supported on a movable print carriage that traverses over the surface of the print medium and is controlled to eject drops of ink at appropriate times pursuant to command of a microcomputer or other controller, wherein the timing of the application of the ink drops is intended to correspond to a pattern of pixels of the image being printed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A typical Hewlett-Packard ink jet printhead includes an array of precisely formed nozzles in an orifice plate that is attached to an ink barrier layer which in turn is attached to a thin film substructure that implements ink firing heater resistors and apparatus for enabling the resistors. The ink barrier layer defines ink channels including ink chambers disposed over associated ink firing resistors, and the nozzles in the orifice plate are aligned with associated ink chambers. Ink drop generator regions are formed by the ink chambers and portions of the thin film substructure and the orifice plate that are adjacent the ink chambers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The thin film substructure is typically comprised of a substrate such as silicon on which are formed various thin film layers that form thin film ink firing resistors, apparatus for enabling the resistors, and also interconnections to bonding pads that are provided for external electrical connections to the printhead. The ink barrier layer is typically a polymer material that is laminated as a dry film to the thin film substructure, and is designed to be photodefinable and both UV and thermally curable. Ink is fed from one or more ink reservoirs to the various ink chambers around ink feed edges that can comprises sides of the thin film substructure or sides of ink feed slots formed in the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> An example of the physical arrangement of the orifice plate, ink barrier layer, and thin film substructure is illustrated at page 44 of the <highlight><italic>Hewlett</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>Packard Journal </italic></highlight>of February 1994, cited above. Further examples of ink jet printheads are set forth in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,719,477 and 5,317,346, both of which are incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Considerations with ink jet printheads include puddling on the nozzle plate which can affect print quality and reliability.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DISCLOSURE </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In the following detailed description and in the several figures of the drawing, like elements are identified with like reference numerals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, set forth therein is an unscaled schematic perspective view of an ink jet printhead in which the invention can be employed and which generally includes (a) a thin film substructure or die <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> comprising a substrate such as silicon and having various thin film layers formed thereon, (b) an ink barrier layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> disposed on the thin film substructure <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and (c) an orifice or nozzle plate <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> attached to the top of the ink barrier <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The thin film substructure <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is formed pursuant to integrated circuit fabrication techniques, and includes thin film heater resistors <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> formed therein. By way of illustrative example, the thin film heater resistors <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are located in rows along longitudinal ink feed edges <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>a of the thin film substructure <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The ink barrier layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed of a dry film that is heat and pressure laminated to the thin film substructure <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and photodefined to form therein ink chambers <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and ink channels <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. Gold bond pads <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> engagable for external electrical connections are disposed at the ends of the thin film substructure <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and are not covered by the ink barrier layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. By way of illustrative example, the barrier layer material comprises an acrylate based photopolymer dry film such as the Parad brand photopolymer dry film obtainable from E.I. duPont de Nemours and Company of Wilmington, Del. Similar dry films include other duPont products such as the &ldquo;Riston&rdquo; brand dry film and dry films made by other chemical providers. The orifice plate <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> comprises, for example, a planar substrate comprised of a polymer material and in which the orifices are formed by laser ablation, for example as disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 5,469,199, incorporated herein by reference. The orifice plate can also comprise, by way of further example, a plated metal such as nickel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The ink chambers <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> in the ink barrier layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are more particularly disposed over respective ink firing resistors <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> formed in the thin film substructure <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and each ink chamber <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is defined by the edge or wall of a chamber opening formed in the barrier layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The ink channels <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> are defined by further openings formed in the barrier layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and are integrally joined to respective ink firing chambers <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The orifice plate <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> includes orifices <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> disposed over respective ink chambers <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, such that an ink firing resistor <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, an associated ink chamber <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, and an associated orifice <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> form an ink drop generator <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Optionally, an orifice <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> can include an outlet counterbore <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> While the disclosed printheads are described as having a barrier layer and a separate orifice plate, it should be appreciated that the printheads can be implemented with an integral barrier/orifice structure that can be made, for example, using a single photopolymer layer that is exposed with a multiple exposure process and then developed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The ink drop generators <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are arranged in columnar arrays or groups that extend along a reference axis L. By way of illustrative example, the columnar arrays of ink drop generators <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are spaced apart from each other laterally or transversely relative to the reference axis L and are adjacent respective ink feed edges <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The thin film substructure <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can be rectangular, wherein ink feed edges <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are longitudinal edges of a length dimension while longitudinally spaced apart, opposite edges <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are of a width or lateral dimension that is less than the length of the thin film substructure <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The longitudinal extent of the thin film substructure <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is along the ink feed edges <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>which can be parallel to the reference axis L. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The ink drop generators in a column can be staggered so that at least some of the nozzles <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are slightly off a center line CL of the column that is parallel to the reference axis L. In this manner, the nozzles <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of a particular column of drop generators can be at different distances from the associated ink feed edge <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the thin film substructure. Staggering of nozzles can be employed to compensate for firing delays, for example, in printing applications wherein printing is accomplished by relative movement between the printhead and a print medium along a carriage scan axis CA that is perpendicular to the reference axis L. In such application, the reference axis L can be aligned with what is generally referred to as the paper or media axis MA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, small narrow trenches or grooves <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> are formed in the top surface of the orifice plate <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in the vicinity of the nozzles. The grooves <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> do not connect with the orifices <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The grooves <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> more particularly are disposed on one side of the orifices <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, while the grooves <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> pass between adjacent nozzles. The grooves encourage puddled ink in the vicinity of the nozzles to flow away from the nozzles, for example by wicking the puddled ink away from the vicinity of the nozzles. Two grooves <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> between adjacent nozzles also tend to prevent the formation of larger puddles between nozzles by preventing merger of puddles from adjacent nozzles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> For example, associated with each nozzle is a group <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> of grooves that includes two parallel longer grooves <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> located adjacent diametrically opposite points of a reference diameter RD of the nozzle opening and spaced from such nozzle opening by at least 3 micrometers. The reference diameter RD can be parallel to the column axis CL. The group <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> of grooves further includes a plurality of shorter grooves <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> that are parallel to and located between the longer grooves <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> associated with a nozzle. The shorter grooves <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> extend laterally or transversely relative to the reference diameter RD, and can be arranged in colinear pairs each having a short groove on one side of the nozzle and a short groove on the other side of the nozzle. Such sides of a nozzle are the semi-circular edges or boundaries of the nozzle on either side of the reference diameter RD. The grooves <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> associated with a nozzle opening can be uniformly spaced along a direction parallel to the reference diameter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Adjacent grooves <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> respectively associated with adjacent nozzles can be more closely spaced than the grooves <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> of a group <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> of grooves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Each of the grooves <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> can have rounded ends and a groove width GW in the range of about 2 micrometers to 5 micrometers. By way of illustrative example, the length L of the longer grooves <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> can be about 400 micrometers, and the distance S between the distal ends of a colinear pair of grooves <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is about 400 micrometers. The transverse most ends of the grooves <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> on each side of the column of nozzles can be colinear and parallel to the longitudinal axis CL of the column of nozzles or the reference diameter RD. Also, the transverse most ends of the grooves <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> can be non-colinear. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Generally, the grooves <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> can be oriented so as to be substantially parallel to the carriage scan axis CA of a printer in which the printhead is installed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Although the foregoing has been a description and illustration of specific embodiments of the invention, various modifications and charges thereto can be made by persons skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention as defined by the following claims. </paragraph>
