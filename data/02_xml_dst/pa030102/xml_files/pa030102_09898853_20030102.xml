<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to auditing events and conditions relating to the operation of elevator car doors and landing doors to provide maintenance messages indicative of maintenance action which is recommended to be taken, and maintaining the elevator in response to the maintenance messages. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Elevator service known to the art depends primarily on periodic inspections and periodic performance of preventive actions, such as rebuilding subsystems, changing parts that are known to wear out, and the like. However, the periods of time between such inspections and preventive actions is based on average elevator environment, average elevator usage and average elevator maintenance. Therefore, the selected time period bears little relevance to the actual conditions of any particular elevator. In addition, periodic inspections rarely detect existing or impending problems. Periodic preventive actions are wasteful when unnecessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Prior elevator maintenance and repair has heretofore been based on very little information, depending instead on the intuition of service personnel which in turn depends substantially on the experience level of the service personnel. Service personnel must first determine the likely source of a problem and then make a subjective decision about what, if any, action is to be taken. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In the prior art, there is little if any assistance in detecting intermittent problems. When a problem has occurred but the elevator is running on arrival of the service personnel, the problem will not then be apparent to the service personnel. Maintenance recommendation messages provided by prior art maintenance systems have typically been very general, such as &ldquo;problem closing door&rdquo; or &ldquo;problem opening door&rdquo;. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Objects of the invention include: providing elevator door service and maintenance based upon factual information, including both performance and failure information, relative to the landing and car doors of a specific elevator; reducing reliance on periodic inspection and periodic preventive action for elevator door-related maintenance; providing necessary elevator door-related maintenance while reducing unnecessary maintenance activities; eliminating reliance on subjective intuition of service personnel in maintaining and servicing elevator doors; reducing reliance on experience of service personnel in maintaining and servicing elevator doors; finding the origin of elevator door problems quickly; restoring elevator service faster after having door problems; detecting the cause of intermittent elevator door problems; providing information allowing the identification of obscure elevator door problems; and permitting corrective action to be taken even when the elevator is running on arrival of service personnel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, performance and failure information relative to the landing and car doors of an elevator is extracted, stored and analyzed to provide sets of recommended maintenance actions and problem resolution service actions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> (A) According to the present invention, operating speeds, operating times, positions, events, discrete conditions, durations, and numbers of occurrences are monitored and stored, and the information is logically combined, accumulated, averaged compared against specific corresponding threshold values, and so forth, to determine when notable events have occurred and to identify the nature thereof, which then determines maintenance messages identifying recommended maintenance and/or service actions which should be taken. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> (B) The invention includes performance of a maintenance operation on the elevator system in response to any such maintenance messages, which include: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> (C) adjusting the position of the car door vane; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> (D) adjusting the position of the landing door lock at a given floor; </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> (O)-(Q) adjusting a flexible traction loop (the door drive belt); </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> (R)-(CC) adjusting the elevator car door motor or the related door controller mechanism; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> (DD)-(FF) adjusting or replacing the door position encoder; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> (GG)-(KK) adjusting or replacing the between-door safety device; </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">MODE(S) FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> routine that generates information about the landing door lock switch is reached through a start entry point <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and the program waits at a first test <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> until the car door and the landing door are both closed; then a test <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> determines if the landing door lock switch is open. With the door closed, the landing door lock switch will initially not be open, so a test <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> determines if the car door closed sensor is operated. The routine will cycle between tests <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> until either the landing door lock switch opens or the car door closed sensor no longer senses that the car door is closed. If the landing door lock switch opens first, an affirmative result of test <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> leads to a step <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> where the position of the car door as the landing door lock switch opens is set equal to the car door position, which is provided by a car door position sensor of a conventional type. In a step <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, the speed of the car door as the landing door lock switch opens is set equal to the pulse width of the pulse from the door position encoder which is one pulse ahead of the current pulse. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Then a pair of steps <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> store the time stamp (present real time) and floor number (where the car is at this instant), and the feature, which is a way of identifying an event or occurrence of a particular nature; in this case the feature is referred to as &ldquo;landing door lock position&rdquo;. In the embodiment described herein, a &ldquo;feature&rdquo; may be an actual parameter used in the method of auditing and method of maintenance of the invention, or it may simply be the signaling of the event which may be used in processing to achieve the methods of the invention. In this case, the feature, landing door lock position, may be used as an indication that parameters <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> should be examined. In the drawing, parameter numbers are provided within circles. Some parameters, such as Parameter No. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the number of car door operations, are obtained in a trivial fashion and therefore are not shown or described. Then step <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> stores Parameter No. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the position of the car door as the landing door lock switch opens, and step <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> stores Parameter No. <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, the speed of the car door as the landing door lock switch opens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> If in test <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, the car door closed position sensor no longer senses that the car door is closed, before test <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> determines that the landing door lock switch is open, a test <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> determines if the landing door lock switch is open; initially it will not be so a test <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> determines if the car door is fully open. Initially the car door will not be fully open, so a negative result of test <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> will cause the routine to loop through test <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and test <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> until either the landing door lock switch is fully open, which is the usual case, or the car door becomes fully open without the landing door lock switch opening, which is a remarkable event. If the landing door lock switch opens, the steps <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> are performed as described hereinbefore. But if the car door becomes fully open while the landing door lock switch is not open, an affirmative result of test <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> reaches steps <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> to store the time stamp and floor number and to store Parameter No. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, a feature called &ldquo;landing door lock switch bypassed&rdquo;. This feature indicates either that the switch is jammed in a closed position, or that a technician may have placed jumper leads across the switch, or that the switch may appear to be closed due to conductivity of dust or other debris. In this case the feature is an event which is also a parameter. Note that some parameters are expressed differently in the text from the expression in the drawing: Parameter No. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is also referred to as &ldquo;the landing door lock switch being closed when the landing door is open&rdquo;. However, identity is established through the parameter numbers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, another routine relating to the landing door lock switch is reached through a start entry point <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> and the routine waits at a first test <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> until the car door begins to close. Then a test <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> determines if the landing door lock switch is closed. Initially, it will not be so a test <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> will determine if the car door has stopped, and the routine will cycle through steps <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> until the car door is stopped. When the car door stops, a test <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> determines if the car door closed sensor has actuated, and if not, the routine will cycle through the tests <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> until the car door close sensor is actuated by the car door becoming closed. When the car door is closed, a waiting timer is initiated in a step <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and a test <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> determines if the landing door lock switch is closed; assume for now that it is not, then a test <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> will determine if the car door is opening. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> With the car door closed sensor just having been actuated, test <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> will usually be initially negative cycling back through test <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> until either the door lock switch becomes closed or the car door begins to open. If the car door begins to open, then a test <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> determines if the waiting timer, which was initiated in step <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, has advanced past a threshold or not. If not, it probably means that the landing door lock switch did not close because the car door began to open as soon as it was closed. Thus, a negative result of test <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> causes the routine to revert to the test <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. But after the waiting timer exceeds a threshold amount of time, which may be on the order of two or three seconds, an affirmative result of test <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> will reach a series of steps <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> which store the time stamp and floor number, the feature &ldquo;landing door lock switch failure&rdquo; which is a combination of Parameter No. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the landing door lock switch not closing and Parameter No. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, landing door lock switch closed (indicating yes or no, as to whether it is or not). Then the program reverts to step <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> as described hereinbefore. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> If the landing door lock switch had closed as soon as the car door closed sensor had been activated, then an affirmative result of test <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> would have reached a step <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> to initiate a rebound timer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Then a test <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> determines if the rebound timer has exceeded a maximum rebound time limit, or not. Initially it will not, so a negative result of test <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> reaches a test <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> to determine if the landing door lock switch is closed or not. If it remains closed, then the routine loops between tests <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> until the rebound timer times out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> But, if the door switch does not remain closed before the rebound timer times out, then a negative result of test <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> will reach test <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, and the routine will proceed as described hereinbefore. On the other hand, if the switch remains closed until after the rebound timer times out, that means that the switch did not rebound into the open state, and an affirmative result of test <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> will reach a test <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> to see if the landing door lock switch remains closed. In the usual case, it will until the landing door reopens. When the test <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> indicates that the landing door lock switch is no longer closed, then a test <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> determines if there has been a door open command; if there has, this indicates normal operation and the routine reverts to test <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to await the door closing once again. On the other hand, if the door lock switch does not remain closed and there is no door open command, then a negative result of test <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> reaches a pair of steps <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> to store the time stamp and floor number and to store Parameter No. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the feature called landing door lock switch open without command. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Assume that the routine reaches tests <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and the waiting timer has not timed out. A negative result of test <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> will return the routine to test <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, and if the car door is closing, will reach tests <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>, depending on conditions. If test <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is positive, then a step <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> will initiate the waiting timer and all of the other tests and steps <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> are bypassed. The routine is thereafter as described hereinbefore, beginning with step <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> which initiates the rebound timer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> routine which monitors door lock switch rebounds and speed as the door lock closes, is reached through a start entry point <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and the routine will wait at a test <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> until the car door is open. Then the routine will wait at a test <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> until the car door is closing, after which a step <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> sets a rebound counter equal to zero and a step <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> resets a timer used in this routine. Then a test <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> determines if the landing door lock switch is closed; if not, a test <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> determines if the car door is opening; if neither is happening, the routine waits, looping through tests <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> until either the landing door lock switch becomes closed or the car door is opening. When the landing door lock switch becomes closed, a test <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> determines if the rebound counter is still at zero or not. If so, a step <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> sets the speed of the car door as the landing door lock switch closes equal to car door speed. A step <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> initiates a timer; note that a &ldquo;timer&rdquo; in one routine is not related to a &ldquo;timer&rdquo; in another routine. Then a test <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> determines if the landing door lock switch is open; if not, a test <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> determines if the timer has passed 150 milliseconds or not. Until either the landing door lock switch becomes open or the timer exceeds 150 milliseconds, the routine will loop between tests <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. If the landing door lock switch opens, a test <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> determines if the car door is opening; if not, this means that the landing door lock switch has rebounded into the open condition after having been closed (test <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> followed by test <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In that case, a step <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> increments the rebounds counter and the routine reverts to test <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, if the landing door lock switch becomes open so that test <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is affirmative because the car door is opening, test <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> is affirmative and a series of steps <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> store the time stamp and the floor number, and a feature called &ldquo;landing door lock performance&rdquo;, along with Parameter No. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the number of landing door lock switch rebounds, and Parameter No. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the speed of the car door as the landing door lock switch closes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The feature, landing door lock performance, is not used as a parameter but may be used to trigger examination of parameters <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> routine that determines closure of the car door closed switch, the car door closed position, and whether the car door closed switch is bypassed, is reached through a start entry point <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. A first test <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> causes the routine to wait until the car door is closing. Then a test <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> determines if the car door closed switch is closed; if not, a test <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> determines if the car door may be opening, which happens when passengers press a hall call button or a door open button, or activate a between door safety device. The routine will revert to test <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> if the car door is opening. Assuming the car door closed switch becomes closed, a step <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> sets the value of the position of the car door when the car door closed switch becomes closed equal to the present car door position. Then the routine waits at a test <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> until the car door becomes stopped. A step <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> then sets the car door closed position equal to the present car door position. A series of steps <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> store the time stamp and floor number, and the feature known as car door switch position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> This feature is not used as a parameter but may be used for control purposes. Parameter No. <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, position of car door when car door closed switch becomes closed, and Parameter No. <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the car door closed position, are also stored. The routine then waits at a test <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> until the car door is opening. When the car door is opening, the car door closed switch should no longer be closed. So in the normal case, a negative result of a test <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> causes the routine to revert to the start state at test <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. However, if the car door switch remains closed when the car door is opening, an affirmative result of test <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> reaches a test <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> to cause the program to cycle through both tests until the car door is fully open. Then a pair of steps <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> store the time stamp, floor number and the feature known as &ldquo;car door closed switch bypassed&rdquo;, which is a combination of Parameters Nos. <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and indicates that the door closed switch is short circuited, or that lint or other debris are conducting across the switch&apos;s open contacts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>, a routine which tests the car door closed switch for failure and for opening without a command is reached through a start entry point <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> and the routine then waits at a test <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> until the car door is closing. When the car door is closing, a test <highlight><bold>149</bold></highlight> determines if the car door closed switch is closed or not. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Initially, the switch normally will not be closed when the car door begins closing, so a negative result of test <highlight><bold>149</bold></highlight> reaches a test <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> to determine if the car is moving. If the car is moving, the routine reverts to the start state at test <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight>. Normally, the car will not be moving so a negative result of test <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> reaches a test <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> to determine if the car door closed sensor is activated. In the usual case, it will not initially be activated so the program will revert to test <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> and cycle through tests <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> until the car door closed sensor is actuated. When that happens, there is a potential switch failure, as described more fully hereinafter. A step <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> initiates a waiting timer and a step <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> sets the car door closed switch closed indicator to &ldquo;no&rdquo;. A test <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> determines if the car door closed switch has closed yet or not; if not, a test <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> determines if there has been a door open command. The routine will cycle between tests <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> until either the car door closed switch becomes closed or there is a door open command. The door open command signals the end of any possibility of the car door closed switch becoming closed. A test <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> determines if a waiting timer has exceeded a threshold, such as on the order of two or three seconds. If not, this means that the failure of the car door closed switch to close is not a notable event so a negative result of test <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> causes the routine to revert to the start state at test <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>. But if the timer has timed out, this means that there is a failure of the car door closed switch to close, so a series of steps <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> store the time stamp and floor number, and the feature named &ldquo;car door closed switch failure&rdquo;, which is made up of Parameter Nos. <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>; Parameter No. <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, car door closed switch closed (yes or no) is also stored. And then the program reverts to the start state at test <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In a normal course of events, as the car door is closing (test <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> affirmative) the routine will pass through the steps and tests <highlight><bold>149</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> and reach test <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> (perhaps passing through test <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> once or twice) and eventually the car door closed switch will be closed. Then a step <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> initiates the rebound timer (this is a different rebound timer than the one utilized in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) and a step <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight> will set the indicator for the car door closed switch closed to &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. A test <highlight><bold>169</bold></highlight> determines if the rebound timer has timed out or not, to be sure that the car door closed switch will remain closed. The routine will cycle between tests <highlight><bold>169</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> until the rebound timer times out or the car door closed switch becomes open. In that event, the routine will proceed from test <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>, as described hereinbefore. Assuming the rebound timer times out with the car door closed switch still closed, an affirmative result of test <highlight><bold>169</bold></highlight> reaches a &ldquo;continue&rdquo; transfer point <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> to reach additional portions of the routine set forth on <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Initially, test <highlight><bold>149</bold></highlight> is negative; but if the door is moving, test <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> is positive, leading back to tests <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>149</bold></highlight>. In a normal case, the car door closed switch will close before the door stops, so test <highlight><bold>149</bold></highlight> will then reach steps <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight> which initiate the waiting and rebound timers. Then, the routine operates as described hereinbefore. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the car door switch routine is continued through the transfer point <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>. A test <highlight><bold>173</bold></highlight> determines if the car is running; if not, a test <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> determines if the car door closed switch is closed or not. In the usual case, since this part of the program is reached only from test <highlight><bold>149</bold></highlight> or test <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> being affirmative, test <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> will usually be affirmative. But if the car door opens at a landing, then a negative result of test <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> will reach a test <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> to set the in-flight indicator to &ldquo;no&rdquo;, because test <highlight><bold>173</bold></highlight> found the car was not running. On the other hand, if the car is running, then a negative result of test <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> will reach a step <highlight><bold>179</bold></highlight> to set the in flight indicator to &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. If the door opens with the car at a landing or in flight within the door zone, it may well be a normal opening in response to a door open command. Therefore, an affirmative result of a test <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> will cause the routine to return through the transfer point <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> to the start state in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. But if the car door switch is not closed, and there is no door open command, then that is a notable event, and a step <highlight><bold>183</bold></highlight> sets a position value equal to the car door position and a step <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> initiates a waiting timer. Then a test <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight> determines if there is a door open command; at this stage of the routine, there initially will not be, so a negative result of test <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight> reaches a test <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> to see if the car door closed switch is closed; since this part of the routine is reached from a negative result of test <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight>, initially the car door closed switch will not be closed, thereby reaching a test <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> to see if the waiting timer has passed one second yet. Initially, since it was set in step <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight>, it will not have passed one second. In this embodiment, low values of door position are toward the door being closed, and high values toward open. A test <highlight><bold>189</bold></highlight> checks if the present car door position is greater than the position value, which it will be if the car door is still opening, thereby indicating a door-open problem. An affirmative result of test <highlight><bold>189</bold></highlight> reaches a step <highlight><bold>199</bold></highlight> to update the position value to the present car door position. Then the routine reverts to the test <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> to see if either there is a door open command or the car door closed switch has finally closed. So long as neither of these occur, the routine will cycle through tests and steps <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight>. Once test <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> is affirmative, the car door position is no longer updated. If the car door is closed, and the problem is in the switch, then the position will not be less than the car door position and no updating occurs in step <highlight><bold>191</bold></highlight>. Similarly, if the car door stops, then the position is no longer updated. The position of the car door, whether it be because the car door has stopped or whether it be because the one second has timed out, gives an indication of whether the problem is in the switch or the door mechanism. Eventually, there will either be a door open command or the car door closed switch will become closed (for instance if the car door had been opened by a passenger and now is allowed to close again) so an affirmative result of one of the tests <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> will lead to a step <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> which sets Parameter No. <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, car switch problem position, equal to the position set in steps <highlight><bold>183</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>191</bold></highlight>. Then a pair of steps <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight> store the time stamp and floor number, as well as Parameter No. <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, a feature called &ldquo;car door closed switch open without command&rdquo;. Parameter No. <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, the car door switch problem position, and Parameter No. <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, whether the door opening was in flight, yes or no, are also stored in steps <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>197</bold></highlight>. And then the program reverts to the start state in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> through the return transfer point <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7, a</cross-reference> routine relating to door opening time is reached through a start entry point <highlight><bold>199</bold></highlight> and waits at a test <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> until the car door is closed. Then the routine waits at a test <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> until the car door is opening. Measuring of opening time will begin as soon as the car barely opens to a minimum position, as is determined by a test <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. But if the test <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is negative, a test <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> determines if the car door is closing, such as when it opens only part way before closing in the nudging mode to prevent further door reversals; in which case the routine will revert to the start state at test <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. In the normal course, the door will quickly reach the minimum position and a step <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> will initiate a timer. As the door opens, the routine cycles between a test <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> to see if the door is essentially fully open at a maximum position, and a test <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> to see if the car door is closing. If the car door begins to close, the test is terminated by the routine reaching the start state at test <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. When the door does reach the maximal position, a step <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> sets a door mode indicator equal to whatever the door controller mode is: the door modes may be opening or closing normally, or opening or closing at a low constant door motor current; a test <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> sets the door opening time equal to the timer setting. Then a series of steps <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> store the time stamp and floor number, the feature called &ldquo;opening speed&rdquo;, as well as door opening time, which can be either Parameter No. <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, average time required to open car door at constant door motor current, or Parameter No. <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> time it takes for the door to open, depending on Parameter No. <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, door mode, which is stored by a step <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. Then the routine reverts to the stop state at the test <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> illustrates a routine for measuring door closing time. Since it is exactly the same as <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, except relating to closing instead of opening, further description is not required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The routine of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> determines door distance when the door does not remain fully open or fully closed, due to friction. The routine is reached through a start entry point <highlight><bold>237</bold></highlight> and then waits at a test <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> until the door motor is closing, which can be determined by the door controller command to the door motor. Once the door motor is closing, a step <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> sets the door state to closing. A step <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight> sets the minimum door position equal to the car door position and continuously updates the minimum door position so long as a test <highlight><bold>243</bold></highlight> indicates that the door motor is still closing. Once the door motor is no longer closing, a step <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> initiates a timer and a test <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> continuously checks to see when the timer has exceeded one second. So long as one second has not passed, a test <highlight><bold>247</bold></highlight> determines if the door motor is opening or not; if it is, the retrocession test (hereinafter) cannot be made, and an affirmative result of test <highlight><bold>247</bold></highlight> will cause the routine to advance to the opening tests and steps. In the usual case, if a door open command has not occurred within one second after the door motor ceases to be operating in the closing direction, then the door will remain closed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Then, a step <highlight><bold>249</bold></highlight> sets the closing retrocession distance equal to the minimum door distance finally established in step <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight> minus the present car door position. Then a series of steps <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight> store the time stamp, the floor number, and a feature called &ldquo;door retrocession&rdquo;; Parameter No. <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the closing retrocession distance, and the door state are also stored. Then the program advances to and waits at a test <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> until the door motor is opening. Then steps and tests <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight> are performed which are the same as steps and tests <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight>, except that they relate to opening instead of closing. Therefore, further description is not required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> A routine that determines whether or not there is a car door closed sensor position error is reached in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> through a start entry point <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>, and the routine then waits at tests <highlight><bold>271</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight> until the car door closed sensor is actuated and the car door is stopped. Then a test <highlight><bold>274</bold></highlight> determines if the car door is opening. If not, a test <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> determines if the car door is closing. If not, the routine reverts to the test <highlight><bold>274</bold></highlight>. After the car door closed sensor is actuated and the car door is stopped, the next thing to occur will be the car door opening and then a pair of steps <highlight><bold>276</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>277</bold></highlight> set an opening pulse number equal to zero, and set a closed sensor flag which is used in this routine as described hereinafter. Then a subroutine <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> causes the routine to wait and eventually read an encoder pulse when one is emitted from the door position encoder. Each encoder pulse is indicative of so many degrees (or fractions of a revolution), and translates directly to distance of the door position. Thus, knowledge of the pulse count is equivalent to knowledge of the door position. At the same time, the pulse separation (referred to hereinafter as &ldquo;pulse width&rdquo;) is inversely related to the speed of the door. Each time that the encoder emits a pulse, the routine reaches a pair of steps <highlight><bold>283</bold></highlight> where the pulse width is recorded as being related to the current opening pulse number, which initially is some negative number, due to the convention established herein that pulse number zero is defined as the pulse where the door closed sensor is no longer activated (no longer indicates the door being closed). And then the opening pulse number is incremented in a step <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight>. A test <highlight><bold>288</bold></highlight> determines if the car door is still opening; in the usual case it will be so a test <highlight><bold>289</bold></highlight> determines if the car door closed sensor is actuated, or not. In the first fractions of a second when the car door begins to open, the car door closed sensor will still be actuated so an affirmative result causes the routine to revert to the subroutine <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> to read another pulse, record its width and increment the opening pulse number once again. The program will thus loop through test and steps <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>289</bold></highlight> until the car door closed sensor is no longer actuated. Then a test <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> determines if the closed sensor flag, set in step <highlight><bold>277</bold></highlight>, is still set. Initially it will be, so an affirmative result of test <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> reaches a test <highlight><bold>291</bold></highlight> to see if the opening pulse number is within two pulses of zero, which is the true door closed position and the correct position for the door closed sensor. If it is not within the desired range, then a pair of steps <highlight><bold>293</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>294</bold></highlight> store the time stamp and floor number along with a feature called &ldquo;car door position error&rdquo;, which is comprised of Parameter No. <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> (car door leaving a closed position sensor as it opens) contemporaneous with Parameter No. <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> (a true car door closed position). On the other hand, if there is no error in the door position, an affirmative result of test <highlight><bold>291</bold></highlight> will bypass steps <highlight><bold>293</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>294</bold></highlight>. Then a step <highlight><bold>295</bold></highlight> names the current pulse &ldquo;zero&rdquo; to satisfy the convention; the pulse identification of the door closed sensor position is upgraded in every pass through the routine at step <highlight><bold>295</bold></highlight>. A step <highlight><bold>296</bold></highlight> resets the closed sensor flag so that in subsequent passes through the steps and tests <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> the door closed position sensor test <highlight><bold>291</bold></highlight> will not be performed, as the door continues to open. When the car door is fully open, the test <highlight><bold>288</bold></highlight> will be negative reaching a step <highlight><bold>299</bold></highlight> which records the opening pulse number, indicative of the number of pulses which have occurred and therefore the actual open position of the car door once it ceases opening. This number is used in FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> as described hereinafter. The routine will then loop through tests <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>274</bold></highlight> until the door begins closing. Then a step <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> sets the closing pulse number equal to zero and the subroutine <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> waits to read the next encoder pulse, when it occurs. After the next encoder pulse is read, a pair of steps <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> record the pulse width in association with the closing pulse number and then the closing pulse number is incremented in a step <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>. A test <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> determines if the car door is still closing. So long as it is, the routine will read successive pulse numbers and record the pulse width. However, once the car door stops closing, a negative result of test <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> reaches a step <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> to record the closing pulse number for use in FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> A routine that checks for obstacles or other impediments that slow the door down is reached in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> through a start entry point <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>, and the routine waits at a test <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> until the end of a door open command, indicating that the process of recording pulse widths as the door opens has finished, so that this routine can begin. Then, a series of steps <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> initialize a pulse number used in the routine equal to zero, reset an obstacle flag used in the routine, and initialize the maximum severity (the severity of slowing the car door down) to zero. Pulse widths stored according to pulse number as described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> are then compared against previously determined reference pulse widths in a step <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight>. The severity of slowing down is equal to the pulse width of a particular pulse number minus the reference width for that same particular pulse number of a reference door motion profile for the particular door mode of the door when the pulse widths were recorded as described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. Then the pulse number is incremented in a step <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> and a test <highlight><bold>327</bold></highlight> determines if severity exceeds a threshold. If the car door is slowed just a small amount which is inconsequential, the extra width between pulses will be less than the threshold, so a test <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> determines if the obstacle flag (reset in step <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight>) has been set or not. Until severity exceeds the threshold, the obstacle flag will not be set, so a pair of steps <highlight><bold>329</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> reset the obstacle flag (in this case, redundantly) and reestablish maximum severity at zero, for purposes described hereinafter. Then a test <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> determines if the pulse number is high enough to indicate that the door is half open. Initially it will not be, so severity of another pulse is determined in step <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> once again. Assume now that there is a significant obstacle so that severity is greater than the threshold in test <highlight><bold>327</bold></highlight>. A test <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> determines that the obstacle flag has not yet been set, so that a step <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> will set the obstacle flag and a step <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> will set the obstacle position equal to the pulse number. Then a test <highlight><bold>337</bold></highlight> determines if the severity sensed in step <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> exceeds the previously established maximum severity; initially, any severity greater than the threshold will be higher than the zero maximum severity set in step <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>, so an affirmative result of test <highlight><bold>337</bold></highlight> will reach test <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> to set the maximum severity equal to the severity most recently set in step <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight>. Then the program reverts to step <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight>, and again the test <highlight><bold>327</bold></highlight> determines if severity is more than the threshold. Assuming there is an obstacle, there will be several pulses exceeding the threshold so affirmative results of step <highlight><bold>327</bold></highlight> will reach test <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> which now is affirmative since the obstacle flag has been set. Test <highlight><bold>337</bold></highlight> will continue to be affirmative and step <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> will continue to update the value of maximum severity until the peak of the slowdown is reached. Thereafter, severity will no longer be greater than maximum severity so a negative result of test <highlight><bold>337</bold></highlight> reaches a test <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> which determines if the current pulse number exceeds the opening pulse number (the pulse number at the point where the door stopped as described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>). In the general case, within the first half of the pulses, the pulse number will not exceed the opening pulse number so a negative result of test <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> reverts the program to the step <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, the routine will proceed through test <highlight><bold>327</bold></highlight>, test <highlight><bold>353</bold></highlight>, test <highlight><bold>337</bold></highlight> and test <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> until the severity no longer exceeds the threshold, indicating that the end of the obstacle or other impediment has been reached. Then a negative result of test <highlight><bold>327</bold></highlight> reaches test <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> which is now affirmative, so a series of steps <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight> store the time stamp and floor number, a feature called &ldquo;opening obstacle&rdquo; which is Parameter No. <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the value of the maximum severity determined in step <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight>, and the obstacle position provided by step <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight>. It should be understood that position will be determined by converting the pulse number into distance, a relationship which is fixed in any given door. After the peak of one obstacle or other impediment has been reached, and the event has been stored in steps <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight>, the obstacle flag and maximum severity are reset in steps <highlight><bold>329</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> so the system will be ready to deal with an additional obstacle, should there be one.) If the door had become stuck in the first half of its motion as it opened during the procedures described with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the test <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> would be affirmative reaching a series of steps <highlight><bold>347</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> which store the time stamp and the floor number, Parameter No. <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the feature called &ldquo;opening obstacle&rdquo;, the maximum severity and obstacle position, all as described hereinbefore. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> In the normal course, the routine will continuously pass through the step <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> looking for slow downs at test <highlight><bold>327</bold></highlight>. If the door does not get stuck during the first half of its opening movement, eventually test <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> will be affirmative causing the routine to continue in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> through a &ldquo;second half&rdquo; transfer point <highlight><bold>353</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, if the door does not open as fully as the door opened when the reference pulse widths were recorded along with the reference pulse numbers, during a previous special test, then the actual speed profile will have increasing pulse widths (denoting deceleration to a stop) at lower pulse numbers than is the case in the reference speed profile. The actual opening pulse number is indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> at <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight>, for the actual door motion profile, and the reference opening pulse number, for a particular door mode, is illustrated at <highlight><bold>355</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the second half of the routine begins with the difference, A, of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> being determined within the square brackets of a step <highlight><bold>358</bold></highlight> as the reference opening pulse number for the given door mode, minus the actual opening pulse number, to which the pulse number is added before determining the reference pulse number from which the reference width should be taken. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The remainder of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> operates in a fashion which is identical to that described with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> hereinbefore, and further description is not needed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, obstacles to the door closing are detected in a manner that is identical to opening obstacles described with respect to FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, so further description is unnecessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15, a</cross-reference> routine which provides car door open and closed position, and opening and closing speeds, is reached through a start entry point <highlight><bold>382</bold></highlight>, and the routine waits at a step <highlight><bold>383</bold></highlight> until the car door closed sensor is actuated, indicating that the car door is fully closed. Then the routine waits at step <highlight><bold>385</bold></highlight> until the car door is opening. A test <highlight><bold>386</bold></highlight> determines if the car door is required to fully open; normally it is, but it may not be, such as during nudging (after many door reversals). Then a subroutine is reached having a portion <highlight><bold>387</bold></highlight> which will get a new pulse width as soon as one is available from the subroutine <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> and a portion <highlight><bold>388</bold></highlight> which gets the current opening pulse number as soon as it is established in step <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. This is possible because both routines run at the same time, since the test <highlight><bold>274</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> as the same as the test <highlight><bold>385</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>: car door opening. Then a test <highlight><bold>389</bold></highlight> determines if the pulse width of the pulse number which is one less than the current opening pulse number has a width that exceeds a maximum; if it does, this means that the car is almost stopped. If not, the routine loop backs to test <highlight><bold>386</bold></highlight> to get another pulse width and another opening pulse number and to test the pulse width to see if it is wide enough to indicate that the car is essentially stopped. Eventually, an affirmative result of test <highlight><bold>389</bold></highlight> will reach a step <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> to set the car door open position equal to the current car door position, and a step <highlight><bold>391</bold></highlight> to set opening speed equal to the pulse width of a pulse number which is two less than the ultimate opening pulse number. The pulse width of that pulse can be converted accurately to the car door speed, and the pulse number two less than the ultimate opening pulse number is chosen since that is a final opening speed just before the car door is stopped. Next, a series of steps <highlight><bold>393</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>396</bold></highlight> store the time stamp and floor number and a feature called &ldquo;car door open position&rdquo;; Parameter No. <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, car door open position and Parameter No. <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> opening speed are also stored. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, the routine then waits until a test <highlight><bold>397</bold></highlight> indicates that the car door is closing; then a test <highlight><bold>398</bold></highlight> determines if the car door is required to close fully. If not, a test <highlight><bold>399</bold></highlight> determines if the car door is opening, which frequently happens because of passenger activation of a between door safety device, a door close button, or a hall call button. If the car door is opening, then the program reverts to the test <highlight><bold>386</bold></highlight>, as described hereinbefore. If the car door is not opening, the routine reverts to test <highlight><bold>397</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>398</bold></highlight> waiting for a full door closing operation. When that occurs, a subroutine is reached having a portion <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> to get a new pulse width and associated pulse number from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, and a portion <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> to get a new closing pulse number, also from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. Then a test <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> determines if the most recent pulse width of the pulse number which is one less than the closing pulse number is greater than a maximum value, indicative of the car door being essentially stopped, and therefore fully closed. If not, the routine loops through the test and steps <highlight><bold>398</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> until the door is closed. Then, the step <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> sets the car door closed position equal to the current car door position, and a step <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> sets the closing speed equal to the pulse width of a pulse number which is two less than the closing pulse number; this pulse width can be converted to the final closing speed of the door. A set of steps <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> store the time stamp and floor number and a feature called &ldquo;door closed position&rdquo;; Parameter No. <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, car door closed position, and Parameter No. <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, closing speed are also stored. Then the program reverts to the start state at test <highlight><bold>383</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16, a</cross-reference> routine determines if the car door has been closed with the car at a landing for a period of time, such as two seconds, or which indicates that it is unlikely that passengers are interacting with the door. Otherwise, it is determined that it is likely that passengers are interacting with the door. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, the routine is entered through a start entry point <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> and a step <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> sets the door state, which is Parameter No. <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, to indicate passengers are likely (to interact with the door). The routine then waits at test <highlight><bold>417</bold></highlight> until the car is running. Then the routine advances through tests <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> to determine if the car door is opening while the car is still running, or not. If the car stops running before the car door opens, this means that the car is being parked and passengers interacting with the door is unlikely. But if the car door starts opening while the car is still running, this means it has reached a door zone at a landing, and interaction of passengers with the door is likely. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Therefore, a step <highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight> sets the door state to indicate passengers are likely (perhaps redundantly) and the routine then waits at a test <highlight><bold>423</bold></highlight> until the doors are closed. Once the doors are closed, it is not likely that the passengers will interact with the doors, so a step <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight> initiates a timer. However, if there is a door open command, then a test <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight> will cause the routine to revert to the test <highlight><bold>423</bold></highlight>. If the car is running, a test <highlight><bold>427</bold></highlight> causes the program to revert to test <highlight><bold>423</bold></highlight>. But if both tests <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>427</bold></highlight> are negative, then a test <highlight><bold>428</bold></highlight> determines if the timer has reached two seconds or not. If not, the routine waits at tests <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>428</bold></highlight> until the timer times out. Then a step <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> sets the door state to indicate that interaction of passengers with the door is unlikely. A pair of steps <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>433</bold></highlight> determines if the car door open command appears before the car starts to run. If it does, then a step <highlight><bold>434</bold></highlight> sets the door state to indicate that the interaction of passengers with the door is likely, and the program reverts to the test <highlight><bold>423</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> However, if the car is running before there is a door open command, then the routine reverts to the test <highlight><bold>417</bold></highlight>. Thus, the door state indicates that interaction of passengers with the car door is unlikely when the car door is parked (not running) with the doors closed for a predetermined time (such as two seconds). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17, a</cross-reference> routine which determines operation and duration of operation of a between-door safety device is reached through a start entry point <highlight><bold>436</bold></highlight> and the routine then waits at a test <highlight><bold>437</bold></highlight> until the door safety device is actuated. Then a timer is initiated in a step <highlight><bold>439</bold></highlight> and the routine waits at a test <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> until the door safety device is no longer actuated. When that happens, a step <highlight><bold>441</bold></highlight> sets the safety device duration equal to the setting of the timer. Then a series of steps <highlight><bold>443</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>446</bold></highlight> store: the time stamp and floor number; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Parameter No. <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, which is the feature known as &ldquo;door safety device&rdquo;; Parameter No. <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, the safety device duration; and Parameter No. <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, the door state which is established in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. Then the program reverts to the start state at the test <highlight><bold>437</bold></highlight>. When dealing with hall call buttons and lights and car call buttons and lights, it should be borne in mind that the landing related thereto is different from the floor number (which is generally recorded in most of the routines hereinbefore) because the landing number relates to the floor for which a call is being entered, whereas the floor number relates to the position of the elevator car.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Routines that similarly sense operation of a door open button or a door close button, and the duration that the buttons are operated, are set forth in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</cross-reference>; because these routines operate exactly as described with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, except relating to the door buttons, further description is not required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> A routine for recognizing stuck hall call buttons (also called landing call buttons herein) is reached in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> through a start entry point <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight> and a first step <highlight><bold>473</bold></highlight> sets a landing counter value, L, equal to one. A test <highlight><bold>475</bold></highlight> determines if a hall call button for landing L is pressed; if it is, a step <highlight><bold>476</bold></highlight> initiates a timer and then the routine waits at tests <highlight><bold>478</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>479</bold></highlight> until either the hall call button is released or 20 minutes have expired. Then a step <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight> sets the landing number equal to L and a step <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> sets the duration for landing L to the setting of the timer. A pair of steps <highlight><bold>484</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>485</bold></highlight> store the time stamp and floor number as well as Parameter No. <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, a feature called &ldquo;hall call button&rdquo;. Then Parameter No. <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, the duration for landing L, and the landing number are stored by steps <highlight><bold>486</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>487</bold></highlight>. Then a test <highlight><bold>489</bold></highlight> determines if all of the landings in the building have had their hall call buttons tested or not; initially, they will not so a negative result of test <highlight><bold>489</bold></highlight> reaches a step <highlight><bold>490</bold></highlight> to increment L, and the routine repeats for the next landing in turn. If on the other hand, the hall call button for landing L had not been pressed in the first instance, a negative result of test <highlight><bold>475</bold></highlight> will have bypassed steps and tests <highlight><bold>476</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>487</bold></highlight>. When all landings have been tested, an affirmative result of test <highlight><bold>489</bold></highlight> causes the routine to revert to the start state at step <highlight><bold>473</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The routine of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> which determines operation and duration of car call buttons operates identically to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>, and further description is not required. However, it should be understood that both Parameter No. <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and Parameter No. <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> relate to either a hall call (landing call) button or a car call button. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22, a</cross-reference> routine for determining the occurrence and duration of hall call (landing call) button lights being lit is reached through a start entry point <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight> and a first test determines if a hall call is registered for the first landing <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>. If not, a test <highlight><bold>509</bold></highlight> determines if a timer has already been set, or if it still equals zero. If it still equals zero, then the routine advances to a test <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> related to the hall call for the second landing. However, if a hall call is registered for the first landing, then a test <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight> determines whether the timer has been initiated or not. If it has not, it will still be set to zero so an affirmative result of test <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight> reaches a step <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> to initiate timer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which will time the hall call signal on the first landing. Then the program advances to the next test <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> relating to the second landing. Then the program will deal with hall calls on all of the landings, after which it reverts to the test <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>. If the hall call is still registered, then test <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight> will be reached, but this time it will be negative since the timer was initiated and no longer is resting on zero. The routine will once again pass through tests for hall calls on each of the landings and again revert to the test <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>. Assuming now that the hall call has terminated, a negative result of test <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> reaches step <highlight><bold>509</bold></highlight> which this time is negative, thereby reaching steps <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight> to set the duration for landing one equal to timer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, to reset timer one to zero so it will be ready for a subsequent operation of the hall call button, and to set the landing (related to this feature) equal to 1. Then, a step <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight> will store Parameter Nos. <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> (because these parameters relate both to hall call lights and car call lights), which is a feature called hall call lights. A step <highlight><bold>519</bold></highlight> stores Parameter No. <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, the duration of the hall call at the first landing, and a step <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> stores the landing number established in step <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> And then the routine reaches the step <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> to make similar tests and perform similar steps. Since the remainder of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> operates as described with respect to steps and tests <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>, further description is not required. Similarly, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>, relating to car calls, operates in a fashion identical to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> and further description is not required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> A routine which detects door reversals is reached in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference> through a start entry point <highlight><bold>575</bold></highlight>, and the routine waits at a test <highlight><bold>576</bold></highlight> until there is a door close command, because door reversals only occur when the door is closing. Then a test <highlight><bold>578</bold></highlight> determines if the door open button has been pressed. If so, a step <highlight><bold>579</bold></highlight> initiates a timer and then the routine loops through tests <highlight><bold>581</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>582</bold></highlight> until either the timer exceeds one-half second, or there is a door open command. If there is no door open command within one-half second, this means that, despite pressing the door open button, a door reversal will not occur. This circumstance can happen when the door is in a nudging mode, in which the door is being forcibly closed at a very low speed. In the usual case, pressing the door open button, activation of a between-door safety device, or pressing a landing call (hall call) button, will result in a door open command to effect a door reversal. This will come well within one-half second so that an affirmative result of test <highlight><bold>582</bold></highlight> will reach a pair of steps <highlight><bold>583</bold></highlight> which store the time stamp and floor number and Parameter No. <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, a feature called &ldquo;door reversal&rdquo;. If the door open button has not been pressed, a test <highlight><bold>586</bold></highlight> determines if the between-door safety device has been activated; if so, the routine is as described hereinbefore; if not, hall call buttons and elevator floor positions are tested in tests <highlight><bold>588</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>595</bold></highlight> to see if the door should be reversed due to a hall call; if so, the routine is as described hereinbefore. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The routine in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference> accumulates the total distance which the elevator car has traveled. The routine is reached through a start entry point <highlight><bold>597</bold></highlight> and then waits at tests <highlight><bold>598</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>599</bold></highlight> until the car is within a door zone with the car not running, that is, with the car stopped. Then it waits at a test <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> until the car runs again, and a step <highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight> sets a start position equal to the present car position; then the routine waits at a test <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight> until the car is stopped once again. Then a step <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> sets the car distance equal to the absolute value of the present car position minus the start position. A series of steps <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> store the time stamp and floor number, a feature called &ldquo;travel distance&rdquo; and Parameter No. <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, car distance. Then the routine reverts to the step <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> to wait until the car runs once again. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The invention is in auditing the elevator to provide maintenance messages, and then providing maintenance indicated by those messages.

<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> (D) Another maintenance message is to adjust the position of the landing door lock at any given floor. This message may be generated whenever: (a) the position of the car door as the landing door lock switch opens (Parameter No. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) is greater or less than respectively corresponding thresholds, when there is no contemporaneous maintenance message to adjust the position of the car door vane (paragraph (C), hereinbefore), or (b) the ratio of the number of times that the landing door lock switch does not close when the car door is closed (Parameter Nos. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) to the number of times that the landing door is closed at said given landing (Parameter No. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>), exceeding a related threshold, or (c) the ratio of the number of times that the landing door lock switch opens without a door open command (Parameter No. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) at a given landing to the number of times that the landing door is open (Parameter No. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) at said landing when there is no contemporaneous maintenance message to adjust the position of the car door vane (paragraph (C), hereinbefore), exceeding a related threshold. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> (E) A maintenance message to either adjust or clean the landing door lock at a given floor may be generated in response to (a) the ratio of the number of times the landing door lock switch rebounds at a floor (Parameter No. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) which occur with the speed of the car door as the landing door lock closes (Parameter No. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) in excess of a related threshold, to the number of times the landing door closes at said floor, when there is no contemporaneous maintenance message to adjust the position of the car door vane (paragraph (C), hereinbefore), being less than a related threshold, or (b) the total number of landing door operations (Parameter No. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, not shown) at said given landing being less than a related threshold, or (c) the ratio of the number of landing door lock switch rebounds (Parameter No. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) at a given landing which occur with the speed of the car door as the landing door lock switch closed (Parameter No. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) below a related threshold, to the total number of times the landing door is closed at said landing (Parameter No. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>), exceeding a related rebound threshold, or (d) the total number of landing door lock switch rebounds (Parameter No. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) exceeding a related threshold; or (e) the ratio of the number of times that the landing door lock switch is closed when the landing door is open (Parameter No. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) to the number of times the landing door is open (Parameter No. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) at a given landing, exceeding a related threshold for a small number of landings (such as less than 40% of the landings). </paragraph>

<claim-text><highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. A method of auditing the operation of an elevator system serving a plurality of landings and having (i) car guide rails and (ii) a car juxtapositioned with said rails by (iii) car rail guides, which method comprises: 
<claim-text>(A) monitoring at every landing as each is served by the elevator system, over one or more measurement spans, parameters corresponding to steps (C) and (D) selected from (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) the position of the car door when a landing door lock switch opens and (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) the total distance that the elevator car has traveled; </claim-text>
<claim-text>(B) performing at least one of the following steps (C) and (D); </claim-text>
<claim-text>(C) determining the occurrence of at least one of (a) the variation in the parameter (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) position at any given landing exceeding a first position variation threshold, for a number of different landings which exceeds a first predetermined fraction of said landings, and (b) the parameter (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) total distance exceeding a total distance threshold, and in response thereto generating a maintenance message to adjust or replace the car rail guides; </claim-text>
<claim-text>(D) determining the occurrence of the variation in the parameter (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) position at any given landing exceeding a second position threshold, for a number of different landings which is less than a second predetermined fraction of said landings, and in response thereto generating a maintenance message to adjust the side-to-side clearance of said car guide rails at any said given landing.</claim-text>
