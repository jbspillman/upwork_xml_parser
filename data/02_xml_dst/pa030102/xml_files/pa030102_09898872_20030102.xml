<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to brushes. More particularly, the invention concerns a novel hairbrush having a magnet disposed in the handle portion thereof so that the brush can be releasably secured to a metal object for ease of storage and retrieval. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Discussion of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Hair brushes having a wide variety of different configurations have been developed in the past. Typically, the common prior art brush comprises a body portion from which a multiplicity of bristles extend and an elongated handle portion that is connected to and extends outwardly from the body portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A major problem that is experienced by persons having more than one brush and particularly by professional hairdressers who use several brushes, is storage of the brushes in a manner to prevent damage to the brushes and in a way to permit the ready retrieval of the brushes from their storage area. For example, when several brushes are stored in a drawer or like storage area, the brushes tend to become entangled and the bristles can be easily damaged. Further, retrieval of a single selected brush from several brushes within such a storage area can be quite cumbersome. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is the solution to the problems discussed in the preceding paragraph that is the subject of the present invention. In this regard, the present inventor determined that the ideal manner of storage of brushes, such as hair brushes, would be to position the brushes in a compact storage area in an arrangement wherein the brushes would be separated from one another so that the bristle portion of the brushes would not touch and would not, therefore, be entangled or damaged. Additionally, the inventor reasoned that in an ideal storage arrangement, the user should be able to clearly view the several brushes and quickly and easily remove a selected brush from the storage area without having to untangle one brush from another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> With the foregoing objects in mind, the ideal solution to the prior art storage problems conceivably by the present inventor was to store the brushes in an upright position. As will be better understood from the description that follows, this unique storage arrangement is accomplished by affixing a magnet to the brush proximate the butt end of the handle. With this construction, the brushes can be arranged in a spaced-apart configuration on any ferrous metal surface with the brushes extending either upwardly or downwardly from the surface. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide a brush storage and retrieval apparatus in that includes one or more hairbrushes of novel construction, each of which comprises a magnet disposed in the handle portion thereof so that the hairbrush can be releasably secured to the ferrous metal surface of the storage base of the apparatus for ease of storage and retrieval. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Another object of the invention is to provide a hairbrush of the type described in the preceding paragraph in which each of the hairbrushes includes a body portion having a plurality of bristles extending outwardly therefrom and a handle portion within which is the magnet is mounted in a manner to permit the hairbrush to be positioned on the ferrous metal surface and releasably secured in position thereon until removal by the user of the brush. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Another object of the invention is to provide an apparatus of the class described in which several brushes can be stored in an easy, visible orientation and in a spaced-apart relationship so that the brushes can be easily seen and so that the bristles of the brushes will not become damaged or entangled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Another object of the invention is to provide an apparatus as described in the preceding paragraph in which the operator can quickly and easily remove a selected brush from the storage base without interfering with the other brushes mounted on the storage base. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Another object of the invention is to provide an apparatus as described in the preceding paragraphs which is of simple construction and one that can be easily and inexpensively manufactured.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DISCUSSION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Referring to the drawings and particularly to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, one form of the brush of the invention is there shown and generally designated by the numeral <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In this form of the invention, the brush comprises an elongated body portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> having a multiplicity of bristles <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> connected to and extending outwardly from body <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Connected to body <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is an elongated handle <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> that includes a first end <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>that is connected to body portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and a second end <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Disposed between ends <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is a gripping portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>that includes a spiral wound gripping member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Formed in end <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of handle portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is a cavity <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> that closely receives a generally cylindrically shaped magnet <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Magnet <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is a conventional, permanent magnet and includes a lower, generally planner surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Referring next to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, one form of the brush presentation apparatus of the invention is there illustrated. This brush presentation apparatus includes a ferrous metal base <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> having a generally planner surface <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Affixed to generally planner surface <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is a plurality of hairbrushes of the general character described in the preceding paragraphs. While the brushes can be of different configurations, each brush includes a body portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and a handle portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> within which is mounted a permanent magnet such as magnet <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Each of the handles <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is of the generally configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and includes a cavity within which the magnet <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is mounted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> With the construction described, several brushes can be mounted on the base <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in the manner shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> with the magnets of each of the brushes in engagement with the surface <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The magnets are of such a strength that the brushes will be securely supported on base <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in the upstanding configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. With the brushes in this upstanding configuration, it is apparent that each brush is readily visible to the user and that each brush can be quickly and easily moved from the supporting base without interference with the other brushes. When the use of a particular brush is completed, the brush can be reaffixed to the ferrous metal base in a manner to support the brush in the upright configuration until it is to be used by the operator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the brushes can also be removably affixed to a base, such as base <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, so that they hang downwardly. In this hanging configuration, each brush is also readily visible to the user and can be quickly and easily removed from the supporting base. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, brushes of various styles and shapes can be affixed to the mounting base <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> with the bristles thereof extending outwardly from the body portion of the brush in a spaced-apart relationship from the bristled portion of the adjacent brush. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Having now described the invention in detail in accordance with the requirements of the patent statutes, those skilled in this art will have no difficulty in making changes and modifications in the individual parts or their relative assembly in order to meet specific requirements or conditions. Such changes and modifications may be made without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention, as set forth in the following claims. </paragraph>
