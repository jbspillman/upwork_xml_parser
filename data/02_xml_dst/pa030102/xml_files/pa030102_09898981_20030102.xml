The following is a summary of those prior art patents most relevant to the invention at hand, as well a description outlining the differences between the features of the present invention and those of the prior art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> 1. U.S. Pat. No. 6,019,339, invented by Brayford, entitled &ldquo;Book Holder&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The patent to Brayford describes a flexible resilient book holder which permits an open book to be placed between a first and second planar surface keeping the pages on each side of the book in a relatively flat plane to permit the reader to read both pages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> 2. U.S. Pat. No. 5,829,787, invented by Newhouse, Jr., entitled &ldquo;Book Holder&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In the patent to Newhouse, Jr., a book is held on a support having a spring clip on the side. The clip is designed to hold a transparent arm extending across the open book. Depressing the clip lifts the arm, allowing a page to be turned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> 3. U.S. Pat. No. 6,045,159, invented by Bellah, entitled &ldquo;Book Holder&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The patent to Bellah describes a holder for a book, such as a paperback or hard cover book, comprising a stiff flat member creased to provide a central stationary panel corresponding to the spine of the book, and a pair of pivoted panels corresponding to the front and back of the book. A spring assembly comprises a plurality of long concave thin metal members connected together by a strip of tape and connected to the stiff flat member by a pop rivet. The ends of the springs are received by a pair of plastic sleeves which are stitched to the stiff flat member. The stiff flat member is covered by a vinyl sheet in such a way as to have a curved edge providing a radius of at least {fraction (1/16)}&Prime;. A transparent strap connects to the opposite sides of the book holder and presses open pages of the book against the flat stiff member. The curved edge prevents the transparent strap from being cut by the book holder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> 4. U.S. Pat. No. 4,014,508, invented by Weiss, entitled &ldquo;Book Holding Device&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The patent to Weiss describes a book holding device comprising a pair of rigid elongated page-retaining members secured to a book-supporting board by a pair of elastic cords which extend across the back of the board. Means are provided for restricting the horizontal movement of the cords beyond predetermined limits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> 5. U.S. Pat. No. 5,246,251, invented by Evans, entitled &ldquo;Book Holder&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The patent to Evens describes a book holder in the form of an elongate panel composed of a light, durable material, such as plastic, including a base portion and a U-shaped end at each of the opposite sides thereof. The U-shaped ends are dimensioned so as to provide an overhang for trapping the pages of a book between the overhang and the respective adjacent base portion. In a variation of the foregoing, an extensible book holder is disclosed in which the base portion now has a right base component and a left base component which are joined so as to permit a selectively extensible interaction therebetween for accommodating books of various widths with a single book holder. In operation, the user engages an open book with the book holder so that a portion of opposing sides of the book (that is, the left and right side of the book located at opposite sides of its spine) are captured by the U-shaped ends and the base portion. The U-shaped ends are dimensioned so that they do not pose a problem with comfortable reading of the pages; indeed the plastic may be clear or otherwise see-through. When it is time to turn pages, a simple finger movement is all that is necessary to remove the page being turned from the overhang on the right and to trap it under the overhang on the left (and vice versa). Paralyzed persons and persons with arthritis or other disabilities can easily turn book pages using the book holder, needing only a pencil-like tool held in their mouth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> 6. U.S. Pat. No. 6,045,107, invented by Carlson, entitled &ldquo;Holder For Reading Material&rdquo;</paragraph>

The reading material is fit through a central window of page support and the pages rest upon left wing fold and right wing fold. Wing folds have slots that enable a the user directly, or with the mouthstick, to interact with the reading material pages. The reading material is secured between a rigid rod and an elastic cord that comprises part of a securing subassembly. An interlocking endcap and an interlocking endcap enable securing subassembly to operably interact with page support. Page support is supported by an articulated swing arm subassembly, which enables reading assistive device to suspend reading material above a reclining or supine user from their bed or chair. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> 9. U.S. Pat. No. 5,165,722, invented by Wong, entitled &ldquo;Book Leaf Holder&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In the patent to Wong, a book leaf holder maintains a book in an opened position with the pages held firmly down. In a preferred form the holder comprises a single piece of wire having a curving back portion and bends at each end forming arms which extend over the opened pages and a clip-like end which maintains the arms in position. The wire device acts somewhat in the manner of a large paper clip, having an undeformed position which is essentially planar and tending to return to the planar condition when in use, tending to urge the book toward being flat. The center curving section of the device bears against the center binding behind the opened book, and in the usual manner of use the arm on each side clips over and holds down an opened page. The end finger or clip beyond the arm is inserted under a sheaf of pages, e.g. 30 or 50 pages below the opened page. The book holder clip stores flatly and is useful as a bookmark when the book is closed. Other embodiments, formed of other materials and of multiple components, are disclosed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> 10. U.S. Pat. No. 4,508,307, invented by Morales, entitled &ldquo;Foldable, Self-Supporting, Adjustable Book Holder&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In the patent to Morales, a foldable, self-supporting, adjustable book holder is disclosed having a first base member formed of an elongated base section having a planar portion which deflects at a bend into an elevated, substantially parallel elongated member wherein the elevated, elongated support member has an elongated slot formed therein which is adapted to receive an elevated boss positioned within and movable within the elongated slot, a second base member having an elongated, substantially planar support member having an elevated boss member formed at one end thereof which is adapted to be positioned into and slidable within the elongated slot, a pair of side members which are adapted to be pivotally connected to the ends of the first base member and the second base member such that the elevated boss is positioned in and is movable with the elongated slot to form a book support when in upright position and wherein the opposite ends of the side members have a plurality of axially aligned openings formed therein to receive an elongated adjustable rod member and an elongated holding and support member having a protruding lip formed at the other end thereof to form a three-point loading system to support a book. The foldable, self-supporting, adjustable book holder is adapted to be formed into a folded, compact book holder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The aforementioned prior art patents illustrate various designs intended to provide for hands-free reading. For the purposes of example, the patents to Bellah and Weiss illustrate book holders comprising a back surface on which to rest the open book, and at least one front support member to hold the book open to a particular page. However, these designs fail to teach the usage of a soft, lightweight support structure, and further fail to teach the usage of arm members with a vinyl tubing to facilitate turning of the pages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Other relevant prior art designs include: clip-board like book holder designs; book holders featuring illumination means; book holders featuring cup holders and other ancillary items; suspended book holding structures for handicapped persons; and book holders constructed of substantially rigid or heavy materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In contrast to the above, the present invention is constructed of foam, with a wire running through a back section extending from both sides to form arms. The pliable quality of the structure allows for books of a variety of sizes and thickness to fit within the book holder. Furthermore, the foam construction of the invention allows for low manufacturing costs, ease of production and shipping, and lighter overall weight of the product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Finally, unlike the prior art, the support wire is coated with a vinyl tubing or the like to prevent damage to the pages and allow the pages to turn easily. In total, the present invention allows for hands-free reading in a more effective and more convenient manner than shown in the prior art devices. </paragraph>
