<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">Methods and apparatus for moving media along a media path employ an increase in the force with which a gripping surface contacts the media in order to compensate for wear experienced by the gripping surface. The force is increased as a function of a measured variable which can be the number of revolutions of a feed roller on which the gripping surface is defined. The variable can alternatively be elapsed time, or can be a number of sheets of media that pass a given point on the media path. An apparatus in accordance with the present invention includes a wear compensator which is configured to cause the increase in force with which the gripping surface contacts the media. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention pertains to methods and apparatus for moving and handling sheet media, including plastic film and paper. More specifically, the invention pertains to methods and apparatus to compensate for performance loss in media-contacting surfaces in imaging devices, such as printers and copiers, due to wear of such surfaces. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Many various types of prior art imaging devices are known. Imaging devices are employed to produce visual images on sheets of media. Media is typically in the form of paper, but can also be in other forms such as plastic transparencies. Imaging devices include printers, copiers, facsimile machines, and the like. That is, imaging devices include any type of device which is configured to produce a visual image on a sheet of media. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Prior art imaging devices often employ feed mechanisms which are configured to feed, or move, sheets of media through the imaging device. For example, a feed mechanism is often employed to pick sheets of media, one-at-a-time, from a stack of media in order to feed individual sheets of media into an imaging device. The feed mechanism, or other feed mechanisms, can be employed to feed the individual sheets of media through the imaging device as images are applied to the sheets of media, or as other such processes are performed on the sheets of media. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Feed mechanisms generally comprise rollers or the like for moving the sheets of media through the imaging device. The feed mechanisms also generally comprise various drive components which are configured to drive the rollers so as to impart rotation thereto. Feed mechanisms, then, include any components which are configured to facilitate the movement of sheets of media through the imaging device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Feed mechanisms typically comprise gripping surfaces which are configured to contact and grip the sheets of media in order to facilitate the movement of the sheets of media through the imaging device. The gripping surfaces are often defined on the outer cylindrical surfaces of the rollers which make up the feed mechanisms. An example of a gripping surface is a relatively soft rubber coating on the roller. The rubber coating is preferably sufficiently soft so as to facilitate a relatively high static frictional force between the roller and the sheets of media. However, the rubber coating is also preferably not so soft as to leave a visible deposit or marking on the sheets of media as they are moved into and through the imaging device by the roller, or rollers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> As the prior art imaging devices are operated, the gripping surfaces tend to experience wear. This wear can be due to abrasion and the like from repeated contact with sheets of media as the media is moved by the gripping surfaces. The wear experienced by the gripping surfaces can cause problems with the operation of the feed mechanisms. In particular, the wear of the gripping surfaces can cause slippage of the gripping surfaces relative to the sheets of media. Such slippage and the like can, in turn, result in media jams and mis-feeds, as well as multiple media picks and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> What is needed then, are methods and apparatus for feeding media which achieve the benefits to be derived from similar prior art devices, but which avoid the shortcomings and detriments individually associated therewith. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The invention includes methods and apparatus for feeding, or moving, media along a media path. The apparatus can be employed, for example, in conjunction with an imaging device to move media along a media path which passes through the imaging device. A gripping surface is employed to contact, and thereby move, the media along the media path. The invention further includes methods and apparatus for increasing the force with which a gripping surface contacts the media in order to compensate for wear experienced by the gripping surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, an apparatus includes a gripping surface and a wear compensator configured to selectively increase the force with which the gripping surface contacts the media. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, a method includes providing a rotatable feed roller in an imaging device, the roller having a gripping surface defined thereon. The gripping surface is configured to contact and grip the media as the roller feeds sheets of media into and through the imaging device. The method also includes measuring the rotation of the feed roller and increasing the force with which the gripping surface contacts the media in response to measuring rotation of the feed roller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In accordance with yet another embodiment of the present invention, a method includes providing a gripping surface defined on a feed roller or the like which can be used in an imaging device or the like. The imaging device is configured to generate an image on a sheet of media. In the method, the media is contacted by the gripping surface. A variable is measured and the force with which the gripping surface contacts the media is increased as a function of the measured variable. The measured variable can be, for example, a number of rotations of a feed roller, or a number of sheets of media which pass a given point.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The invention includes methods and apparatus for feeding, or moving, media along a media path. The apparatus can be employed, for example, to move media along a media path which passes through an imaging device. A gripping surface is provided, which can be defined on a feed roller, for example. The gripping surface is employed to contact the media so as to move the media along the media path. In accordance with the instant invention, the force with which the gripping surface contacts the media is increased as a function of a measured variable. The measured variable is preferably the number of revolutions of the feed roller on which the gripping surface is defined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The present invention is particularly suited for use in imaging devices such as computer printers, photocopiers, facsimile machines, and other devices in which sheets of media are fed, or moved, past an imaging section so that the imaging device can generate an image on the sheets of media. Such sheets of media can include sheets of paper, envelopes, card stock, clear plastic transparencies, or other media upon which an image can be generated by an imaging device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> side elevation view is shown which depicts an apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention. The apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> comprises at least one feed roller <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> which is supported on a support &ldquo;S&rdquo; such as a chassis or frame or the like. Each of the feed rollers, such as the feed rollers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, can be configured to be driven, or made to rotate, about a respective axis of rotation <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> by a respective drive mechanism or the like <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> as shown. Alternatively, any of the feed rollers, such as the feed roller <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, can be configured to be non-driven, or free-spinning, such as roller <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. As is evident, the feed rollers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> are configured to rotate in respective directions as indicated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> However, it is understood that the feed rollers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> can be, in accordance with the instant invention, configured in alternate manners with respect to the configurations of the rollers described herein and shown in the accompanying figures. For example, the roller <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> can be configured in the manner of a retard roller, or back roller, which is driven in a direction opposite from that indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> by way of an overload clutch (not shown) or the like. Such a retard roller configuration is intended to prevent two sheets of media &ldquo;M&rdquo; from passing between the pair of rollers <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> at the same time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In the case wherein two sheets of media &ldquo;M&rdquo; are sandwiched between the pair of rollers <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> at the same time, the retard roller (for example, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>) grips one of the sheets while the retard roller is driven in a direction opposite of the direction indicated so as to move the sheet in a direction opposite the direction of the media path &ldquo;P.&rdquo; This occurs while the other sheet is moved by the roller <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> in the direction of the media path &ldquo;P.&rdquo; That is, the frictional force between the two sheets of media is generally lower than the frictional force between each of the sheets and the respective contacting roller <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, in the case wherein only a single sheet of media &ldquo;M&rdquo; is sandwiched between the pair of rollers <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, the overload clutch (not shown) can be overcome by the force of the driven roller <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, which results in the retard roller (for example <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>) turning in the direction indicated. Such retard roller configurations are known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The drive mechanism <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> can comprise, for example, an electric motor or the like which is mechanically linked to the respective feed roller <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The drive mechanism <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> can alternatively comprise only a linkage which connects the respective feed roller <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to a mechanical power source (not shown) which is configured to drive several feed rollers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, as well as other components of the apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. It is understood that the means for driving the feed rollers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> (and <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, if driven), is well known in the art and that such means need not be discussed further herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The feed rollers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> can have any of a number of possible shapes. For example, as is shown, one of the feed rollers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> can be in the form of a cylinder having a substantially &ldquo;D&rdquo;-shaped cross-section. This type of feed roller <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> can be particularly useful when employed as a &ldquo;pick roller&rdquo; which is configured to intermittently pick single sheets of media from the top of a stack of sheets of media &ldquo;M.&rdquo; As a further example, at least one of the feed rollers <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> can be in the form of a cylinder having a substantially circular cross-section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Further examination of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> will reveal that a gripping surface <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is defined on each of the feed rollers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. It is understood that the respective gripping surfaces <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> can be integral with the respective roller <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, or can alternatively be a separate coating or layer as depicted. The gripping surfaces <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> of each of the rollers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> are configured to contact and grip sheets of media &ldquo;M&rdquo; as the media is fed along the media path &ldquo;P&rdquo; as shown. The gripping surfaces <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> are preferably fabricated from a relatively soft material, such as rubber or the like, and preferably have a tread pattern or the like defined therein so as to facilitate the gripping of media &ldquo;M&rdquo; for the movement thereof. It is understood that such gripping surfaces are well known in the art and that the configuration of the gripping surfaces need not be discussed in further detail herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Resilient members <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> such as springs or the like can be employed to assist in biasing the respective gripping surfaces <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> against the sheets of media &ldquo;M&rdquo; as the media is moved along the media path &ldquo;P&rdquo; by the feed rollers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. For example, a pair of opposing feed rollers <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> can be biased against one another by the action of a respective resilient member <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> as shown. Thus, as the sheets of media &ldquo;M&rdquo; pass between the opposing feed rollers <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, the respective gripping surfaces <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> can be forced against the media by the action of the biasing member <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. Although the resilient members <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> are depicted as coil springs in the accompanying figures, it is understood that when I say &ldquo;resilient member&rdquo; I mean any device which is configured to store mechanical energy. Thus, resilient members <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> can include any type of mechanical spring, pneumatic spring, or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> It is also understood that when I say &ldquo;feed roller&rdquo; I mean to include any object on which a gripping surface <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is defined, wherein the gripping surface is configured to grip a sheet of media &ldquo;M&rdquo; so as to move the media along a media path. Thus, a feed roller can comprise, for example, a flat, non-rotatable member (not shown) which has a gripping surface defined thereon. Furthermore, it is understood that any apparatus in accordance with the present invention can be employed alone or in conjunction with other devices, including imaging devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> As is shown, another resilient member <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> can be employed to bias a lift plate &ldquo;L&rdquo; toward a respective feed roller <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The lift plate &ldquo;L&rdquo; is configured to support thereon one or more media sheets &ldquo;M.&rdquo; As the respective resilient member <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> biases the lift plate &ldquo;L&rdquo; toward the respective feed roller <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the top of the stack of media &ldquo;M&rdquo; is biased against the gripping surface <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> of the respective feed roller. As is evident, the respective gripping surfaces <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> are biased against the sheets of media &ldquo;M&rdquo; in order to develop the required frictional forces there between for gripping and moving the sheets of media along the media path &ldquo;P.&rdquo; Alternatively, the resilient members <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> can be omitted from the apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> as will be discussed below in greater detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> comprises at least one wear compensator <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. Each wear compensator <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> can be connected between a respective feed roller <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and the support &ldquo;S&rdquo; as shown. However, it is understood that, although not depicted in the accompanying figures, the wear compensators <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> can be connected between, for example, the support &ldquo;S&rdquo; and components other than the feed rollers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. For example, the wear compensator <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> can alternatively be connected between the support &ldquo;S&rdquo; and the lift plate &ldquo;L.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> As will become apparent in later discussion, the intended function of the wear compensators <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is to compensate for the wear on the gripping surfaces <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. Such wear on the gripping surfaces <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> occurs over the operational life thereof as a result of abrasion and the like as discussed above. The wear compensators <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> perform the intended function thereof by increasing the force of the respective feed roller <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> against the media sheets &ldquo;M&rdquo; as the respective gripping surface <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> experiences wear. Thus, the wear compensator <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> can be positioned with respect to, and connected between, any components of the apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> so as to cause an increase in force of the respective gripping surface <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> against the media &ldquo;M.&rdquo; The configuration and function of the wear compensators <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> will be discussed in greater detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can also comprise a counting device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> which can be supported on the support &ldquo;S&rdquo; and which is preferably configured to measure the rotation of at least one feed roller, such as the feed roller <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> as shown. For example, the counting device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> can be in the form of a sensor or the like which detects a trigger mark &ldquo;T&rdquo; which is mounted on the respective feed roller <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. That is, as the trigger mark &ldquo;T&rdquo; passes the counting device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> during rotation of the respective feed roller <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, the counting device can detect such passing of the target during each revolution of the feed roller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In this manner, the counting device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> can count the number of revolutions made by the respective feed roller <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> during rotation thereof. The counting device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is preferably configured to transmit a signal which contains information regarding the number of revolutions of the respective feed roller <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. It is understood that the counting device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> can be configured to measure the rotation of any of the feed rollers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The trigger mark &ldquo;T&rdquo; can be anything that is configured to trigger, or be detected by, the counting device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. For example, the trigger mark &ldquo;T&rdquo; can comprise a magnet, wherein the counting device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> can comprise a coil or the like which is configured to detect the passing magnet as the respective feed roller <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> rotates. As another example, the trigger mark &ldquo;T&rdquo; can comprise a light-reflective surface such as a mirror or the like, wherein the counting device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> can comprise a light source, such as an LED, and a light detector, such as a photo-electric cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In such a configuration, the counting device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> can detect the passing light-reflective surface as the respective feed roller <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> rotates. The purpose of the counting device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> will be discussed in greater detail below. It is understood that such detection means which are configured to measure rotation are known in the art and that many various configurations are possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> As is further seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> preferably comprises a controller <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> which is in signal communication with both the counting device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and the wear compensators <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> as shown. The controller <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> can comprise a processor (not shown) or the like, as well as a memory (not shown). The purpose of the controller is to control and coordinate the operational aspects of the apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. For example, the controller <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> can be configured to receive signals from the counting device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. That is, the counting device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is preferably configured to send a signal to the controller <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> each time the counting device detects the passage of the trigger mark &ldquo;T.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In this manner, the controller <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> can track the number of revolutions made by the respective feed roller <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The controller <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> can also contain a sequence of computer-executable steps <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> for controlling the wear compensators <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> in response to the number of revolutions of the respective feed roller <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> as counted by the counting device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. The function and operation of the controller <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> as well as the computer-executable steps <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> will be discussed in greater detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Moving now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> schematic diagram is shown of an apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> which is configured similarly to the apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> which is depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. For example, the apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> comprises the controller <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, the lift plate &ldquo;L,&rdquo; the counting device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, the resilient member <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>, the feed roller <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, and the gripping surface <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> of the apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). The aforementioned components (<highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, &ldquo;L,&rdquo; <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>) are configured to function in the respective manners as described above in conjunction with the description of the apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). The diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is primarily intended to depict one of many possible alternative configurations of the wear compensator <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> of the apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). As will be discussed below, other configurations wear compensators are possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> As is seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the wear compensator <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> comprises a camming surface <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight>, such as a threaded rod or the like as shown. The wear compensator <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> also comprises a cam follower <highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight> such as a threaded collar or the like as shown. The camming surface <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> is preferably fixedly connected to a yoke <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> which, in turn, supports the roller <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. That is, as shown, the camming surface <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> does not move with respect to the yoke <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. The camming surface <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> is engaged with the cam follower <highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight> as shown. That is, the wear compensator <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> can be configured as a jack screw or the like in the case wherein the camming surface <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> is a threaded rod, and wherein the cam follower <highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight> is a threaded collar which is threaded onto the threaded rod. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> It is understood that the camming surface <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> and the cam follower <highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight> can be configured in any manner which allows the wear compensator <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> to function as intended. That is, the camming surface <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> and the cam follower <highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight> can be configured in any manner in accordance with which movement of the camming surface and the cam follower against each other results in an increase in force with which the gripping surface <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> contacts the media &ldquo;M.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> As is seen, the follower <highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight> is preferably supported by a base <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>. A motive power source <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> is connected to the cam follower <highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight>. The power source <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> is configured to selectively rotate the cam follower <highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight> so as to move the camming surface <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> in the direction &ldquo;D.&rdquo; That is, the cam follower <highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight> can be rotated with respect to the camming surface <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> so as to cause the camming surface to move in the direction &ldquo;D&rdquo; which is substantially parallel to an axis (not shown) which is defined by the camming surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> It is understood that the respective roles of the camming surface <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> and the cam follower <highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight> can be reversed in an alternative configuration which is not depicted in the accompanying figures. That is, alternatively, the camming surface <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> can be rotatably mounted to the yoke so as to be driven by the motive power source <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight>, while the cam follower <highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight> is alternatively fixedly mounted on the base <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> and engaged with the camming surface. In such an alternative configuration, the rotation of the camming surface <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> causes an increase in the force with which the gripping surface <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> contacts the media &ldquo;M.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The motive power source <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> can be, for example, a small stepper motor or the like which is in signal communication with the controller <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> as shown. The controller <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> is also preferably in signal communication with the counting device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> as shown. During operation of the apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the counting device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> counts the number of revolutions of the feed roller <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The counting device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> can send signals to the controller to notify the controller of the number of revolutions made by the feed roller <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> preferably comprises a series of computer-executable steps <highlight><bold>281</bold></highlight> which can be executed by the controller <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. The computer-executable steps <highlight><bold>281</bold></highlight> are preferably configured to control the operation of the power source <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> as a function of the number of revolutions of the feed roller <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, as counted by the counting device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. That is, the power source <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> is preferably selectively operated by the controller <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> so as to cause the camming surface <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> to incrementally move in the direction &ldquo;D&rdquo; as a function of the number of rotations made by the feed roller <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Since, typically, relatively minor adjustments will be made to the position of the camming surface <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> as a function of the number of rotations of the feed roller <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, the force-increasing algorithm comprising steps <highlight><bold>281</bold></highlight> can be configured to actuate the stepper motor <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> only after a predetermined number of rotations of the feed roller have occurred. For example, the steps <highlight><bold>281</bold></highlight> can be configured to incrementally actuate the stepper motor <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> after each group of 500 revolutions of the feed roller <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> (which can correspond, for example, to approximately 100 sheets of media &ldquo;M,&rdquo; depending on the diameter of the roller relative to the length of a sheet of media). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The movement of the camming surface <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> in the direction &ldquo;D&rdquo; causes the feed roller <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to also move in the direction &ldquo;D&rdquo; which, in turn, causes the resilient member <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> to compress. The compression of the resilient member <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> results in an increase in force of the feed roller <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> against the media &ldquo;M&rdquo; due to the compression of the resilient member <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. The increase in the force with which the feed roller <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> presses against the media &ldquo;M&rdquo; acts to compensate for wear experienced by the gripping surface <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> over time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> That is, as the gripping surface <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> wears, the apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> compensates for such wear by increasing the force with which the feed roller <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, and thus the gripping surface <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, presses against the media &ldquo;M.&rdquo; The increase in this force is a function of the rotation of the feed roller <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. As is seen, the increase in force with which the gripping surface <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> presses against the media &ldquo;M&rdquo; is accomplished in conjunction with a resilient member <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>, wherein the respective feed roller <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is moved in the direction &ldquo;D&rdquo; so as to compress the resilient member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> As an alternative to basing the increase in force with which the gripping surface <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> presses against the media &ldquo;M&rdquo; on the number of revolutions of the respective feed roller <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, the increase in force can be based on a different variable. That is, the controller <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> can be configured to receive a signal from a signal generator <highlight><bold>285</bold></highlight>, in which case the counting device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and trigger mark &ldquo;T&rdquo; can be omitted from the apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The signal generator <highlight><bold>285</bold></highlight> is preferably configured to measure a variable and to send a signal to the controller <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, wherein the signal contains data regarding the measured variable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The signal generator <highlight><bold>285</bold></highlight> can be any of a number of devices including a timer, wherein the variable measured by the signal generator is elapsed time. Thus, in such a case, the computer-executable steps <highlight><bold>281</bold></highlight> of the controller <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> can be configured to cause the wear compensator <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> to operate as otherwise discussed above, except that the operation of the wear compensator is based on elapsed time rather than a number of revolutions of the respective feed roller <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The elapsed time can be, for example, the operating time of an imaging device (not shown) in which the apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is installed. The signal generator <highlight><bold>285</bold></highlight> can also be, for example, a portion of an imaging device (not shown), wherein the signal generator measures the number of images produced by the imaging device. In such a case, the operation of the wear compensator <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is based on the number of images generated by the imaging device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> As yet a further alternative to the configuration of the apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the counting device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> can be configured to count sheets of media &ldquo;M,&rdquo; or to measure lengths of media. In such a case, the operation of the wear compensator <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, and thus, the increase of the force of the gripping surface <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> against the media, is based on the number of sheets of media &ldquo;M&rdquo; which pass the counting device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, or on the quantity of measured length of media which passes the counting device, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In other words, it is understood that the operation of the wear compensator <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> can be based on any variable that can be measured, wherein the variable is indicative of the likely wear of the gripping surface <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. Preferably, however, the variable is the number of revolutions of the respective feed roller <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> as measured by the counting device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. This is because the number of revolutions of the feed roller <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> can provide the most accurate indication of the wear experienced by the gripping surface <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Moving now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> schematic diagram is shown which depicts an apparatus <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> in accordance with yet another embodiment of the present invention. The apparatus <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is configured in a manner which is similar to that of the apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) except as noted below. That is, the apparatus <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> comprises the controller <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, the counting device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, the yoke <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, the feed roller <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, and the gripping surface <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> which are all configured to function in respective manners as described above for <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The apparatus <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> can also include the signal generator <highlight><bold>285</bold></highlight> which is also configured to function in the manner of which is described above for the signal generator in conjunction with the description of the apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> As is evident from a study of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the apparatus <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> also comprises a lift plate &ldquo;L&rdquo; which is configured so that the lift plate &ldquo;L&rdquo; is substantially rigidly mounted to a support &ldquo;S&rdquo; rather than supported by a resilient member <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. As further revealed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the apparatus <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> comprises a wear compensator <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> which is in the form of an actuator. When I say &ldquo;actuator&rdquo; I mean a device which is configured to be connected between two objects, and which is configured to apply a selectively variable force between the two objects. The primary purpose of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is to depict yet another alternative configuration of the wear compensator <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> of the apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> which is depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> As a study of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> reveals, the wear compensator <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> of the apparatus <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> can be a fluid-powered actuator which is configured as a pneumatic cylinder, a hydraulic cylinder, or the like. When I say &ldquo;fluid-powered actuator&rdquo; I mean an actuator which is configured to actuate by way of pressurized fluid which can include pressurized liquid or pressurized gas. That is, the compensator <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> can comprise a piston/piston rod assembly <highlight><bold>355</bold></highlight> which is slidably disposed within a cylinder <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The apparatus <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> preferably comprises a pressure source <highlight><bold>357</bold></highlight> such as a fluid pump, pressure tank, pressure accumulator. or the like. The apparatus <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> can also include a pressure regulator (not shown) or the like which is connected between the pressure source <highlight><bold>357</bold></highlight> and the wear compensator <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>. The pressure source <highlight><bold>357</bold></highlight> is configured to selectively apply a variable pressure (for example, by way of the pressure regulator) to the interior of the cylinder <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight> so as to produce a selectively variable force &ldquo;F&rdquo; substantially in the direction shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> During operation of the apparatus <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, the counting device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> preferably counts the revolutions made by the feed roller <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The counting device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> sends signals to the controller <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> so as to notify the controller of the number of revolutions made by the feed roller <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. As is seen, a series of computer-executable steps <highlight><bold>381</bold></highlight> can be included in the apparatus <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. The computer-executable steps <highlight><bold>381</bold></highlight> are preferably configured to cause the pressure source <highlight><bold>357</bold></highlight> to incrementally deliver increases in pressure to the cylinder <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight> as a function of the number of revolutions made by the respective feed roller <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The increases in pressure delivered by the pressure source <highlight><bold>357</bold></highlight> to the cylinder <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight> cause an increase in force &ldquo;F&rdquo; of the gripping surface <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> against the media &ldquo;M&rdquo; as the media is moved along the media path &ldquo;P.&rdquo; It is noted that the respective feed roller <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> need not be moved toward the media &ldquo;M&rdquo; in order to achieve and increase in force of the gripping surface <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> against the media. The increase in force &ldquo;F&rdquo; of the gripping surface <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> against the media &ldquo;M&rdquo; serves to compensate for wear experienced by the gripping surface. As is evident by the inclusion of the signal generating device <highlight><bold>285</bold></highlight>, as shown, it is understood that the operation of the wear compensator <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> can be alternatively based on any measured variable, as discussed above with regard to the apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>), wherein the variable is indicative of wear experienced by the gripping surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Moving now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> schematic diagram is shown which depicts the apparatus <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> with an alternative embodiment of a wear compensator <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight>. As is evident, the apparatus <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> which is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is configured in a manner substantially identical to the configuration which is depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> with the exception of the wear compensator <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight>. Specifically, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the wear compensator <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> can be configured in the manner of an electrical solenoid rather than the manner of an actuator as depicted in FIG. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the wear compensator <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> can comprise a plunger <highlight><bold>458</bold></highlight> which is slidably disposed within a coil assembly <highlight><bold>459</bold></highlight>. The plunger <highlight><bold>458</bold></highlight> is preferably fabricated from a material comprising Iron so as to be affected by a magnetic field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The coil assembly <highlight><bold>459</bold></highlight> is preferably electrically connected to an electrical power supply &ldquo;E.&rdquo; The electrical power supply &ldquo;E&rdquo; is preferably configured to provide selectively variable amounts of electrical power to the coil assembly <highlight><bold>459</bold></highlight> so as to exert a selectively variable amount of force &ldquo;F&rdquo; on the plunger <highlight><bold>458</bold></highlight> by way of an electro-magnetic field produced by electrical energy circulating in the coil assembly <highlight><bold>459</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> For example, the electrical power supply &ldquo;E&rdquo; can be configured to selectively supply a variable amount of electrical current to the coil assembly as controlled by the controller <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. The current supplied to the coil assembly can induce a selectively variable electromagnetic field which exerts a selectively variable force &ldquo;F&rdquo; on the plunger <highlight><bold>458</bold></highlight>. The force &ldquo;F&rdquo; produced as a result of the electromagnetic field can serve to cause the respective feed roller <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, by way of the yoke <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, to press the gripping surface <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> against the media &ldquo;M&rdquo; as the media is moved along the media path &ldquo;P.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> As is apparent from a study of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, while the apparatus <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is in operation, the counting device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> can count the number of revolutions made by the respective feed roller <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> as the media &ldquo;M&rdquo; is moved along the media path &ldquo;P.&rdquo; The counting device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> can send signals to the controller <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> to notify the controller of the number of revolutions made by the respective feed roller <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. As is indicated by the inclusion of the signal generator <highlight><bold>285</bold></highlight>, the controller <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> can alternatively receive signals containing variables such as elapsed time and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> As is seen, the apparatus <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> can include a series of computer-executable steps <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight>. The computer-executable steps <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> can control the operation of the electrical power supply &ldquo;E&rdquo; so as to vary the amount of electrical power supplied to the wear compensator <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> as a function of the number of revolutions of the feed roller <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> as counted by the counting device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. As mentioned above, the amount of electrical power supplied to the wear compensator <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> can alternatively be a function of another variable such as elapsed time or a number of sheets of media &ldquo;M&rdquo; which pass along the media path &ldquo;P.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In this manner, the controller <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> can cause an increase in the force &ldquo;F&rdquo; of the gripping surface <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> against the media &ldquo;M&rdquo; as a function of the number of revolutions made by the feed roller <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, or other variable which is indicative of the wear experienced by the gripping surface <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. That is, as the respective feed roller <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> rotates, the gripping surface <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> experiences wear due to abrasion and the like. The counting device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, in conjunction with the controller <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, counts the number of revolutions made by the feed roller <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In response to the increasing number of revolutions made by the feed roller <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, the controller <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> causes, by way of the wear compensator <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight>, an increase in force of the gripping surface <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> against the media &ldquo;M.&rdquo; The increase in force &ldquo;F&rdquo; can serve to compensate for the wear experienced by the gripping surface <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. As discussed above, it is understood that the operation of the wear compensator <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> can be alternatively based on any measured variable related to actual or anticipated wear of the gripping surface <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> such as elapsed time, or a number of sheets of media &ldquo;M&rdquo; which pass along the media path &ldquo;P.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Moving now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> schematic diagram is shown which depicts an alternative configuration of the apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> which is depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. As is evident, the apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> can be configured in a manner which is substantially identical to that of the apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Specifically, the apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> which is depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is identical to the apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> which is depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, except that the controller <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, the counting device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, and the motive power source <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> have been omitted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, and a gear box <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight> has been added to the apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> As is seen, the gear box <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight> has an input connection <highlight><bold>571</bold></highlight> and an output connection <highlight><bold>572</bold></highlight>. The input connection <highlight><bold>571</bold></highlight> is mechanically linked to the feed roller <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, while the output connection <highlight><bold>572</bold></highlight> is mechanically linked to the cam follower <highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight> of the wear compensator <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. In operation, the feed roller <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is rotated in the direction indicated by way of a drive mechanism <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) or the like. The rotation of the feed roller <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> causes the input connection <highlight><bold>571</bold></highlight> to rotate. The rotation of the input connection <highlight><bold>571</bold></highlight> is reduced by the gear box <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight>, wherein the output connection <highlight><bold>572</bold></highlight> is caused to rotate at a significantly slower rate than the input connection. The rotation of the output connection <highlight><bold>572</bold></highlight> causes a rotation of the cam follower <highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight> which, in turn, causes movement of the camming surface <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> in the direction &ldquo;D.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> As the camming surface <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> is caused to move in the direction &ldquo;D,&rdquo; the feed roller <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is also moved in the direction &ldquo;D&rdquo; so as to cause the resilient member <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> to become compressed. Such a compression of the resilient member <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> causes an increase in the force with which the gripping surface <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> presses against the media &ldquo;M&rdquo; as the media is moved along the media path &ldquo;P.&rdquo; As discussed above, such an increase in force with which the gripping surface <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> presses against the media &ldquo;M&rdquo; can serve to compensate for wear experienced by the gripping surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the gear box <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight> can be configured as a drive mechanism having a first output connection <highlight><bold>571</bold></highlight> and a second output connection <highlight><bold>572</bold></highlight>. That is, in the alternative, the gear box <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight> can be configured to drive both the respective feed roller <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> as well as the cam follower <highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight> by way of the first output connection <highlight><bold>571</bold></highlight> and the second output connection <highlight><bold>572</bold></highlight>, respectively. In such a case, the first output connection <highlight><bold>571</bold></highlight> is preferably configured to turn considerably faster than the second output connection <highlight><bold>572</bold></highlight> because the cam follower <highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight> preferably turns substantially more slowly than the feed roller <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> as well as <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, it is understood that the lift plate &ldquo;L&rdquo; of the apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can be replaced by a second feed roller as is illustrated by the pair of opposing feed rollers <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> which are depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. It is further understood from a study of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 5</cross-reference> that the resilient member <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> of the apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can be alternatively located between the wear compensator <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> and the feed roller <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, wherein such a case the lift plate &ldquo;L&rdquo; is preferably rigidly supported on the respective support &ldquo;S.&rdquo;In this case, the movement of the camming surface <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> in the direction &ldquo;D&rdquo; causes the resilient member <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> to compress between the camming surface and the feed roller <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, thus causing an increase in the force with which the roller is pressed against the media Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, it is understood that the lift plate &ldquo;L&rdquo; of the apparatus <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> can be replaced by a second feed roller as is illustrated by the pair of opposing feed rollers <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> which are depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. It is equally understood that the respective wear compensator <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> of the apparatus <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> can be employed in conjunction with a resilient member as in the manner of the resilient member <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> which is employed in conjunction with the wear compensator of the apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> as is described above for <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> It is further understood that, rather than counting the number of revolutions of the respective feed roller <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, the apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> of the present invention can be configured to count the number of sheets of media &ldquo;M&rdquo; which are fed through the respective apparatus. In this manner, the force with which the gripping surface <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> contacts the media &ldquo;M&rdquo; can be increased as a function of the number of sheets of media that are fed through the apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. That is, the respective computer-executable steps <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>281</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>381</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight> can be configured to count the number of sheets of media &ldquo;M&rdquo; which are fed through the apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and to increase the force with which the gripping surface <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> contacts the media as a function of the number of sheets of media so counted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> In accordance with still another embodiment of the present invention, a method of feeding media along a media path comprises providing a rotatable feed roller having a gripping surface defined thereon, wherein the gripping surface is configured to contact the media. The media path can be defined, for example, in an imaging device. One example of such a feed roller is the roller <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The method also includes measuring the rotation of the feed roller, and further includes increasing the force with which the gripping surface contacts the media in response to measuring rotation of the feed roller. When I say &ldquo;measuring the rotation of the feed roller&rdquo; I mean to include counting the number of revolutions of the feed roller. When I say &ldquo;in response to&rdquo; I mean to include &ldquo;as a function of.&rdquo; That is, the force with which the gripping surface contacts the media can be increased as a function of the number of revolutions made by the feed roller. One example of a device which can be used to measure the number of revolutions of the feed roller is the counting device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, which is described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The force with which the gripping surface contacts the media can be increased continuously in direct proportion to the number of revolutions made by the feed roller. Alternatively, the force with which the gripping surface contacts the media can be increased incrementally in direct proportion to the number of revolutions made by the feed roller. When I say &ldquo;increased incrementally,&rdquo; I mean increased discontinuously, wherein the increase is accomplished in predetermined incremental steps at predetermined intervals, and wherein an interval can correspond to a predetermined number of revolutions of the feed roller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The force with which the gripping surface contacts the media can be increased linearly in direct proportion to the number of revolutions made by the feed roller. Alternatively, the force with which the gripping surface contacts the media can be increased non-linearly, such as exponentially, logarithmically, or parabolically or the like. A series of computer-executable steps such as the steps <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>281</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>381</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight> can be employed in conjunction with a wear compensator, such as the compensators <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight>, to cause an increase in the force with which the gripping surface contacts the media. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a further embodiment of the present invention, a method of moving media along a media path comprises providing a gripping surface and contacting the media with the gripping surface such as the gripping surface <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> which is described above. The gripping surface can be defined, for example, on a feed roller or the like such as the feed roller <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> which is described above. The gripping surface can be a portion of an imaging device, or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The method also includes measuring a variable which has some relationship to the actual, estimated, or probable wear experienced by the gripping surface as a result of the contact between the gripping surface and the media. The variable can be, for example, elapsed time or the number of revolutions of a feed roller. The variable can also be the number of sheets of media which pass a given point on the media path. As yet another example, the variable can be the number of images which are produced by an imaging device or the like, and which contact the gripping surface. An example of a device which measures a variable is the counting device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> which is described above The method also includes increasing the force with which the gripping surface contacts the media as a function of the variable. That is, the force with which the gripping surface contacts the media can be increased in direct proportion to an increase in the measured variable. For example, if the variable is elapsed time, the force with which the gripping surface contacts the media can be increased in direct proportion to the amount of time which elapses from a given start time. Or, if the variable is the number of sheets of media which pass a given point on the media path, the force can be increased in direct proportion to the number of sheets of media which are counted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> While the above invention has been described in language more or less specific as to structural and methodical features, it is to be understood, however, that the invention is not limited to the specific features shown and described, since the means herein disclosed comprise preferred forms of putting the invention into effect. The invention is, therefore, claimed in any of its forms or modifications within the proper scope of the appended claims appropriately interpreted in accordance with the doctrine of equivalents. </paragraph>
