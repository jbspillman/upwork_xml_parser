<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Technical Field </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to a veterinary bathing station and, particularly, to such a station having an improved means for the ingress and egress of an animal to be bathed or groomed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In veterinary medicine, the traditional areas of practice are divided into large animal practice dealing with, e.g., cows and horses, and small animal practice dealing with, e.g., dogs and cats. In the discussion which follows, the expression &ldquo;small animal&rdquo; will be understood to mean, for example, a dog which is to be bathed or groomed, even if the dog in question weighs upward of 50 pounds and is of considerable size. Often, in while in the care of a veterinarian, such small animals must be washed, brushed, clipped and otherwise groomed for health and hygiene reasons. Veterinarian and professional groomers generally have specialized bathing stations for use in washing and grooming small animals. The bathing stations are often raised above the surrounding support surface, i.e., the floor of the building, to approximately waist height to make it easier to wash and groom the animal. Typically, the bathing stations have high sides to prevent splashing and to keep the animal from escaping. When washing a large dog, it is difficult to lift the dog into the washing station. Back strains or other injuries can occur if the animal is heavier than expected or if the animal begins to squirm or to resist being lifted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Thus, there is a need for an improved veterinary bathing station that is more convenient and comfortable to use with small animals such as larger dogs. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide a veterinary bathing station that is more convenient and comfortable to use and yet which is relatively economical to manufacture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the present invention to provide a veterinary bathing station which provided improved ingress and egress for a small animal such as a larger dog. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a veterinary bathing station that will reduce the risk of injury to the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The above objects are achieved by providing a veterinary bathing station including a washing stall having a bottom wall and surrounding side walls, at least one of the surrounding side walls having an opening of sufficient size to allow an animal to pass through. A plurality of leg elements are provided for elevating the bottom wall of the washing stall above a surrounding support surface a selected distance, wherein an open space is created between the bottom wall and the surrounding support surface. The stall also includes a ramp having an inclined ramp surface defined between a top end and a bottom end of the ramp for allowing ingress and egress of an animal from the surrounding support surface through the wall opening without the necessity of lifting the animal. A rotatable coupling attaches the top end of the ramp to the bottom wall of the washing stall, whereby the ramp is rotatable about a vertical axis between a retracted position and an extended position into and out of the open space created under the bottom wall of the stall. The extended position serves to align the ramp with the wall opening to thereby allow the animal ingress and egress through the wall opening. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> veterinary bathing station <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> for washing a small animal such as a large dog is shown. The bathing station <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> comprises a washing stall <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> having an initially open interior <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> defined by a side walls <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and front washing wall <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. A bottom wall <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> having a top planar surface <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and a bottom planar surface <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> complete the enclosure. The entire bathing station <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> can be made of any conveniently available water resistant material that is structurally sound but is preferably made of stainless steel. A particularly preferred material is 16 gauge type <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> stainless steel. While the bathing station <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> has been shown as a generally rectangular enclosure, it will be understood that other wall configurations might be utilized as well, such as, for example, an oval configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In the case of the bathing station illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the stall bottom wall or floor <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> measures approximately 4-6 feet in length by 1-3 feet in width such that there is sufficient room to turn a large dog around to reach the dog&apos;s hind quarter. Walls <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are approximately 1-3 feet in width and match the width of the bottom wall <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. The side wall <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and washing wall <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> are approximately 4-6 feet in length and also match the dimensions of the stall floor <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. The washing wall <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is approximately 3-5 feet in height in order to contain splashes and splatters and to help prevent against water damage to the surrounding areas but is low enough to allow the user to easily reach the stall interior in order to place an animal within the enclosure. The overall dimensions of the bathing station <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may be roughly 60&Prime;W&times;66&Prime;H&times;29&Prime;D. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The edges and corners of the washing stall <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and in particular the exposed portions of the washing wall <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> are rounded and may be covered with a cushioning type of material such as a rubber sleeve or coating to help prevent an animal or user from coming into contact with the corner regions. The walls and floor of the washing stall may be welded, forged, or otherwise formed into the enclosed shape illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The front portion of the stall interior contains a bathing faucet <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> of conventional design. The bathing faucet <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> preferably has a swing nozzle or utility spray that allows the user to reach the full span of the stall. The utility spray may have a flexible stainless steel hose, typically about 72 inches in length. The front portion <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> may also include a wall hook for hanging the hose when not in use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The stall floor <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> has a drain port <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). The drain port <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> in the illustrated embodiment is located in the front interior region of the stall floor and is centered along a central axis <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> of the floor <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. The floor <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> preferably slopes to the drain port <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, the slope being in the range from about 0&deg; to about 5&deg; such that water or other material will flow towards the drain but not such a slope that a wet animal would have difficulty standing on the slick, wet surface and be unable to gain a secure footing. A &ldquo;star&rdquo; break centered around the drain port <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> may help prevent water from collecting in the corners of the stall <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the stall is supported by leg elements support members <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. The leg elements <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> are preferably provided with adjustable feet <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> to compensate for uneven flooring or to adjust the height of the stall <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> to approximately 2-4 feet from the ground. The support members <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> themselves may also be adjustable. In addition, the feet <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> may include mounting plates to secure the bathing station <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to the surrounding support surface of flooring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The washing wall <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> has an opening <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> of sufficient size to allow an animal ingress and egress to the stall interior. The opening <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is approximately 2 feet wide and extends from the top edge <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> of the washing wall <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to about 0.5-3 inches from the bottom <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> of the washing wall <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Thus, the opening does not extend down the entire height of the washing wall <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to the floor <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, but rather produces a lip <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>. The lip <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> helps prevent water from being splashed outside the stall <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> when the animal exits and generally obviates the need to seal the bottom of the opening <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. The opening <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> may have a hinged or sliding door <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> that can be secured by latch <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, a hook, or some other means such as a magnet that can secure the door <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> in an open or closed position. The door <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> may be designed such that a lip seal is formed when the door <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is shut or it may have a rubber lining that allows for the door <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> to be reasonably sealed with the washing wall <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> when in the closed position. The door <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is mounted on hinges <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> which allow the door to swing open towards the interior of the stall. When closed, the door should be flush with the wall so a relatively smooth side is produced on both the inner portion <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and outer portion of the washing basin <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A rotatable coupling or swivel <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is located on the bottom planar surface of the floor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> of the stall. The coupling is located on the centerline <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The rotatable coupling <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is capable of rotating at least 90&deg; about a vertical axis <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> located on the centerline <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. The rotatable coupling supports a ramp <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. The ramp <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> is generally between about &frac12; and 2 feet wide and has an inclined ramp surface defined between a top end <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and a bottom end <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>. The ramp surface allows ingress and egress of an animal from the surrounding support surface through the wall opening without the necessity of lifting the animal. The rotatable coupling thus attaches the top end <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> of the ramp to the bottom wall <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> of the washing stall, whereby the ramp is rotatable about the vertical axis <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> into and out of the open space created under the bottom wall of the stall between a retracted position and an extended position. The extended position illustrated in solid lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> serves to align the ramp with the wall opening to thereby allow the animal ingress and egress through the wall opening. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the ramp bottom end <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> is solely supported by ball bearing swivel casters <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> which allow the bottom end <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> of the ramp <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> to slide, glide, or roll across the floor. The slope of the ramp <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> is steep enough so that it can slide under the washing basin <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> when not in use and still provide a means for easy access to the opening <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> but does not an unreasonable large pitch making walking up the ramp difficult. The ball bearings casters <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> allow the ramp <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> to move with very little applied force. The ramp may also be provided with a lock or soft stop which holds the ramp <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> in the extended position so there is very little movement when the animal is using the ramp <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. The ramp <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> may be covered with a rubber matt or some other non-slip type surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> An invention has been provided with several advantages. The bathing station of the invention provides a water tight enclosure with ease of access for a small animal, including large dogs which would otherwise be difficult to lift and maneuver. The animal can be easily led up the ramp <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, through the opening <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and into the stall <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Once the animal is in the stall <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, the door <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> may be closed and latched so a reasonably water tight seal is created around the stall enclosure. The ramp <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> is moved by the user to a position underneath the stall <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Because the ramp <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> is connected to the stall by a rotatable connection, the user can simply pushing the ramp in the direction underneath the washing basin <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> by using the foot or leg. Once the animal is bathed, the ramp is moved from underneath the washing basin <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to a position that will allow the animal to walk down the ramp. The ramp can then again be moved to the retracted position underneath the bottom wall of the stall. Because the animal does not have to be lifted over the side walls to an elevated position, the user is spared the likelihood of potential injuries. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> It should be understood that various alternatives to the embodiments of the invention described herein may be employed in practicing the invention. It is intended that the following claims define the scope of the invention and that structures and methods within the scope of these claims and their equivalents be covered thereby. </paragraph>
