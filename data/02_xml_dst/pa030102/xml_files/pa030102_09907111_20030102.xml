<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to methods for identifying oligonucleotide sequences which specifically bind to target molecules. More particularly, this invention is directed to methods for identifying oligonucleotide sequences in which the participation of fixed sequences is eliminated or minimized. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The dogma for many years was that nucleic acids had primarily an informational role. Through a method known as Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential enrichment, termed SELEX, it has become clear that nucleic acids have three dimensional structural diversity not unlike proteins. SELEX is a method for the in vitro evolution of nucleic acid molecules with highly specific binding to target molecules and is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/536,428, filed Jun. 11, 1990, entitled &ldquo;Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment,&rdquo; now abandoned, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/714,131, filed Jun. 10, 1991, entitled &ldquo;Nucleic Acid Ligands,&rdquo; now U.S. Pat. No. 5,475,096 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/931,473, filed Aug. 17, 1992, entitled &ldquo;Methods for Identifying Nucleic Acid Ligands,&rdquo; now U.S. Pat. No. 5,270,163 (see also WO 91/19813), each of which is specifically incorporated by reference herein. Each of these applications, collectively referred to herein as the SELEX Patent Applications, describes a fundamentally novel method for making a Nucleic Acid Ligand to any desired target molecule. The SELEX process provides a class of products which are referred to as Nucleic Acid Ligands, each ligand having a unique sequence, and which has the property of binding specifically to a desired target compound or molecule. Each SELEX-identified Nucleic Acid Ligand is a specific ligand of a given target compound or molecule. SELEX is based on the unique insight that Nucleic Acids have sufficient capacity for forming a variety of two- and three-dimensional structures and sufficient chemical versatility available within their monomers to act as ligands (form specific binding pairs) with virtually any chemical compound, whether monomeric or polymeric. Molecules of any size or composition can serve as targets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The SELEX method involves selection from a mixture of candidate oligonucleotides and step-wise iterations of binding, partitioning and amplification, using the same general selection scheme, to achieve virtually any desired criterion of binding affinity and selectivity. Starting from a mixture of Nucleic Acids, preferably comprising a segment of randomized sequence, the SELEX method includes steps of contacting the mixture with the target under conditions favorable for binding, partitioning unbound Nucleic Acids from those Nucleic Acids which have bound specifically to target molecules, dissociating the Nucleic Acid-target complexes, amplifying the Nucleic Acids dissociated from the Nucleic Acid-target complexes to yield a ligand-enriched mixture of Nucleic Acids, then reiterating the steps of binding, partitioning, dissociating and amplifying through as many cycles as desired to yield highly specific high affinity Nucleic Acid Ligands to the target molecule. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It has been recognized by the present inventors that the SELEX method demonstrates that Nucleic Acids as chemical compounds can form a wide array of shapes, sizes and configurations, and are capable of a far broader repertoire of binding and other functions than those displayed by Nucleic Acids in biological systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The present inventors have recognized that SELEX or SELEX-like processes could be used to identify Nucleic Acids which can facilitate any chosen reaction in a manner similar to that in which Nucleic Acid Ligands can be identified for any given target. In theory, within a Candidate Mixture of approximately 10<highlight><superscript>13 </superscript></highlight>to 10<highlight><superscript>18 </superscript></highlight>Nucleic Acids, the present inventors postulate that at least one Nucleic Acid exists with the appropriate shape to facilitate each of a broad variety of physical and chemical interactions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The basic SELEX method has been modified to achieve a number of specific objectives. For example, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/960,093, filed Oct. 14, 1992, entitled &ldquo;Method for Selecting Nucleic Acids on the Basis of Structure,&rdquo; now abandoned (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,707,796), describes the use of SELEX in conjunction with gel electrophoresis to select Nucleic Acid molecules with specific structural characteristics, such as bent DNA. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/123,935, filed Sep. 17, 1993, entitled &ldquo;Photoselection of Nucleic Acid Ligands,&rdquo; now abandoned (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,763,177), describes a SELEX based method for selecting Nucleic Acid Ligands containing photoreactive groups capable of binding and/or photocrosslinking to and/or photoinactivating a target molecule. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/134,028, filed Oct. 7, 1993, entitled &ldquo;High-Affinity Nucleic Acid Ligands That Discriminate Between Theophylline and Caffeine,&rdquo; now U.S. Pat. No. 5,580,737, describes a method for identifying highly specific Nucleic Acid Ligands able to discriminate between closely related molecules, which can be non-peptidic, termed Counter-SELEX. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/143,564, filed Oct. 25, 1993, entitled &ldquo;Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment: Solution SELEX,&rdquo; now U.S. Pat. No. 5,567,588, describes a SELEX-based method which achieves highly efficient partitioning between oligonucleotides having high and low affinity for a target molecule. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The SELEX method encompasses the identification of high-affinity Nucleic Acid Ligands containing modified nucleotides conferring improved characteristics on the ligand, such as improved in vivo stability or improved delivery characteristics. Examples of such modifications include chemical substitutions at the ribose and/or phosphate and/or base positions. SELEX-identified Nucleic Acid Ligands containing modified nucleotides are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/117,991, filed Sep. 8, 1993, entitled &ldquo;High Affinity Nucleic Acid Ligands Containing Modified Nucleotides,&rdquo; now U.S. Pat. No. 5,660,985, that describes oligonucleotides containing nucleotide derivatives chemically modified at the 5- and 2&prime;-positions of pyrimidines. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/134,028, supra, describes highly specific Nucleic Acid Ligands containing one or more nucleotides modified with 2&prime;-amino (2&prime;-NH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>), 2&prime;-fluoro (2&prime;-F), and/or 2&prime;-O-methyl (2&prime;-OMe). U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/264,029, filed Jun. 22, 1994, entitled &ldquo;Novel Method of Preparation of Known and Novel 2&prime;-Modified Nucleosides by Intramolecular Nucleophilic Displacement,&rdquo; now abandoned, describes oligonucleotides containing various 2&prime;-modified pyrimidines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The SELEX method encompasses combining selected oligonucleotides with other selected oligonucleotides and non-oligonucleotide functional units as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/284,063, filed Aug. 2, 1994, entitled &ldquo;Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment: Chimeric SELEX,&rdquo; now U.S. Pat. No. 5,637,459, and U.S. patent application Ser.

<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In the SELEX process, generally the candidate mixture includes regions of fixed sequences (i.e., each of the members of the candidate mixture contains the same sequences in the same location) and regions of randomized sequence. The fixed sequences are usually selected for: a) assisting in the amplification steps; b) mimicking a sequence known to bind to the target; or c) enhancing the concentration of a given structural arrangement of the nucleic acids in the candidate mixture. The fixed region(s) (or part of the fixed region) in the SELEX-identified Nucleic Acid Ligand may participate in binding to the target. Additionally, the fixed region(s) (or part of the fixed region) could form a structure(s) or contribute to a structure that binds to or facilitates binding to the target. Although in some circumstances this is a desirable attribute, in other circumstances the fixed region(s) may limit the possible structural variation and number of different nucleic acid ligands resulting from the SELEX process. The development of a method for generating nucleic acid ligands in which the participation of fixed sequences in binding to the target is minimized or eliminated is desirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Toole et al. (WO 92/14843) discloses a method for identifying oligonucleotide sequences which specifically bind biomolecules. In one embodiment, the method includes identifying and amplifying oligonucleotides without attached flanking regions or structural constraints, but which nevertheless are capable of specific binding to desired targets. This method provides the ability to engineer appropriate means for amplifying the desired oligonucleotides. In this method, a pool of oligonucleotides is generated in which the sequences are unknown. These sequences are incubated with the target under conditions wherein some of the oligonucleotides complex with the target. The oligonucleotides that complex with the target are recovered and known sequences are added to at least one end of the oligonucleotide. These known sequences are then used in amplifying the nucleic acid ligands. Once the nucleic acid ligands have been amplified, the known nucleotide sequence is removed. The process may be repeated for the desired number of rounds until an optimal nucleic acid ligand population may be identified. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A-E show MS2 CP binding sites. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> shows the consensus binding site of MS2 CP. NN&prime; is any base pair, R is either A or G, Y is either U or C. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference> shows a frequent selection artifact. The fixed sequence is shown in lowercase, the genomic insert in uppercase, the tail is underlined. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</cross-reference> shows the actual genomic sequence (from GenBank) that corresponds to the artifact shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>. It is shown &ldquo;folded&rdquo; only for comparison with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, and is not predicted to bind MS2 CP. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</cross-reference> shows the predicted structure of the major isolate (rffG) from SELEX with changing the fixed sequences. The genomic insert nucleotides are in uppercase, fixed sequence (starting with ggg at the 5&prime; end) in lowercase. The consensus binding site is shown in boldface. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</cross-reference> shows the SELEX consensus binding site of MS2 CP. SS&prime; is either GC or CG base pair. The first 2 NN&prime; base pairs must have at least one SS&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows an outline of the genomic SELEX experiments 1-5, with the number of isolates sequenced at the end of each SELEX. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows binding of RNA to MS2 CP. SELEX isolates with the consensus binding site, rffG and ebgR, bind well. To test whether the fixed sequences contribute to binding of the rffG isolate, the RNA fragment that corresponds exactly to its insert was obtained from <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>genomic DNA using PCR and in vitro transcription. This RNA fragment (rffG minus fixed sequences) binds only marginally worse than the original rffG SELEX isolate. For comparison, the natural MS2 CP binding site (bacteriophage MS2 replicase fragment) binds more weakly than all of the SELEX isolates with the consensus binding site (Table 2), except secY isolate (data not shown). A typical SELEX isolate without the consensus binding site does not appreciably bind MS2 CP, and neither does the starting library (data not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and B</cross-reference> show the genomic sequence of rffG in the vicinity of the MS2 CP binding site. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> shows the distribution of library 3&prime; end-points in the sequence of rffG. I designates an end-point, which is the terminal nucleotide of the genomic insert, right next to the library fixed sequence. The number of I&apos;s above a position is equal to the number of sequenced isolates (out of 19 total) with the end-point at this position. The MS2 CP consensus binding site is underlined. Asterisks (*&apos;s) designate the predicted range of end-points, given the size of the genomic inserts of the library (65 nucleotides), and allowing room for binding both of the rffG genomic primers during the isolation of these molecules from the starting library. The double-underlined sequence designates end-points that correspond to the majority (93%) of the rffG isolates in SELEX. The positions of these end-points were inferred from the isolates&apos; sequences and from the FokI cutting specificity (9-13 nucleotides away from the FokI recognition site). The majority of the library end-points (I&apos;s) fall in the same region as the majority of end-points of the rffG SELEX isolates. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference> shows a hypothetical event during library construction that may have caused the observed clustering of end-points. The rffG genomic sequence (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference>) is predicted to anneal weakly in its single-stranded form to the primer used in library construction. The primer has 9 randomized nucleotides at the 3&prime; end, and a fixed 5&prime; end sequence. This fixed sequence anneals to some genomic sites, such as the one shown, better than to others, and thus may cause an over-representation of the corresponding DNA in the library. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> shows truncation SELEX by size selection at the DNA level. An advanced SELEX pool is PCR amplified using primers lacking the T7 promoter sequence. The PCR products are partially digested with DNaseI and size fractionated by gel electrophoresis. Size fractionated partial digestion products are ligated to a plasmid digested by blunt end restriction enzyme. Ligation products are then PCR amplified using a set of primers binding to plasmid sequences flanking the digestion site. One of the primers contains the sequence for the T7 promoter which may or may not be part of the plasmid sequence. Such ligation reaction will create circular molecules having both possible orientations for each insert. To eliminate the molecules with the wrong orientation with respect to the T7 promoter, transcripts from the final PCR library are hybridized with excess biotinylated transcripts from the starting library and the hybrids are removed by streptavidin capture. Remaining unhybridized RNAs are then PCR amplified to generate the starting pool for truncation SELEX by size selection. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Definitions </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Nucleic Acid Ligand&rdquo; or &ldquo;Aptamer&rdquo; as used herein is a non-naturally occurring Nucleic Acid having a desirable action on a Target. A desirable action includes, but is not limited to, binding of the Target, catalytically changing the Target, reacting with the Target in a way which modifies/alters the Target or the functional activity of the Target, covalently attaching to the Target as in a suicide inhibitor, facilitating the reaction between the Target and another molecule. In the preferred embodiment, the action is specific binding affinity for a Target molecule, such Target molecule being a three dimensional chemical structure other than a polynucleotide that binds to the Nucleic Acid Ligand through a mechanism which predominantly depends on Watson/Crick base pairing or triple helix binding, wherein the Nucleic Acid Ligand is not a Nucleic Acid having the known physiological function of being bound by the Target molecule. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Candidate Mixture&rdquo; is a mixture of Nucleic Acids of differing sequence from which to select a desired ligand. The source of a Candidate Mixture can be from naturally occurring Nucleic Acids or fragments thereof, chemically synthesized Nucleic Acids, enzymatically synthesized Nucleic Acids or Nucleic Acids made by a combination of the foregoing techniques. In a preferred embodiment, each Nucleic Acid has fixed sequences surrounding a randomized region to facilitate the amplification process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Nucleic Acid&rdquo; means either DNA, RNA, single-stranded or double-stranded and any chemical modifications thereof. Modifications include, but are not limited to, those that provide other chemical groups that incorporate additional charge, polarizability, hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interaction, and fluxionality to the Nucleic Acid Ligand bases or to the Nucleic Acid Ligand as a whole. Such modifications include, but are not limited to, 2&prime;-position sugar modifications, 5-position pyrimidine modifications, 8-position purine modifications, modifications at exocyclic amines, substitution of 4-thiouridine, substitution of 5-bromo or 5-iodo-uracil, backbone modifications such as internucleoside phosphorothioate linkages, methylations, unusual base-pairing combinations such as the isobases isocytidine and isoguanidine and the like. Modifications can also include 3&prime; and 5&prime; modifications such as capping. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;SELEX&rdquo; methodology involves the combination of selection of Nucleic Acid Ligands that interact with a Target in a desirable manner, for example binding to a protein, with amplification of those selected Nucleic Acids. Iterative cycling of the selection/amplification steps allows selection of one or a small number of Nucleic Acids that interact most strongly with the Target from a pool which contains a very large number of Nucleic Acids. Cycling of the selection/amplification procedure is continued until a selected goal is achieved. The SELEX methodology is described in the SELEX Patent Applications. The SELEX methodology is sometimes referred to herein as Conventional SELEX. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Genomic SELEX&rdquo; is a variation on the SELEX methodology in which the nucleic acids in the randomized region of the candidate mixture are replaced by genomic sequences (or inserts) derived from an organism. Genomic SELEX is also sometimes referred to herein as Conventional (or Regular) Genomic SELEX when the method is performed without changing the fixed sequences or annealing of oligonucleotides. It will be understood from the context of the specification whether Genomic SELEX is being performed with or without changing the fixed sequences or annealing of oligonucleotides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Truncation SELEX&rdquo; is a variation on the SELEX methodology in which the participation of fixed sequences in the binding to the Target is minimized or eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Truncation SELEX by Ligation&rdquo; is a variation on the Truncation SELEX Method whereby amplifiable molecules are created by introducing fixed regions with a ligation reaction after interaction with the target (i.e., the nucleic acid does not contain fixed sequences when it interacts with the target). An example of Truncation SELEX by Ligation is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. Other examples of the method are also contemplated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Truncation SELEX by Hybridization&rdquo; is a variation on the Truncation SELEX Method whereby amplifiable molecules are obtained by hybridizing the selected nucleic acid (containing minimal or no fixed sequences) to the original candidate mixture. An example of Truncation SELEX by Hybridization is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. Other examples of the method are also contemplated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Target&rdquo; means any compound or molecule of interest for which a ligand is desired. A Target can be a protein (such as PDGF, thrombin, and selectin), peptide, carbohydrate, polysaccharide, glycoprotein, hormone, receptor, antigen, antibody, virus, substrate, metabolite, transition state analog, cofactor, inhibitor, drug, dye, nutrient, growth factor, etc. without limitation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The SELEX process provides a class of products which are Nucleic Acid molecules, each having a unique sequence, and each of which has the property of binding specifically to a desired Target compound or molecule. Target molecules are preferably proteins, but can also include among others carbohydrates, peptidoglycans and a variety of small molecules. SELEX methodology can also be used to Target biological structures, such as cell surfaces or viruses, through specific interaction with a molecule that is an integral part of that biological structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> In its most basic form, the SELEX process may be defined by the following series of steps: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> 1) A Candidate Mixture of Nucleic Acids of differing sequence is prepared. The Candidate Mixture generally includes regions of fixed sequences (i.e., each of the members of the Candidate Mixture contains the same sequences in the same location) and regions of randomized sequences. The fixed sequence regions are selected either: (a) to assist in the amplification steps described below, (b) to mimic a sequence known to bind to the Target, or (c) to enhance the concentration of a given structural arrangement of the Nucleic Acids in the Candidate Mixture. The randomized sequences can be totally randomized (i.e., the probability of finding a base at any position being one in four) or only partially randomized (e.g., the probability of finding a base at any location can be selected at any level between 0 and 100 percent). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> 2) The Candidate Mixture is contacted with the selected Target under conditions favorable for binding between the Target and members of the Candidate Mixture. Under these circumstances, the interaction between the Target and the Nucleic Acids of the Candidate Mixture can be considered as forming Nucleic Acid-target pairs between the Target and those Nucleic Acids having the strongest affinity for the Target. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> 3) The Nucleic Acids with the highest affinity for the target are partitioned from those Nucleic Acids with lesser affinity to the target. Because only an extremely small number of sequences (and possibly only one molecule of Nucleic Acid) corresponding to the highest affinity Nucleic Acids exist in the Candidate Mixture, it is generally desirable to set the partitioning criteria so that a significant amount of the Nucleic Acids in the Candidate Mixture (approximately 5-50%) are retained during partitioning. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> 4) Those Nucleic Acids selected during partitioning as having the relatively higher affinity for the target are then amplified to create a new Candidate Mixture that is enriched in Nucleic Acids having a relatively higher affinity for the target. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> 5) By repeating the partitioning and amplifying steps above, the newly formed Candidate Mixture contains fewer and fewer unique sequences, and the average degree of affinity of the Nucleic Acids to the target will generally increase. Taken to its extreme, the SELEX process will yield a Candidate Mixture containing one or a small number of unique Nucleic Acids representing those Nucleic Acids from the original Candidate Mixture having the highest affinity to the target molecule. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The basic SELEX method has been modified to achieve a number of specific objectives. For example, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/960,093, filed Oct. 14, 1992, entitled &ldquo;Method for Selecting Nucleic Acids on the Basis of Structure,&rdquo; now abandoned (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,707,796), describes the use of SELEX in conjunction with gel electrophoresis to select Nucleic Acid molecules with specific structural characteristics, such as bent DNA. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/123,935, filed Sep. 17, 1993, entitled &ldquo;Photoselection of Nucleic Acid Ligands,&rdquo; now abandoned (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,763,177), describes a SELEX based method for selecting Nucleic Acid Ligands containing photoreactive groups capable of binding and/or photocrosslinking to and/or photoinactivating a target molecule. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/134,028, filed Oct. 7, 1993, entitled &ldquo;High-Affinity Nucleic Acid Ligands That Discriminate Between Theophylline and Caffeine,&rdquo; now U.S. Pat. No. 5,580,737, describes a method for identifying highly specific Nucleic Acid Ligands able to discriminate between closely related molecules, termed Counter-SELEX. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/143,564, filed Oct. 25, 1993, entitled &ldquo;Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment: Solution SELEX,&rdquo; now U.S. Pat. No. 5,567,588, describes a SELEX-based method which achieves highly efficient partitioning between oligonucleotides having high and low affinity for a target molecule. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/964,624, filed Oct. 21, 1992, entitled &ldquo;Nucleic Acid Ligands to HIV-RT and HIV-1 Rev,&rdquo; now U.S. Pat. No. 5,496,938, describes methods for obtaining improved Nucleic Acid Ligands after SELEX has been performed. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/400,440, filed Mar. 8, 1995, entitled &ldquo;Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment: Chemi-SELEX,&rdquo; now U.S. Pat. No. 5,705,337, describes methods for covalently linking a ligand to its target. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> The SELEX method encompasses the identification of high-affinity Nucleic Acid Ligands containing modified nucleotides conferring improved characteristics on the ligand, such as improved in vivo stability or improved delivery characteristics. Examples of such modifications include chemical substitutions at the ribose and/or phosphate and/or base positions. SELEX-identified Nucleic Acid Ligands containing modified nucleotides are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/117,991, filed Sep. 8, 1993, entitled &ldquo;High Affinity Nucleic Acid Ligands Containing Modified Nucleotides,&rdquo; now U.S. Pat. No. 5,660,985, that describes oligonucleotides containing nucleotide derivatives chemically modified at the 5- and 2&prime;-positions of pyrimidines. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/134,028, supra, describes highly specific Nucleic Acid Ligands containing one or more nucleotides modified with 2&prime;-amino (2&prime;-NH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>), 2&prime;-fluoro (2&prime;-F), and/or 2&prime;-O-methyl (2&prime;-OMe). U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/264,029, filed June 22, 1994, entitled &ldquo;Novel Method of Preparation of Known and Novel 2&prime; Modified Nucleosides by Intramolecular Nucleophilic Displacement,&rdquo; describes oligonucleotides containing various 2&prime;-modified pyrimidines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The SELEX method encompasses combining selected oligonucleotides with other selected oligonucleotides and non-oligonucleotide functional units as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/284,063, filed Aug. 2, 1994, entitled &ldquo;Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment: Chimeric SELEX,&rdquo; now U.S. Pat. No. 5,637,459, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/234,997, filed Apr. 28, 1994, entitled &ldquo;Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment: Blended SELEX,&rdquo; now U.S. Pat. No. 5,683,867, respectively. These applications allow the combination of the broad array of shapes and other properties, and the efficient amplification and replication properties, of oligonucleotides with the desirable properties of other molecules. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The SELEX method further encompasses combining selected Nucleic Acid Ligands with Lipophilic Compounds or Non-Immunogenic, High Molecular Weight Compounds in a diagnostic or therapeutic Complex as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/434,465, filed May 4, 1995, entitled &ldquo;Nucleic Acid Ligand Complexes.&rdquo; The SELEX method further encompasses combining selected VEGF Nucleic Acid Ligands with lipophilic compounds, such as diacyl glycerol or dialkyl glycerol, as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/39,109, filed Oct. 25, 1996, entitled &ldquo;Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) Nucleic Acid Ligand Complexes,&rdquo; now U.S. Pat. No. 10 5,859,229. VEGF Nucleic Acid Ligands that are associated with a High Molecular Weight, Non-Immunogenic Compound, such as Polyethylene glycol, or a Lipophilic Compound, such as Glycerolipid, phospholipid, or glycerol amide lipid, in a diagnostic or therapeutic complex are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/897,351, filed Jul. 21, 1997, entitled &ldquo;Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) Nucleic Acid Ligand Complexes.&rdquo; Each of the above described patent applications that describe modifications of the basic SELEX procedure are specifically incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> SELEX identifies Nucleic Acid Ligands that are able to bind targets with high affinity and with outstanding specificity, which represents a singular achievement that is unprecedented in the field of Nucleic Acids research. These characteristics are, of course, the desired properties one skilled in the art would seek in a therapeutic or diagnostic ligand. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> In order to produce Nucleic Acid Ligands desirable for use as a pharmaceutical, it is preferred that the Nucleic Acid Ligand (1) binds to the target in a manner capable of achieving the desired effect on the target; (2) be as small as possible to obtain the desired effect; (3) be as stable as possible; and (4) be a specific ligand to the chosen target. In most situations, it is preferred that the Nucleic Acid Ligand has the highest possible affinity to the target. Additionally, Nucleic Acid Ligands can have facilitating properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> In commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/964,624, filed Oct. 21, 1992, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,496,938 (&apos;938), methods are described for obtaining improved Nucleic Acid Ligands after SELEX has been performed. The &apos;938 patent, entitled &ldquo;Nucleic Acid Ligands to HIV-RT and HIV-1 Rev,&rdquo; is specifically incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, generally the candidate mixture in the SELEX process includes regions of fixed sequences and randomized sequences. The fixed sequences are usually present for assisting in the amplification steps of the SELEX process and may participate in binding to the target or contribute to structures that bind to the target. In some circumstances, the participation of the fixed sequences in binding to the target may not be desirable. Generation of nucleic acid ligands in which the participation of fixed sequences in binding to the target is minimized or eliminated can be accomplished is several ways: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> 1) The participation of fixed regions in the binding of the target could be reduced or eliminated by annealing complementary oligonucleotides to the fixed regions prior to contacting the candidate mixture with the target. The double-stranded region is then bound together through Watson/Crick base pairing, and, therefore, is not available for binding to the target. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> 2) The fixed regions can also be changed at different rounds. As these sequences are changed, their participation of any one fixed region in binding is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> 3) Reduce the size of the fixed regions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> 4) Eliminate the fixed sequences before interaction with the target. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> As described above, in some circumstances it is desirable to have short ligands following the SELEX process. The reduction in the fixed region of the template will accomplish reduction in the overall size of the individual molecules. Reduction of the fixed regions is limited in order to maintain PCR amplification. The shortest primer binding site reported for specific amplification is 7-bases long (Vincent et al. (1994) DNA and Cell Biology 13:75-82). Based on this approach, templates were designed to allow amplification of RNA that has 5&prime; and 3&prime; fixed regions of 5- and 8-bases long (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference>). RT/PCR efficiency of such abbreviated template is about two logs lower than the N7 template series but nevertheless, sub-picomole amounts of RNA can be amplified within a reasonable number of PCR cycles (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Reduction of the random region of the template will also accomplish reduction in the overall size of the individual molecules. Random region of a certain length however might be crucial in the isolation of high affinity and bioactivity ligands as evident by experiments where libraries with random regions of different length were applied to the same target in parallel. In one such experiment where TGF&bgr;1 was the SELEX target, it was determined that the length of the random region affected the recovery of bioactive ligands with only the 40N libraries yielded high affinity bioactive ligands, as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/046,247, filed Mar. 23, 1998. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> To further illustrate the approach for elimination of fixed sequences, the primer binding sites are removed from the molecules of the library, before the interaction with the target. After selection, primer binding sites are re-introduced for amplification and generation of the pool for the next round. Primer-binding-site-removal requires nucleolytic digestion either before or after generation of the population of single stranded molecules. In SELEX experiments requiring transcription, removal of at least the 5&prime; fixed region must occur after transcription because digestion before transcription will remove the promoter site and will eliminate transcription. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> For SELEX experiments using DNA based libraries, removal of primer binding sites can be done as described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference>. The original synthetic oligonucleotide library utilized for this approach can be engineered to include restriction endonuclease digestion sites that generated 3&prime; or 5&prime; recessive ends as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference>. For digestion after generation of single stranded molecules, oligonucleotides complementary to the fixed regions are annealed and the complexes are digested by appropriate restriction endonucleases. Alternatively, digestion can occur at the dsDNA level and digested single strands can be purified by incorporation of biotin at the 3&prime; recessive restriction site by using the Klenow fragment of <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>DNA polymerase-I and biotin-dUTP. For biotinylation at one end, restriction digestion at that end can be followed by a fill-in reaction with the Klenow DNA polymerase-I when a restriction enzyme that generates 3&prime; recessive sites is used, or by a terminal transferase reaction in the presence of biotin-dUTP. Biotinylation reactions are then followed by restriction digestion at the other end. If the digestion occurs at the ssDNA level the use of 3&prime; versus 5&prime; recessive restriction sites is not important and any restriction site can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> For SELEX experiments using RNA based libraries, removal of primer binding sites can be done by site specific digestion by RNaseH as described below, where DNA-2&prime; OMeRNA oligonucleotides are annealed to RNA molecules and the hybridization products are digested by RNaseH. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Following digestion and selection the fixed sequences need to be added back to the library in order to allow amplification and carry the pool forward to the next round. Generation of amplifiable pools following nuclease digestion and affinity selection can be achieved as described below in two ways (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B and 6C</cross-reference>), namely either enzymatically (Truncation-SELEX-by-Ligation or Truncation-SELEX-by-Tailing) or by hybrid selection of purified complementary strands from the pool in use (Truncation-SELEX-by-Hybrid-Selection). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Overview of Truncation-SELEX-by-Ligation </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> This is an enzymatic method of Truncation SELEX. The steps of Truncation-SELEX-by-ligation are summarized in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. This approach can be applied either at the beginning of a SELEX experiment or following several regular rounds of the SELEX process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> For de novo Truncation-SELEX-by-ligation, the starting synthetic oligonucleotide pools can be designed to include just the random region. In order to avoid potential counterselection pressure due to transcription efficiency, especially if modified nucleotides are used as polymerase substrates, it might be beneficial to include a transcription initiation sequence immediately downstream of the T7 promoter such as 5&prime;GGGAG followed by the random region. The starting pool may include a 3&prime; primer binding site or it may not. If no 3&prime; primer binding site is used at the starting pool, then single stranded oligonucleotides can be converted to double stranded templates by including the T7 promoter-initiator complement at the 3&prime; end of the random region, for example 5&prime;&lsqb;N&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>30</subscript></highlight>CTCCCTATAGTGAGTCGTA TTA (SEQ ID NO:325), and performing primer extension using a primer such as 5&prime;TAATACGACT CACTATAGGGAG (SEQ ID NO:46). If there is a 3&prime; primer binding site, then RNaseH digestion can be used, as described below, to remove that fixed sequence before binding to the target. Alternatively, a starting pool of DNA templates can be used where appropriate restriction sites were incorporated downstream of the T7 promoter and random region as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</cross-reference>. The pool of RNA is then generated by transcription of templated digested by the appropriate restriction enzyme. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> For application of truncation SELEX on pools evolved by conventional SELEX experiments, the primer binding sites are removed by digestion and then they are reintroduced following affinity selection by ligation. These steps will be done at each truncation SELEX round. Alternatively, a 5&prime; truncated library can be generated before affinity selection starts. This is a preferential alternative to avoid the use of a random bridge sequence for the 5&prime; end ligation since such ligation condition is inefficient. The generation of the 5&prime; truncated library will allow introduction of the transcription initiation sequence 5&prime;GGGAG adjacent to the 5&prime; end of the random region of the template. This initiation sequence in addition of relieving potential transcription selection bias, it can also provide a specific sequence for the ligation bridge used in the introduction of the 5&prime; primer binding site. Therefore, a conventional SELEX pool (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) is converted into dsDNA template by extension with the 3&prime; primer; the ds template is then transcribed to generate the full length RNA transcripts (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>); these transcripts are then digested with RNaseH to remove either both or just the 5&prime; primer binding site <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>); the digested RNA is then reverse transcribed (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) using the 3&prime; primer after ligation of the 3&prime; primer binding site by T4 RNA ligase (if necessary (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>)) to generate appropriate cDNA (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>); the generated cDNA is then ligated using T4 DNA ligase (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) to the DNA oligonucleotide encoding the T7 promoter-initiator (5&prime;TAATACGACTCACTATAGG GAGNNNNN (SEQ ID NO:37)) which has been preannealed to the bridge DNA oligonucleotide 5&prime;CTCCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTA (SEQ ID NO:36) (Table 4, set two); the ligation product (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>) is PCR amplified to generate a new dsDNA template (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>) lacking the bulk of the 5&prime; primer binding site; this new template is transcribed to generate a 5&prime; truncated transcript (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>); the 5&prime; truncated RNA is then digested with RNaseH at the 3&prime; end (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) to generate the truncated RNA for selection (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> For each truncation-SELEX-by-ligation round, truncated RNA (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>) generated by either method described above is bound to the target, and bound molecules are partitioned with an appropriate partition method and ligated to the 3&prime; primer binding site (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) using RNA ligase and an appropriate DNA oligo complementary to the 3&prime; primer. The resulting ligation product is reverse transcribed using the 3&prime; primer (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>) to generate cDNA (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>). The cDNA is then ligated (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>) to the DNA oligonucleotide encoding the T7 promoter (5&prime;TAATACGACTCA CTATAG GGA (SEQ ID NO:35)) which has been preannealed to the bridge DNA oligonucleotide 5&prime;TATAGTGAGTCGTATTA (SEQ ID NO:34) (Table 4, set one), and PCR amplified (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>) to generate a new dsDNA template (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>); this new template pool is then transcribed to generate a new RNA pool which is carried to the next round following removal of the 3&prime; primer binding site by RNaseH digestion (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Overview of Truncation SELEX by Tailing </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> This is an alternative enzymatic method of Truncation SELEX. The steps of Truncation-SELEX-by-tailing are summarized in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. This approach is similar to the truncation SELEX by ligation protocol where the fixed sequences are the result of a tailing reaction by the terminal deoxy transferase instead of ligase. Like the ligation approach, it can be applied either at the beginning of a SELEX experiment or following several rounds of the regular SELEX process. According to this scheme, selected truncated RNA (generated as described in the ligation protocol), (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) is incubated with terminal deoxy transferase (TdT) and a single dNTP to add homopolymeric tail at its 3&prime; end <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). The length of the tail can be adjusted by including either ddNTP or NTPs at different ratios to the dNTPs to slow down the tailing reaction (Schmidt et al. (1996) Nucleic Acids Research 24:1789-1791). Tailed RNA is then reverse transcribed with reverse transcriptase (RT) and a complementary oligonucleotide to the added tail (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>). The complementary to the tail oligonucleotide could be engineered to contain a couple of fixed positions to its 3&prime; end complementary to fixed positions of the 3&prime; end of the truncated RNA so it can be anchored adjacent to the 3&prime; end of the selected RNA. The generated cDNA (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) is then tailed with TdT and a different dNTP (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) preferably with pyrimidines to generate templates with appropriate T7 transcription initiation sites. The generated tailed cDNA can be amplified by PCR (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) using the 3&prime; primer used in the RT reaction and a 5&prime; primer engineered to be complementary to the 3&prime; tail of the cDNA and to contain the T7 promoter sequence to allow in vitro transcription of the selected and PCR amplified pool (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) for the next SELEX cycle. The in vitro transcribed transcript (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>) can then be digested at both ends with RNaseH and appropriate targeting 2-OMe-deoxy oligonucleotide chimeras to generated the new truncated RNA pool (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>) for the next round of selection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Overview of Truncation-SELEX-by-Hybrid-Selection </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> The steps of RNA Truncation-SELEX-by-hybrid-selection are summarized in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. This approach relies in the ability of selected RNA to function as a capture probe of its complementary sequence found in the same pool that generated the RNA used in this particular round. Complementary sequences are generated by either strand separation and purification from the dsDNA PCR product (Pagratis (1996) Nucleic Acids Research 24:3645-6) or by in vitro T3 or SP6 transcription from templates designed to contain appropriate promoter sequences at the 5&prime; end of the negative strands as part of the 3&prime; fixed sequence. Such complementary strands are still full length, containing their primer binding sites and therefore PCR amplifiable. This method can be applied to both RNA and DNA SELEX differing only by the method of generation of single stranded pool and the digestion of such single stranded pool. For DNA SELEX, the single stranded molecules are generated by strand separation (Pagratis (1996) Nucleic Acids Research 24:3645-6) and are digested as described above. For RNA SELEX, the single stranded molecules are generated by in vitro transcription followed by RNaseH digestion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Each RNA truncation-SELEX-by-hybrid-selection round, starts with a dsDNA template (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) generated by PCR in the presence of 5&prime; primer biotinylated at its 5&prime; end. A portion of the dsDNA template is used to purify the template (negative) strand as described above, while another portion is used to generate the single stranded selection pool, for example RNA (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>); the single stranded selection pool is then digested, for example with RNaseH (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>); digested molecules (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) are partitioned based on their binding to the target (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>); partitioned molecules are biotinylated, for example with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>); biotinylated selected molecules are then hybridized to prepurified template strands from the same starting pool and hybrids are partitioned by streptavidin capture (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>); captured template strands are then PCR amplified (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>) to generate the new pool for the next truncation-SELEX-by-hybrid-selection round. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> When the hybrid selection method is used, the hybridization rate of complex nucleic acids must be taken into consideration, so enough hybridization time is given at early rounds to allow capture of selected sequences. There is a practical limit on the complexity of pools that can be utilized in the hybrid selection method. This practical limit needs to be determined experimentally in the presence of compounds that enhance hybridization rate such as CTAB (Pontius and Berg (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 88:8237-8241; Nedbal et al. (1997) Biochemistry 36:13552-57). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Size Selection </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> This approach is a variation of the scheme, which involves removal of fixed sequence and subsequent reintroduction of the same or different fixed sequences either enzymatically, or by hybrid selection. It involves the random fragmentation of an advanced or semiadvanced SELEX pool at either the DNA or RNA level followed by size selection (for example using gel electrophoresis), and finally by introduction of fixed sequences either enzymatically or by hybrid selection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Digestion at the DNA level (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>) can be done with DNaseI and fragments of specified length are extracted from a sizing gel slice (or by any other method i.e. density gradient sedimentation, gel filtration etc.) and ligated to a circular vector (for example PCR-Script, Stratagene, Inc., La Jolla, Calif.). Ligation reactions are then served as templates for PCR amplification using a new set of fixed sequences, which include the T7 RNA polymerase promoter with the 5&prime;, fixed sequence. PCR amplification of the pool can follow <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>transformation but this step could be limiting in sequence space due to the <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>transformation efficiency (10<highlight><superscript>8</superscript></highlight>-10<highlight><superscript>10</superscript></highlight>). The PCR generated pool is the starting library of the truncation SELEX where the pool is transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase, digested by RNaseH to remove the new fixed sequences, and affinity selected by binding to the target. Selected RNA is then amplified by reintroducing fixed sequences by either the truncation SELEX-by-Ligation, -Tailing or -Hybrid Selection methods as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Digestion at the RNA level can be done with a nuclease and digested RNA can be size selected by gel electrophoresis (or any other method). Size selected RNA can either be used for affinity selection directly or can be used to generate a starting pool for subsequent truncation SELEX rounds. When RNA is used directly following affinity selection, the next pool is generated by either the truncation SELEX-by-Ligation, -Tailing or -Hybrid Selection methods as described above. When RNA is used to generate the starting pool for truncation SELEX, fixed sequences can be introduced enzymatically by either the truncation SELEX-by-Ligation, or -Tailing methods as described above. The new pools are then used as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> Screening for Ligands of a Certain Size </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> There is a desire for obtaining short ligands following application of the SELEX process for economical reasons. Therefore an efficient way to screen for ligands that can be truncated to an appropriate length could be very useful. Screening can be done by procedures that allow boundary determination. Currently boundary determination (Fitzwater and Polisky (1996) Methods Enzymol 267:275-301) is done in two separate experiments where each boundary is first determined separately followed by experiments where both boundaries are tested together in one molecule for binding activity (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>). This procedure is tedious and it can be done in a small set of ligands. Furthermore, there are examples that combination of the two boundaries, determined independently in the same molecule, results in inactive ligands (data not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> Presented here is an alternative way of screening for ligands that can tolerate truncation to a given length. This approach is based on random cleavage of internally labeled RNA ligands and then partition of those fragments that retain binding to the target followed by gel electrophoresis (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>). Random cleavage of oligonucleotides on n length generates (n(n&plus;1))/2 fragments (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>). Among these fragments only those that contain the minimum necessary fragment will retain binding to the target. Electrophoretic analysis on sequencing gels of all randomly generated fragments that have been partitioned for target binding will generate a pattern containing a continuous range of partial length fragments greater or equal of a minimum length (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>). This method can be used to screen ligands for their possible minimal length. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the size of the minimal fragment necessary for binding can be determined in a large number of ligands at once as follows. Each ligand is randomly cleaved to generate a ladder of molecules. These molecules are radioactively labeled by either using body labeled starting material or end labeling the resulting fragments, following fragmentation. End labeling can be done with either kinase or RNA ligase or terminal transferase with &ggr;-<highlight><superscript>32</superscript></highlight>P-ATP or <highlight><superscript>32</superscript></highlight>P-pCp or &agr;<highlight><superscript>32</superscript></highlight>P-ddNTP, respectively. The resulting radiolabeled ladder is allowed to bind to the target and the target bound molecules are then partitioned and analyzed on a sequencing gel along with size markers. Following autoradiography, minimum retained fragment for each ligand can be observed and ligands with minimum fragments of desired length can be identified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> In addition to screening, minimum fragment methodology can be used for truncation SELEX where the minimum fragments are excised from the gel and used in the truncation SELEX schemes described above. </paragraph>

The volume was adjusted with the binding buffer to make up for the loss on the filter. MS2 CP was added to the final concentration of 100 nM of the dimer in a 0.1 ml reaction. Binding proceeded for 45 minutes at room temperature (22-24&deg; C.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> The binding reaction was vacuum manifold-filtered through nitrocellulose (0.45 micron pore, 25 mm diameter, Micron Separations, Westborough, Mass.) and washed with 5 ml of the binding buffer. The fraction of the bound RNA, that is retained on nitrocellulose, was estimated by Cerenkov counting. The protein and RNA concentrations were chosen so that in every round this fraction was as low as possible, usually less than 1-2% of the total (to speed up the selection), but higher than in the control reaction without MS2 CP (to reduce the &ldquo;background&rdquo; selection of nitrocellulose binders). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> The bound RNA was eluted from the cut filters by denaturation at 95&deg; C. for 2 minutes in a suspension of 0.5 ml of 8 M urea in TBE and 0.5 ml of phenol, and then amplified for the next round of SELEX essentially as in Tuerk ((1997) Methods Mol. Biol. 67:219-230) with the following changes. RNA and primer B (5&prime;-tcccgctcgtcgtctg-3&prime; (SEQ ID NO:3)) were denatured at 95&deg; C. for 1 minute, annealed at 70&deg; C. for 10 minutes, and reverse transcribed at 48&deg; C. for 30 minutes with SuperScript (Gibco BRL) reverse transcriptase (these temperatures were chosen to melt RNA secondary structures). The cDNA was amplified in PCR with Taq DNA polymerase as in Singer et al. ((1997) Nuc. Acids Res. 25:781-786) with primers B and A (5&prime;-gaaa<highlight><uline>ttaatacgactcactataggg</uline></highlight>aggacgatgcgg-3&prime; (SEQ ID NO:326); T7 promoter underlined). In this PCR, as well as in all others in this study, the relatively low concentrations of MgCl<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(3 mM) and dNTPs (50 &mgr;M each) served to decrease the error rate. RNA was transcribed, labeled and gel-purified as in Schneider et al. ((1992) J. Mol. Bio. 228:862-9) and Tuerk ((1997) Methods Mol. Biol. 67:219-230). After the completion of SELEX, DNA was cloned and sequenced as in Singer et al. ((1997) Nuc. Acids Res. 25:781-786). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> Instead of 1 nmole of RNA, 0.1 nmoles of RNA and 0.4 nmoles of each of the two complementary oligonucleotides were used (Table 1). An extra 10 minute incubation at room temperature was introduced directly after the addition of the binding buffer to allow oligonucleotides to anneal. The annealed oligonucleotides decreased the yield of the full-length reverse transcription product only by 10%. Otherwise, this SELEX was identical to the conventional SELEX. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> SELEX with Changing the Fixed Sequences </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> Step 1. Changing the 3&prime; fixed sequence: DNA purification and PCR. Conventional SELEX was carried out for 3 rounds using the old fixed sequence primers A and B described above. Since the old fixed sequences did not contain FokI restriction sites, the sites had to be introduced by PCR (alternatively, the sites can be introduced during the library construction). DNA product from either the reverse transcription reaction, or from PCR after round 3, was purified from primer B. Primer B interferes with the subsequent steps if not completely removed. Reverse transcription product was purified on a Microcon-30 filter (Amicon, Mass.), by centrifugation 3 times with 0.2 ml of TE buffer for 10 minutes at 16,000&times;g. PCR product, since it contains more primer B, had to be purified, instead of Microcon-30, by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) with ethidium bromide staining, followed by crush-and-soak elution for 30 minutes at 37&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> Purified DNA was amplified by PCR (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) using primer A and primer B&plus;FokI (5&prime;-tcccgctcgtGgATGg-3&prime; (SEQ ID NO:327)). Primer B&plus;FokI introduces the FokI recognition site (GgATG, shown in boldface) into the old 3&prime; fixed sequence, and differs from primer B at the uppercase nucleotides (G, ATG). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> The amplified DNA was extracted with chloroform, phenol, and 2 more times with chloroform, then ethanol precipitated and resuspended in water (unpurified PCR product inhibits subsequent FokI digestion). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> Step 2. FokI digestion. Purified DNA product of 0.1 ml PCR was incubated with FokI (New England Biolabs) at a ratio of &gt;1.5 units per microgram of DNA (the DNA mass was estimated assuming that &lt;100% of the primers were converted into the full-length PCR product). This ratio had to be optimized with every new DNA preparation. FokI digestion was carried out in 40 &mgr;l at 37&deg; C. for 1 hour in the manufacturer&apos;s buffer with 0.1% of Tween-20 detergent to decrease the exonuclease activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> Step 3. Klenow extension. dNTPs (final concentration of 0.5 mM each) and the Klenow fragment of <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>DNA polymerase I (from US Biochemicals, final concentration 370 units/ml) were added directly to the FokI digest. Extension proceeded for 15 minutes at 37&deg; C. The digested and blunt-ended library DNA was then purified from the other digestion fragments by native PAGE as in step 1. PAGE showed that 60% of the input DNA was cut as expected, 40% was degraded nonspecifically, and a negligible fraction was left uncut. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> Step 4. Ligation. The purified library DNA was resuspended in water and blunt-end ligated to the new fixed sequence. The new fixed sequence was a duplex of two DNA oligonucleotides: C (5&prime;-ggtgcggcagttcggt-3&prime; (SEQ ID NO:328)) and its complement, cC (5&prime;-accgaactgccgcacct-3&prime; (SEQ ID NO:329)). The duplex was formed by incubation of the mixture of 200 pmoles of each oligo in 4 &mgr;l of TE at 95&deg; C. for 1 minute, followed by 60&deg; C. for 10 minutes and room temperature for 10 minutes. The duplex was added to the purified DNA, and incubated with 2 units of T4 DNA ligase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in the manufacturer&apos;s buffer in 20 &mgr;l for 1 hour at 30&deg; C. The ligation yield was 50%, estimated by Molecular Dynamics phosphorimager quantification of <highlight><superscript>32</superscript></highlight>P-labeled DNA separated by PAGE. The overall yield of all steps was 10% relative to the input DNA at the beginning of step 2. The relatively high blunt-end ligation yield was achieved by keeping all DNAs as concentrated as possible (more than a few &mgr;M), since the K<highlight><subscript>m </subscript></highlight>of ligase for blunt ends is 50 &mgr;M (Sugino et al. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 252:3987-94). The oligonucleotides, lacking a phosphate, cannot be ligated to anything except the digested library DNA. To reduce ligation of the library DNA molecules to each other, an excess of oligonucleotides over the library DNA was used (&gt;2-fold excess, estimated by assuming that &lt;100% of the primers were converted into the full-length PCR product, and that &lt;100% of it was recovered after gel purification). The length of the ligation products was verified by PAGE. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> Step 5. PCR. One-third of the ligation product was amplified by PCR with the new 3&prime; fixed sequence primer C (sequence shown above) and primer A&plus;FokI (which introduces the FokI site into the old 5&prime; fixed sequence, and relates to primer A as B&plus;FokI relates to B). Higher concentrations of the primers were used in this PCR (10 &mgr;M each, instead of 1 &mgr;M, as in all other PCRs in this study). This served to provide an excess of primer C over cC (cC is complementary to C, and was carried over from the ligation in step 4). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> Only one of the two major ligation products can be amplified in PCR with primers C and A&plus;FokI, namely, the product in which the duplex of oligonucleotides C and cC has been ligated in one of the 2 possible orientations with respect to the FokI-digested library DNA molecule. A single T was added to the 3&prime; end of oligonucleotide cC, as shown above, in order to create a single base overhang in the C-cC duplex. Under the experimental conditions, adding a single overhanging T directs ligation more toward the desired orientation: blunt end to blunt end, as opposed to the undesired orientation of overhanging end to blunt end (data not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> Step 6. Changing the 5&prime; fixed sequence. DNA was purified as in the third paragraph of step 1, and then steps 2-5 for 3&prime; fixed sequence were essentially repeated for the 5&prime; fixed sequence. For the PCR in step 5, primers for the new fixed sequences were used: C (step 4, above) and D (5&prime;-gaaattaatacgactcactatagggaaagcccacgcc-3&prime; (SEQ ID NO:330)). The resulting molecules had both fixed sequences replaced with the new ones, with both tails removed entirely. One such molecule is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</cross-reference>. After changing the fixed sequences, SELEX proceeded as in &ldquo;Conventional SELEX,&rdquo; with 1 &mgr;M RNA and 100 nM MS2 CP. In the SELEX experiment where the new fixed sequences were chosen without the help of the STOGEN computer program (see below), the primers that correspond to C and D were, respectively, 5&prime;-atgtcgggccgccgaa-3&prime; (SEQ ID NO:331) and 5&prime;-gaaattaatacgactcactatagggcccggc gcataa-3&prime; (SEQ ID NO:332). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> rffG End-Point Analysis </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> To find the sequences of the library molecules that share the rffG site, the method described previously (Singer et al., 1997, supra) was used. Briefly, the starting library DNA was amplified by PCR with the library primer B, and the genomic primer from rffG gene (5&prime;-bbbcactgagcatcagccag-3&prime; (SEQ ID NO:333); b stands for biotin). The products that contained the genomic primer were purified on immobilized streptavidin. Their complementary strands were eluted, and amplified using primer B and a nested genomic rffG primer (5&prime;-bbbatcagccagactgtgtca-3&prime; (SEQ ID NO:334); the sequence in common is in boldface). The PCR products were purified on immobilized streptavidin again, eluted, and amplified with uracil-primers for subsequent cloning and sequencing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> Binding Analysis </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> The MS2 replicase fragment (the natural MS2 CP binding site; <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) was chemically synthesized, amplified by PCR and labeled by in vitro transcription as above. The resulting RNA molecule contained the fragment of the original MS2 sequence (as published in the GenBank) with the same fixed sequences (for primers C and D) attached to it as in the real SELEX isolates. The molecule also matched the SELEX isolates in length (70 nucleotides, with most isolates being 60-80 nucleotides). The MS2 CP binding site was positioned approximately in the middle of the molecule. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> The RNAMOT site Nos. 8, 12 and 14 (Table 3) were amplified from <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>genomic DNA template by PCR. The transcribed RNA molecules had the MS2 CP binding sites positioned approximately in the middle (just as they were positioned for simplicity when their predicted secondary structures were examined). The molecules also had the same fixed sequences, and were 70 nucleotides long. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> Labeled RNA (0.1 nM) was bound to MS2 CP in variable excess concentrations as above, but without pre-filtering, at 24-25&deg; C. Each binding reaction was filtered through nitrocellulose (0.45 micron pore, from Bio-Rad) using a Bio-Dot apparatus (Bio-Rad) and washed with 0.5 ml of the binding buffer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> STOGEN: A Computer Program to Choose New Fixed Sequences </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> To reduce the possible influence of the fixed sequences on the outcome of the SELEX experiments, a computer program to design new fixed sequences was developed. The program (available by anonymous ftp from /usr/local/ftp/pub/STOGEN at beagle.colorado.edu or by e-mailing to timur&commat;colorado.edu or javornik&commat;nexstar.com) takes as input the old fixed sequences. It generates possible candidates for the new fixed sequences, using 4 heuristic rules with user-adjustable parameters (see below). For computational efficiency, the program does not generate and test all possible sequences of a given length, but rather randomly generates a subset of sequences, tests them, and repeats the process again, until it arrives at sequences that conform to all of the rules (hence the name of the program&mdash;STOGEN, short for stochastic generator). The STOGEN rules are: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> 1. The new fixed sequences should have approximately the same annealing temperatures to the primers as the old fixed sequences, in order to facilitate amplification. Therefore, the new fixed sequences have the same length and the same number of G&plus;C as the old ones (Wu et al. (1991) Prog Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 40:185-220). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> 2. The new fixed sequences should form among themselves as little secondary structure as possible. In addition to potentially influencing SELEX, the structure may hinder either PCR or reverse transcription. The longest allowed continuous stem was usually limited to 3 base pairs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> 3. The new fixed sequences should share as little similarity as possible to the old ones. Thus, all the molecules that used the old fixed sequences for binding, will be lost in subsequent rounds of SELEX. Two criteria were used to this end: shared sequence size and position-by-position identity. The maximum allowed size of any sequence in common between the old and the new fixed sequences was usually set to 2 nucleotides. That is, if the old fixed sequence contains AUG, the new one may contain AU or UG, but not AUG. The only exception is the invariant starting GGG, required for optimal transcription yield (Milligan et al. (1987) Nucleic Acids Res. 15:8783-98). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> Also, position-by-position identity between the old and the new fixed sequences is limited. Since the parts of the fixed sequences closest to the insert participate in binding more often, identity is weighted by position, assigning greater penalty to positions closest to the insert. The weight function was derived by evaluating the fixed sequence participation data from 11 different SELEX experiments. Seven experiments were randomized sequence SELEXes for protein binders (Brown et al (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272:14969-74; Brown and Gold (1995) Biochemistry 34:14765-74; Burke et al. (1996) J. Mol. Biol. 264:650-66; Jellinek et al. (1994) Biochemistry 33:10450-6; Kubik et al. (1994) Nucleic Acids Res. 22:2619-26; Tuerk et al. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:6988-92; Tuerk &amp; MacDougal-Waugh (1993) Gene 137(1):33-9), two were genomic SELEX experiments (experiments 1 and 2, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) described in the present paper, one was SELEX for small-molecule binders (Burke et al. (1997) Chem. Biol. 4:833-43), and one was SELEX for RNA best cleaved with an endonuclease (Jayasena et al. (1996) Biochemistry 35:2349-56). In every SELEX experiment, the data generated for the individual isolates by boundary experiments or by any other similarly reliable method, were used. Although each SELEX experiment yielded very different results, the cumulative data from all of these SELEX experiments is approximated well by the formula:</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>f&equals;</italic></highlight>0.027&plus;2.0&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;8</superscript></highlight>&times;(<highlight><italic>n&minus;</italic></highlight>20)<highlight><superscript>6</superscript></highlight>, for <highlight><italic>n&lE;</italic></highlight>10,</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> and</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>f&equals;</italic></highlight>0.022, for <highlight><italic>n&gt;</italic></highlight>10.</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> Here f is the relative frequency of participation of each position within the fixed sequence, and n is the position (counting from the insert, n&equals;1 is the first fixed nucleotide). The program assigns the identity score for each position to be f, if the new fixed sequence and the old one both have the same nucleotide at this position, and to 0&mdash;otherwise. New fixed sequences with a particularly high total identity score (&equals;the sum of the identity scores over all positions) are avoided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> 4. The new fixed sequences should have minimal potential to form secondary structure with the genomic insert. In most cases, the sequence of the genomic insert is not known in advance. Hence, the generalized potential to form secondary structure is evaluated in the following way. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> For each of the candidates for the new fixed sequences, the free energy of annealing to its complement is calculated (the complement used here includes A:U, G:C and G:U base pairs). For example, the sequence AC thus has one possible perfect complement, GU. The sequence GU has 4 possible perfect complements: AC, AU, GC and GU, since U can base pair with either A or G, and G&mdash;with either C or U. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> The sum of free energies of all possible complements annealing to the fixed sequence is calculated using the Turner rules (Serra &amp; Turner (1995) Methods Enzymol. 259:242-61). The more negative the sum, the larger the potential to form secondary structure. Sequences with a particularly negative sum of free energies (typically, G, U-rich) are avoided. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> Binding Sites from the MS2 CP SELEX Agree with the Known Consensus Structure </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> A library of genomic DNA was prepared from <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>B by random primer extension (Singer et al. (1997) Nucleic Acids Research 25:781-786). The library contained approximately 65 nucleotide genomic inserts flanked by fixed sequences, which serve as primer annealing sites for amplification. Insert refers to the genomic sequence located in the library molecule between the two fixed sequences. In each round of SELEX, the transcribed library was allowed to bind MS2 CP, and then the bound RNA was amplified. In SELEX experiment 1, the DNA was cloned and sequenced after 5 rounds, when the optimal binding was observed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> Out of 25 isolates sequenced, 12 had the predicted consensus (Witherell et al. (1991) Prog Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 40:185-220) binding site (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>), which could be identified either by folding by hand, or by computerized Zuker-Turner folding (Genetics Computer Group, <highlight><italic>Program Manual for the Wisconsin Package, </italic></highlight>8<highlight><superscript>th </superscript></highlight>edition, Madison, Wis., 1994; Serra and Turner (1995) Methods Enzymol. 259:242-61; Zuker (1989) Science 244:48-52). Of the 12 isolates, 10 were found in the GenBank, which included the complete <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>sequence, by the BLAST search (Altschul et al. (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-410) using the network service at the NCBI (Genetics Computer Group, <highlight><italic>Program Manual for the Wisconsin Package, </italic></highlight>8<highlight><superscript>th </superscript></highlight>edition, Madison, Wis., 1994). The remaining 2 isolates did not have significant similarities to any sequences in GenBank, and probably resulted from contamination of the starting genomic library DNA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> Surprisingly, the genomic sequences, obtained from the GenBank, that corresponded to 9 out of the 10 isolates with the consensus binding site, did not contain this site. Thus, they were not predicted to bind MS2 CP. In other words, 9 out of the 10 isolates were experimentally induced artifacts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> One of the frequent artifacts is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2B and 2C</cross-reference>. In this isolate, the fixed sequence participates in forming the binding site. This isolate also has several mutations in the insert that participate in forming the binding site. All of the mutations are at the junction with the fixed sequence. This junction is much more prone to mutations than the rest of the genomic insert because of the random sequence introduced when the randomized primer misannealed during library construction (Singer et al. (1997) Nucleic Acids Research 25:781-786). The mutated region of the genomic insert at its junction with the fixed sequence is termed the tail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> In the isolate shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2B and 2C</cross-reference>, as well as in most other isolates, the tail and the fixed sequence both participate in forming the binding site. The corresponding genomic sequences from the GenBank were very different from the tails and, obviously, from the fixed sequences, and thus were unable to form the binding site. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> Note that the binding of the genomic sequences was not actually measured, but rather inferred from the sequence. The sequence alone should predict the binding fairly well, as confirmed in this paper (see below), and as shown earlier by others (Schneider et al. (1992) J. Mol. Biol. 228:862-9; Stockley et al. (1995) Nucleic Acids Res. 23:2512-8; Uhlenbeck et al. (1983) J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1:539-52; Witherell et al. (1991) Prog Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 40:185-220). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> Annealing of the Complementary Oligonucleotides Reduces the Fraction of SELEX Artifacts </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> It was desirable to reduce the fraction of isolates in which the fixed sequences, or tail, or both, participate in binding. The first method to solve this problem was designed to reduce the participation in binding of only the fixed sequences, but not the tails. The genomic SELEX described in Example 1 above (termed conventional genomic SELEX) was carried out for 3 rounds. In each subsequent round, two DNA oligonucleotides complementary to the two fixed sequences were annealed prior to binding of RNA to MS2 CP (Table 1). SELEX with annealing was carried out for 3 rounds (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, SELEX experiment 2). Switching from &ldquo;no annealing&rdquo; to &ldquo;annealing,&rdquo; rather than doing all 6 rounds &ldquo;annealing,&rdquo; should reduce the fraction of isolates that require annealing for binding to MS2 CP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> Out of 35 sequenced isolates from &ldquo;annealing&rdquo; SELEX, 26 had the consensus binding site, and 17 of those 26 were found in the GenBank. Of these 17 isolates, 7 (40%) had a consensus binding site present in the corresponding genomic sequence from the GenBank, and the rest were artifacts as described above. The fraction of artifacts in which fixed sequences, but not tails, participated in binding, decreased only by approximately twofold. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> Changing Fixed Sequences Eliminates Most of the SELEX Artifacts </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> The second, and more efficient, method of reducing the artifacts consists of changing the fixed sequences sometime through the course of SELEX, replacing them with entirely new fixed sequences, and at the same time eliminating the &ldquo;tails&rdquo; altogether (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> FokI endonuclease was used to cut the 3&prime; fixed sequence and the tail of the library DNA after round 3 of conventional genomic SELEX. FokI cuts at a specific distance (9-13 nucleotides, regardless of their sequence) away from its recognition site, which was introduced in the fixed sequence near its junction with the genomic insert. After digestion with FokI, the overhang at the cut end of the library DNA was extended with Klenow, and blunt-end ligated to the new 3&prime; fixed sequence, which was a duplex of synthetic oligonucleotides. The ligation product was amplified by PCR, and the whole procedure was repeated again&mdash;this time to change the 5&prime; fixed sequence. The new fixed sequences were chosen using a specially developed computer program termed STOGEN (see Example 1). The sequences may also be chosen manually, with the careful consideration of all the important factors involved (discussed in Example 1). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> After changing the 5&prime; and 3&prime; fixed sequences, SELEX was preformed in 2 different ways in parallel: (1) with annealing of the DNA oligonucleotides complementary to the new fixed sequences, and (2) without any complementary oligonucleotides, as in conventional genomic SELEX (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, SELEX experiments 3 and 4). Both SELEX experiments gave virtually identical results. After 2 and 3 rounds of SELEX with the new fixed sequences, 101 isolates were sequenced. Out of 101 isolates, 76 had the consensus binding site, and 75 out of these 76 were found in the GenBank. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> The fixed sequences never made any part of the consensus binding site. Neither did the tails, except for 1 artifact. Practically all tails had been successfully removed by FokI. Internal, rather than tail, mutations caused 2 artifacts. This is comparable to the frequency of any mutations in genomic SELEX (1.7 mutations per 100 nucleotides after 5-6 SELEX rounds, data not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> Five isolates closely resembled the consensus binding site, but had mutations in those parts that do not contact the coat protein directly (Valegard et al. (1994) Nature 371:623-6; Valegard et al. (1997) J. Mol. Biol. 270:724-38). None of the F6-like, 3 nucleotide loop variants, which binds more weakly than the consensus binding site (Convery et al. (1998) Nat. Struct. Biol. 5:133-9), has been found in the genomic SELEX experiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> All of the SELEX isolates with the MS2 CP consensus binding site (Table 2) had the higher-affinity RNCA tetraloop instead of the lower-affinity RNUA tetraloop of the natural MS2 CP binding site on MS2 mRNA (Johansson (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95:9244-9; Lowary and Uhlenbeck (1987) Nucleic Acids Res. 15:10483-93). As expected, these SELEX isolates bound better than the natural binding site, as measured by the nitrocellulose filter-binding assay (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). Four most frequent isolates without the consensus binding site were also tested. Three isolates did not bind MS2 CP (a typical one is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>), and one bound nitrocellulose and also, weakly, MS2 CP (data not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> The consensus of the isolates in Table 2, with consideration of their frequencies in the selected pool, is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>. Most of the differences between the SELEX consensus site and the consensus site in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, should make the binding tighter, or the binding structure more stable (Uhlenbeck et al. (1983) J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 2:539-52; Witherell et al. (1991) Prog Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 40:185-220). This SELEX consensus also agrees with the data from the randomized sequence SELEX (Schneider et al. (1992) J. Mol. Biol. 228:862-9). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> The isolates that bind MS2 CP were located in 8 distinct genomic sites. Locations of the MS2 CP binding sites within the corresponding genes did not follow any obvious pattern, with some sites being on the sense, and some on the antisense strand. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> Fifty-six isolates were from the sense strand of mRNA of the rffG gene (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</cross-reference>). These molecules were not only the most frequent, but also the tightest binders among the SELEX isolates. The corresponding genomic fragment (without the fixed sequences) also bound MS2 CP well (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). The rffG open reading frame, o355, was mistakenly labeled rffE in the GenBank version 90.0 (Marolda and Valvano (1995) J. Bacteriol. 177:5539-46). Encoded by rffG is the enzyme dTDP-D-glucose 4,6 dehydratase. This enzyme participates in formation of O-specific polysaccharide, or O antigen, which, joined together with lipid A via core oligosaccharide, forms lipopolysaccharide in the bacterial outer membrane (Raetz, <highlight><italic>Escherichia Coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology, </italic></highlight>2<highlight><superscript>nd </superscript></highlight>edition, 1996, pp. 1035-1063). The enzyme also participates in formation of the polysaccharide part of the enterobacterial common antigen, a cell surface glycolipid (Rick &amp; Silver, <highlight><italic>Escherichia Coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology, </italic></highlight>2<highlight><superscript>nd </superscript></highlight>edition, 1996, pp. 104-122). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> Library Composition Partially Explains SELEX Results </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> It is worth noting that 93% of all the rffG isolates were virtually copies of each other, with the 15 nucleotide consensus binding site always starting at any of only 4 adjacent positions (or adjacent &ldquo;registers&rdquo;) within the 40 nucleotide insert. The site was predicted ideally to shift everywhere within the 40&minus;15&plus;1&equals;26 available registers within the insert. The fact that it did not, was possibly due to a bias in the starting library. The end-point analysis (Singer et al. (1997) Nucleic Acids Research 25:781-786) showed that more than half of the molecules of the starting library have end-points that correspond to the registers of the majority (93%) of all rffG SELEX isolates (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference>). Such clustering of end-points might have been caused by annealing of the fixed part of the library primer to the <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>DNA during the library construction (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> Comparison of the MS2 CP Binding Sites Predicted by the Computer Search with the Sites Found by SELEX </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> Other sites in the <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>genome that bind to MS2 CP were much less frequent than rffG, in these (Table 2) and prior rounds of SELEX (data not shown). This raised the question about the efficiency of finding all potentially biologically important binding sites. To check if any other binding sites were missed by the SELEX process, a search was performed for the MS2 CP consensus binding site (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>) in the complete <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>genome, using the RNAMOT program (Gautheret et al. (1990) Comput. Appl. Biosci. 6:325-31). The search revealed 412 matches to the consensus binding site, each of which theoretically binds the coat protein as well as, or better than, the wild-type MS2 mRNA. Only 280 sites were expected by chance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> To narrow this list to only the tightest binding sites, the SELEX consensus binding site (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</cross-reference>) was searched for. It is based on the genomic SELEX isolates, and is more restrictive than the consensus binding site, which is based on the studies of mutants. RNAMOT found 21 such &ldquo;SELEX consensus&rdquo; binding sites (Table 3). Only 3 sites were expected to be found at random. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> Three binding sites were found both by SELEX and by RNAMOT program, including the major (rffG) SELEX isolate. Most of the minor SELEX isolates were not found by RNAMOT. Some of these did not fit the SELEX consensus used for searching the database. For example, had G:U pairs been allowed in the consensus, these sites would have been found, too. Others, like isolate Nos. 7 and 9 from Table 2, were not in the database. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> Most of the RNAMOT sites were not found by the SELEX process. It is possible that some of them were under-represented in the starting library, or that they were poorly amplifiable in the SELEX process, or that they bound MS2 CP weakly because the RNA folds into alternate, non-binding, structures within the context of a larger molecule. It is unlikely that these sites were entirely absent from the library. In a previous experiment, all of the 13 other independently tested genomic fragments were successfully amplified by PCR from the same <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>genomic library (Singer et al. (1997) Nucleic Acids Research 25:781-786). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> To find out why the RNAMOT sites were not isolated in SELEX, 20-40 most stable predicted secondary structures of some RNAMOT sites were compared to those of the actual SELEX isolates. In addition, structures of the rffG binding site present in all possible registers within the insert were examined. There appeared only a weak correlation between structures and the frequency of isolation in SELEX. The absolute free energy of the binding site structure, or of the whole molecule, was not correlated with its isolation in SELEX. However, the major rffg isolate had a fairly long stem that supported the binding site (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</cross-reference>), relative to other SELEX isolates, and to many other rffG registers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> Perhaps a longer stem provides extra stability to the correct binding site structure and thus reduces the fraction of molecules folded into other, non-binding, structures. In the randomized sequence SELEX for R17 coat protein binders, Schneider and coworkers also found mostly long (7 base pairs) and stable (mostly G:C or C:G base pairs) stems (Schneider et al. (1992) J. Mol. Biol. 228:862-9). Also, in the regular MS2 CP genomic SELEX experiment (without changing the fixed sequences or annealing of oligonucleotides; <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, experiment 1), many isolates used fixed sequences not only to form the consensus binding site, but also to extend its stem past the minimum 5 base pairs. In SELEX experiments 3 and 4, the fixed sequences, while not forming the consensus binding site, sometimes extended the stem to longer than the minimal 5 base pairs. In SELEX experiment 5, the new fixed sequences were chosen without STOGEN, and their potential to base-pair to each other and to the insert was accidentally overlooked. In most of the isolates from this SELEX experiment, the fixed sequences extended the minimal stem by additional 12 base pairs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> However, when RNAMOT sites were considered as well, longer stems did not correlate with the frequency of isolation in SELEX. For example, site Nos. 8, 12 and 14 (Table 3), which were found by RNAMOT, are also predicted to have long stems, just like the most frequent genomic SELEX isolates (Nos. 1, 2 and 3, Table 2), and yet they were not found in the SELEX process. They fit the randomized sequence SELEX consensus stems (Schneider et al. (1992) J. Mol. Biol. 228:862-9) as well or better than the most frequent genomic SELEX isolates. They also bind MS2 CP rather well. Site Nos. 8 and 14 bind to MS2 CP with affinities between those of SELEX isolate Nos. 1 and 2 (data not shown). Site No. 12 binds MS2 CP with affinity only slightly weaker than SELEX isolate No. 6. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> In short, the only parameters that apparently affect isolation of any particular molecule in the SELEX process are the molecule&apos;s affinity and its frequency in the starting library. Perhaps the sites predicted by RNAMOT, but not found in SELEX, were less frequent in the library. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> Examples 1 and 2 demonstrate methods for generating nucleic acid ligands in which the participation of the fixed region in binding to the target is minimized or eliminated by changing fixed region sequences or by annealing of complementary nucleotides to the fixed regions. These methods were demonstrated using the Genomic SELEX methodology; however, it would be known by one of skill in the art that these methods are not specific to the Genomic SELEX methodology, but can by applied to the more broad SELEX methodology. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> The SELEX procedure has been described in detail in the SELEX Patent Applications. The DNA templates contained either 40 or 30 random nucleotides, flanked by 5&prime; and 3&prime; constant regions for primer annealing sites for PCR and cDNA synthesis (Table 5). Truncation SELEX started with VEGF round 12 VT30 or TGF&bgr;1 round 13 40N7 or 30N7 pools. These pools were described previously (see Ruckman et al. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273:20556-67 and U.S. Ser. No. 09/046,247, filed Mar. 23, 1998). Selection conditions for truncation SELEX are summarized in Tables 6A-D. RNA pools were prepared by transcription with about 5 &mgr;M DNA template, 5 units/&mgr;l T7 RNA polymerase, 40 mM Tris-HCl (pH8), 12 mM MgCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, 5 mM DTT, 1 mM spermidine, 0.002% Triton X-100, 4% PEG 8000, 2-4 mM each 2&prime;OH ATP, 2&prime;OH GTP, 2&prime;F CTP, 2&prime;F UTP, and 0.25 &mgr;M &agr;<highlight><superscript>32</superscript></highlight>P-ATP (800 Ci/mmole). When necessary, RNA pools were prefiltered and/or preadsorbed with multiple layers of same nitrocellulose filter type used in the SELEX process in order to reduce the frequency of molecules selected for nitrocellulose binding. To prepare binding reactions, the RNA molecules were incubated with recombinant h TGF&bgr;1 in Dulbecco&apos;s Phosphate-Buffered Saline (DPBS) (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, Md.) containing 1 mM MgCl<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and 0.01% human serum albumin or with recombinant VEGF in TBS (Sambrook et al., <highlight><italic>Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, </italic></highlight>2<highlight><superscript>nd </superscript></highlight>Edition, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1989) containing 1 mM MgCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, 1 mM CaCl<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and 0.01% human serum albumin. Following incubation at 37&deg; C. (about 30 minutes) the protein-RNA complexes were partitioned from unbound RNA by capture on nitrocellulose. Nitrocellulose filter bound RNA was recovered by phenol/urea extraction. Pools were amplified by RT/PCR or PCR. Reverse transcriptions were done by AMV reverse transcriptase at 48&deg; C. for 60 minutes in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.3, 60 mM NaCl, 6 mM Mg(OAc)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, 10 mM DTT, 50 pmol DNA 3&prime; primer (3G7) (Table 5), 0.4 mM each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, and 1 unit/&mgr;l AMV RT. PCR amplifications were done with 2 &mgr;M each 3G7 and 5G7 primers (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9, 0.1% Triton X-100, 3 mM MgCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, 0.5 mM of each dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, 0.1 units/&mgr;l Taq DNA polymerase. Typically 15 cycles were used of 30 seconds denaturation at 95&deg; C., 30 seconds annealing at 60&deg; C., and 1 minute elongation at 72&deg; C. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0208" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0208&rsqb;</number> To partition the protein-RNA complexes away from uncomplexed RNA, the binding reactions were filtered through nitrocellulose/cellulose acetated mixed matrix, 0.45 &mgr;m pore size filter disks, type HA, (Millipore, Co., Bedford, Mass.). For filtration, the filters were placed onto a vacuum manifold and wetted by aspirating 5 ml of binding buffer. The binding reactions were aspirated through the filters, then filters were washed with 5-50 ml of binding buffer (without BSA) and counted in a scintillation counter (Beckmann). When necessary, nitrocellulose filters were preblocked with 2 ml of PBS&plus;0.01% BSA to reduce background binding of RNA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0209" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0209&rsqb;</number> Nitrocellulose partitioning was also used for determining the equilibrium dissociation constants of RNA ligands to hVEGF or hTGF&bgr;1. High specific activity transcripts for affinity determination were prepared in 20 &mgr;l reactions containing 5 &mgr;l crude PCR product and 15 &mgr;l transcription mix (3.9 &mgr;l 5&times;transcription buffer, 0.1 &mgr;l 1 mM ATP, 0.2 &mgr;l 100 mM GTP, 0.6 &mgr;l 100 mM 2&prime;F-CTP, 0.6 &mgr;l 100 mM 2&prime;F-UTP, 2.5 &mgr;l &agr;-<highlight><superscript>32</superscript></highlight>P-ATP (800 Ci/mmol, NEN, Boston, Mass.), 0.5 &mgr;l T7 RNA polymerase (at 14.7 &mgr;M)). Following incubation (1 hour&mdash;overnight), transcripts were gel purified from denaturing polyacrylamide TBE gels (for example 10% or 15%, Novex, San Diego, Calif.) and were used at about 25,000-50,000 cpm per 8-12 point binding curve. Binding curves obtained by nitrocellulose filtration indicated that RNA pools and some RNA ligands bind monophasically while others bind biphasically. Biphasic binding can be described as the binding of two affinity species derived from the same ligand sequence that can fold into alternate structures that are kinetically trapped and are not in equilibrium. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0254" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0254&rsqb;</number> For application of RNaseH site specific cleavage of RNA to truncation SELEX where 2&prime;F modified nucleotides are present, it is necessary that RNaseH is able to digest 2&prime;F-deoxyribopyrimidine substituted RNA. In addition, in order to eliminate the bulk of the 3&prime; primer binding site, it would be desirable for the RNaseH to accept targeting oligonucleotides that include the 2&prime;deoxyribonucleotide gap at its 3&prime; end. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0255" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0255&rsqb;</number> RNaseH is an enzyme that recognizes RNA-DNA hybrids and digests the RNA strand through an endonucleolytic mechanism (Hostomsky et al., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York, pp. viii, 499, 1993). RNaseH is a ubiquitous enzyme found in procaryotes and eukaryotes mechanism (Hostomsky et al., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York, pp. viii, 499, 1993). <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>encodes at least two RNaseH isotypes on separate genes (Itaya (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 87:8587-91). The <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>RNaseH1 is most extensively studied. The digestive mechanism of <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>RNaseH1 is similar to DNases where the 2&prime;OH group does not participate in the nucleophilic attack of the phosphodiester bond and the product ends are 3&prime;OH and 5&prime;P (Crooke et al. (1995) J. Biochemistry 312:599-608). It has been shown that <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>RNaseH1 could be used for site directed digestion of RNA using DNA molecules complementary to the site of digestion (Inoue et al. (1987) FEBS Letters 215:327-330). The digestion site could be targeted to a single position using chimeric targeting oligonucleotides containing regions of 2&prime;deoxyribonucleotides flanked by regions of 2&prime;OMe nucleotides (Inoue et al. (1987) FEBS Letters 215:327-330) taking advantage of the inability of the enzyme to digest RNA-2&prime;OMeRNA hybrids (Inoue et al. (1987) FEBS Letters 215:327-330; Lima and Crooke (1997) Biochemistry 36:390-398). The length of the 2&prime;deoxyribonucleotide region influences the function of the <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>RNaseH1 where the cleavage rate is decreased with diminishing number of contiguous 2&prime;deoxyribonucleotides, where no cleavage occurring with less than four contiguous 2&prime;deoxyribonucleotides (Monia et al. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268:14514-22; Crooke et al. (1995) J. Biochemistry 312:599-608). The site of cleavage by <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>RNaseH1 of RNA bound to chimeric oligonucleotide containing a 2&prime;deoxyribonucleotide region flanked by 2&prime;OMe-ribonucleotide regions, has been demonstrated to occur at the 3&prime; site of the RNA base found opposite to the most 5&prime; nucleotide of the 2&prime;deoxyribonucleotide region (Inoue et al. (1987) FEBS Letters 215:327-330; Crooke et al. (1995) J. Biochemistry 312:599-608; Lapham and Crothers (1996) RNA 2:289-296). Cleavage by <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>RNaseH1 can occur when the targeting chimeric oligonucleotide contains at least 4 contiguous 2&prime;deoxyribonucleotides in the middle or at the 5&prime; end (Inoue et al. (1987) FEBS Letters 215:327-330; Lapham and Crothers (1996) RNA 2:289-296), but not at the 3&prime; end (Inoue et al. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 87:8587-91) of the targeting chimeric oligonucleotide. Recently, different digestion specificities were found depending on the commercial source of RNaseH used, where RNaseH from Pharmacia (cat. &num;27-0894), Sigma (cat. R-6501) or Takarashuzo digest like the <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>RNaseH1, while RNaseH from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (cat. &num;786-349) cleaves at one base upstream of the expected site (Lapham et al. (1997) RNA3:950-951). The effect of 2&prime;F modifications was determined with <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>RNaseH1 in examples where the modified bases were at the targeting oligonucleotide. Full 2&prime;F modified targeting oligonucleotides reduced the overall affinity of RNaseH1 for the hybrid complex with RNA (Crooke et al. (1995) J. Biochemistry 312:599-608). Replacing 2&prime;OMe-deoxyribonucleotide positions of the chimeric targeting oligonucleotide (which include a gap of 2&prime;deoxyribonucleotides in the middle) with 2&prime;F-2&prime;deoxy-nucleotides reduced the initial cleavage rate by about 5 fold. The effect of 2&prime;F modification of the RNA substrate, instead of the targeting oligonucleotide, was determined only at a single site, namely at the site of cleavage and found to reduce the reaction rate by 1000-fold (Uchiyama et al. (1994) J. Mol. Biol. 243:782-791). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0256" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0256&rsqb;</number> The ability of <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>RNaseH obtained from Pharmacia and Roche Molecular Biochemicals to cleave 2&prime;F-deoxyribopyrimidine substituted RNA with chimeric oligonucleotides containing 11 or 12 2&prime;OMe-deoxyribonucleotides and a gap of 4 contiguous 2&prime;deoxyribonucleotides at either their 5&prime; or 3&prime; end (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>) was determined. The data show that only the enzyme from Roche Molecular Biochemicals had significant activity against the tested substrate. This enzyme can cleave with either the 5&prime;, the 3&prime;, or both targeting oligonucleotides and it requires the presence of the targeting oligonucleotide for activity. The enzyme from Pharmacia is largely inactive against the 2&prime;F-deoxyribopyrimidine substituted RNA showing only slight activity with only the 5&prime; primer consistent with RNaseH1 type activity. We determined the digestion specificity of the enzyme from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. We used two defined templates (VT30-07, and VT30-44) to generate in vitro 2&prime;F-deoxyribopyrimidine substituted RNA transcripts. Such transcripts were end labeled at either the 5&prime; or the 3&prime; end, and then treated with RNaseH (from Boheringer Mannhein) and the appropriate targeting oligonucleotide so that the 5&prime; and 3&prime; end labeled RNA was cleaved at its 3&prime; primer, or 5&prime; primer binding site, respectively. Digested RNA was then gel purified and analyzed on a sequencing gel along with full length RNA and size markers generated by alkaline partial hydrolysis of the corresponding end labeled RNA. Alkaline hydrolysis attacks only the unmodified positions in the RNA transcripts (2&prime;OH), thus these markers show the positions of purines within the transcript. The results are summarized in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. The data show that digestion at the 3&prime; position occurs at a single phosphodiester bond namely at the 5&prime; side of the base across the second base (from the 5&prime;) of the 2&prime;dexyribonucleotide gap in the 3&prime; targeting oligonucleotide. Digestion at the 5&prime; occurs at two positions, namely at the 5&prime; sides of the bases across the first and second base (from the 5&prime;) of the 2&prime;dexyribonucleotide gap in the 5&prime; targeting oligonucleotide. The digestion specificity at the 5&prime; end was confirmed by primer extension results (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>). Full length, and RNaseH digested RNA transcripts, as above, were used as extension templates of 5&prime; end labeled primers complementary to the 3&prime; primer binding site by AMV RT. All extension reactions were done in the presence of all four 2&prime;-deoxyribonucleotide-triphosphates. To facilitate mapping of the 3&prime; end to the template used, additional four extension reactions were done, each containing one of the four chain terminating 2&prime;dideoxyribonucleotide-triphosphates, ddATP, ddCTP, ddGTP, and ddTTP. Extended products were then analyzed on sequencing gels as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>. Extension products with all four 2&prime;deoxyribonucleotide-triphosphates show not only bands corresponding to the 5&prime; end of the template, but also bands corresponding to pause sites of RT. The pattern of pause sites is identical for the corresponding regions of the full length and truncated templates. In agreement with the previous experiment (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>), there are two bands corresponding to the 5&prime; end of the digested RNA, and the shorter bands it does not appear to be a pausing site since there is no corresponding band in the full length template. As expected, this second 5&prime; end is also present in all four chain termination reactions. Using the banding pattern of the chain termination reactions, the 5&prime; ends of the RNaseH digested RNAs could be mapped to the same positions mapped with the previous experiment. The results from the mapping experiments at the 5&prime; digestion site show that the <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>RNase H from Boheringer Mannhein in able to digest at the 3&prime; phosphodiester bond of a 2&prime;F-modified pyrimidine, consistent with the DNase type of reaction mechanism reported for <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>RNaseH1 (Crooke et al. (1995) J Biochemistry 312:599-608). Since the commercial source of RNaseH was shown to be important in cleavage specificity (Lapham et al. (1997) RNA 3:950-951), a panel of 4 RNaseH preparations were tested from different commercial suppliers (Epicenter cat &num;06100; Stratagene cat &num;600215; Roche Molecular Biochemicals cat &num;786357; and MBI Fermentas cat &num;EN0201) for their ability to digest 2&prime;F-deoxyribopyrimidine substituted RNA in the presence of either the 5&prime;, 3&prime;, or both targeting oligonucleotides described above. The results in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> show that only the enzyme from Roche Molecular Biochemicals was able to digest efficiently at both positions while the rest could digest efficiently only at the 5&prime; position, consistent with RNasH1 type of specificity. All enzymes showed some trace activity at the 3&prime; position with the MBI Fermentas lot being slightly more active. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0257" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0257&rsqb;</number> The data presented here clearly show for the first time, that RNase H can digest 2&prime;F-deoxyribopyrimidine substituted RNA at a specific site, directed by an appropriate targeting oligonucleotide. They also show, for the first time, that the Roche Molecular Biochemicals enzyme can use targeting oligonucleotides containing a gap of four contiguous 2&prime;deoxyribonucleotide bases at its 3&prime; end. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0258" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0258&rsqb;</number> Biotinylation of RNA </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0259" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0259&rsqb;</number> The truncation-SELEX-by-hybridization protocol requires the ability to biotinylate RNA following RNaseH digestion and affinity selection. There are several procedures that allow such RNA modification of which two were tested with RNaseH digested RNA, namely photo biotinylation and tailing by Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase (TdT). In addition, biotinylation scheme was developed using RNA ligase. Extent of biotinylation was determined by measuring streptavidin complexing of body labeled RNA by either gel shift, or capture to streptavidin loaded-beads (Pierce) or -membranes (Promega). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0260" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0260&rsqb;</number> For photobiotinylation and tailing reactions, commercially available kits (Clontech) were used per manufacturer&apos;s instructions. From these two methods only the tailing reaction was successful. By using the enzyme and reaction buffer from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Indianapolis, Ind.) it was observed that biotinylation efficiencies could be improved. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> shows typical biotinylation efficiencies by the tailing reaction, suggesting that under these experimental conditions the enzyme is saturated and biotinylates about 30% of the available truncated RNA at concentrations as low as 50 nM (0.5 pmoles in 10 &mgr;l binding reaction). A little higher efficiencies can be obtained (up to &tilde;45%) by using Biotin-N<highlight><superscript>6</superscript></highlight>-ddATP (cat &num;NEL508, NEN, Boston, Mass.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0261" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0261&rsqb;</number> As stated above, we developed a new RNA biotinylation method based on T4 RNA ligase. In analogy to the RNA labeling reaction utilizing <highlight><superscript>32</superscript></highlight>PCP (Cytidine 3&prime;,5&prime;-bis(phosphate), &lsqb;5&prime;-<highlight><superscript>32</superscript></highlight>P&rsqb;), two biotinylation substrates were used as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> obtained by phosphoramidite chemistry (Operon Technologies, Alameda, Calif.). Biotinylation results with two different transcripts (40N7 and TGF&bgr;1 ligand 4003) at two temperatures (4&deg; C. and 0&deg; C.) are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference>. These results show clear biotinylation reactions only with the longer biotinylation substrate used. To follow the reaction, the biotinylated short oligonucleotides were kinased using T4 polynucleotide kinase and &ggr;<highlight><superscript>32</superscript></highlight>P-ATP as described above. The presence of biotin was confirmed using streptavidin induced electroporetic mobility shifts of gel purified ligation products as described before. Estimated yields of this biotinylation reaction were about 80-90%. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0262" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0262&rsqb;</number> Specificity of Hybridization </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0263" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0263&rsqb;</number> The success of the truncation SELEX by hybridization depends on the ability of the selected biotinylated truncated RNA to specifically hybridized to its complementary sequence. The hybridization specificity of an evolved pool (VEGF Rd2), (Ruckman et al. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273:20556-67) in the presence of different amounts of excess salmon sperm DNA (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>) was determined. Briefly, VEGF VT30 Rd 12 RNA was RNaseH digested to remove 5&prime; and 3&prime; fixed regions and biotinylated using terminal transferase and biotin-dUTP. Biotinylated truncate RNA (0.3 pmoles) was mixed with 10 fold excess, 5&prime;-end-labelled ssDNA complementary strands and was hybridized overnight at 72&deg; C. in the presence of 0.1 mM C-TAB in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA. Reactions with competitor salmon sperm DNA at 1-, 10-, 100-, and 1000-&times; over biotinylated RNA were also included. The RNA, ssDNA, and salmon sperm DNA were denatured at 95&deg; C. and fast cooled prior to addition to hybridization reaction and incubation at 72&deg; C. Following hybridization, the nucleic acid was recovered by ethanol precipitation, mixed with streptavidin and analyzed on a native 1XTBE polyacrylamide gel. Hybrid formation is apparent in this gel system by a slower electrophoretic mobility of the labeled ssDNA due to complexing streptavidin through the hybridized biotinylated input RNA. The results clearly show that biotinylated RNA was able to hybridize to its complement even the presence of 1000 fold excess nonlabeled competitor DNA. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0264" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0264&rsqb;</number> Truncation-SELEX-by-Hybrid-Selection </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0265" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0265&rsqb;</number> The truncation SELEX by hybrid selection protocol was applied to two pools. The first pool, Round 12 VT30, was derived from the 30N7 random library, and was selected for binding to VEGF for 12 rounds (Ruckman et al. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273:20556-67). The second pool, Round 12 40N-TGF&bgr;1, was derived from the 40N7 random library, and was selected to bind TGF&bgr;1 for 12 rounds as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/046,247, filed Mar. 23, 1998. These pools were selected because removal of fixed regions did not completely eliminate binding to their respective targets. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22 and 23</cross-reference>. Determining the ability of the starting pools to retain binding after removal of the primer binding sites might be important because during the SELEX rounds truncatable ligands might be eliminated from the population by nontruncatable ligands that have better affinities for the target. This was found to be true with the TGF&bgr;1 pool (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>) where more advanced pools retained almost no binding following removal of their primer binding sites. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> there is little difference in the binding of the full length and truncated Rd12 pool. There is &gt;1000 fold better binding of the full length Rd16 pool compared to truncated Rd16 pool, while the Rd13 pool showed an intermediate binding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0266" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0266&rsqb;</number> Affinity selections were done as described in Example 3. The conditions of affinity selections are summarized in Tables 6A and 6B. The RNA used at each round was generated by RNaseH digestion as described in Example 3. We used two different methods to partition the hybrids following hybridization. For the VEGF pool, a gel shift method was used on native gels while for the TGF&bgr;1 pool streptavidin-agarose beads were used as described in Example 3. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0267" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0267&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference> shows typical results with the native gel shift partition method. As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24A</cross-reference> there is a clear streptavidin induced shift of labeled complementary ssDNA only when streptavidin is used. We excised the shifted material from &plus;SA lane, (designated Rd1) and the corresponding region from the lane where streptavidin was omitted (from &minus;SA lane, designated Rd1-ct). Both gel slices were crushed to recover any nucleic acid present and eluted material was subject to PCR amplification using the 5P7 and 3P7 primers as described in Example 3. Amplification results, at various numbers of cycles, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24B</cross-reference> indicate that as expected the &plus;SA lane contained more amplifiable nucleic acid since there is a significant amount of product generated after 9 PCR cycles. PCR results also show that the native gel partition method has some background since we were able to amplify gel shifted material from the &minus;SA lane. Both of these amplified pools (Rd1 and Rd1-ct) were transcribed and generated RNA was RNaseH digested and used for a second round of affinity selection and gel shift partition of hybridized molecules. As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24C</cross-reference> the &plus;SA lane of the Rd1 pool contained streptavidin shifted material as expected. However, the &minus;SA lane also contained shifted material suggesting that within one round molecules with altered mobility on native gels were selected. We designated such molecules as background. The evolution of &ldquo;background&rdquo; was more severe in the Rd1-ct pool presumably due to the sole presence of such molecules in the &minus;SA lane from the first round of this truncation SELEX experiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0268" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0268&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference> shows typical PCR amplification profiles observed with the streptavidin-agarose beads partition method. These results suggest good signal to noise ratios and during truncation SELEX rounds nonspecific binding of labeled ssDNA to the streptavidin beads were not observed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0269" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0269&rsqb;</number> As seen in Tables 6A and 6B improving signal to noise ratios and an increase of the amount of RNA binding to the target were observed suggesting the selection process was successful. Pools Rd1-VEGF, Rd1-ct-VEGF and Rd2-TGF&bgr;1 truncation by a hybridization SELEX experiment were cloned and sequenced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0270" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0270&rsqb;</number> RNA Sequences from the Truncation SELEX by Hybrid Selection </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0271" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0271&rsqb;</number> Twenty four clones from the Rd1-VEGF and Rd1-ct-VEGF were sequenced, and 70 clones from the Rd2-TGF&bgr;1 truncation by hybridization SELEX pools were sequenced. The sequences obtained, and their alignment, suggested family classification, and binding properties are summarized in Tables 9-11. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0272" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0272&rsqb;</number> Greater than half of the sequences from the two VEGF experiments could be classified into Family 1 and Family 3 identified in the previous SELEX experiment with VEGF (Ruckman et al. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273:20556-67). The remaining ligands represent orphan sequences although some have some limited homology to ligands from Family 2 of the original SELEX experiment. Family 2 from the Rd1-VEGF pool contained isolates of frequent ligands from the original SELEX experiment, namely VT30.3 and VT30.1. Interestingly their relative frequencies is opposite from the relative frequency seen in the original SELEX experiment but consistent in their binding phenotype in the presence or absence of their fixed sequences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0273" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0273&rsqb;</number> Sequences from the Rd2- TGF&bgr;1 truncation by hybridization SELEX pool can be assigned into ten groups, namely 9 families and a group of orphans. The largest family contains ligands that have been identified as nitrocellulose binding molecules in previous experiments (TGF&bgr;1 patent). The remaining families are rather small and they could be clonal derivatives of unique sequences by PCR mutations. Families 1 and 5 resemble families 3 and 1, respectively, from the TGF&bgr;1 SELEX described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/046,247, filed Mar. 23, 1998. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0274" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0274&rsqb;</number> Binding Properties of Ligands from the Truncation SELEX by Hybrid Selection </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0275" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0275&rsqb;</number> The binding activity of several ligands was determined by nitrocellulose filter binding, and data are summarized in Tables 9-11. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0276" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0276&rsqb;</number> Binding activities of ligands from the VEGF experiments were compared in the presence or absence of fixed sequences. Several ligands were also analyzed in the same way from the starting pool (Rd12 VT30) as shown in Table 12. Ligands from all pools included example of both monophasic and biphasic binding. Each ligand was then scored and classified into five groups as follows: (1) ligands that lose significant affinity for VEGF upon removal of their fixed sequences; (2) molecules with affinities for VEGF somewhat affected (positively or negatively) upon removal of their fixed sequences; (3) molecules that gain significant affinity for VEGF upon removal of their fixed sequences; (4) molecules with affinities for VEGF not affected upon removal of their fixed sequences; and (5) non-binding ligands either with or without fixed sequences. For quantitative comparison, the data were analyzed in % plateau vs Kd values (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>). For biphasic curves, values of the major affinity component were used. The data points from the full-length ligands define an area representing the average affinity of the full length population. The graphs are divided into four quadrants (I, II, III, and IV) according to this average affinity where quadrant I represents low Kds and high plateaus (optimum affinities). The remaining three quadrants represent sub-optimal affinities with quadrant IV being the worst. If the analyzed population includes ligands that lose affinity upon removal of the fixed sequences, then affinity points will migrate suboptimal quadrants if affinity measurements were done in the absence of the fixed sequences. The data (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>) show that the majority of affinity points of the starting population occupy the sub-optimum affinity quadrants while the majority of affinity points of the selected population occupy the optimum affinity quadrants. As expected the control population shows a distribution similar to the starting population. Comparison of the frequencies of ligands in each quadrant is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>. These data clearly show that Truncation SELEX by hybrid selections, within one round, shifted the population frequencies so truncatable ligands become more abundant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0277" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0277&rsqb;</number> Since in the original TGF&bgr;1 SELEX we did not isolate any truncatable ligands, finding any truncatable ligand in the truncation SELEX pools would be an indication of the successful application of the methods described here. The binding of the ligands from the TGF&bgr;1 truncation SELEX was determined only after RNaseH digestions and the data are summarized in Table 11. More than half (52%) of ligands tested bound the target with high affinity in the absence of fixed sequences. Sample binding curves are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference>. Truncation SELEX did not only identified truncatable nucleic acid ligands that can bind TGF&bgr;1 but also nucleic acid ligands that could be TGF&bgr;1 inhibitors. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference> shows the inhibition of TGF&bgr;1 by ligand 70 from the TGF&bgr;1 Rd2 truncation SELEX by hybridization. This ligand causes full inhibition with an approximate Ki of 74.6 nM while a control sequence show no inhibition with an estimated Ki of worse than 1000 fold compared to ligand 70. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0278" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0278&rsqb;</number> Ligation of 3&prime; Primer Binding Sequence </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0279" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0279&rsqb;</number> One of the essential steps of the truncation SELEX by ligation process is the introduction of the 3&prime; fixed sequence at the 3&prime; end of the selected RNA by ligation. The ability of T4 RNA ligase to catalyze such a reaction utilizing RNA transcripts generated by two different templates (35N-Nae and 35N-Bsm) was determined as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference>. Before transcription, the templates were digested by the corresponding restriction enzyme (BsmI or NaeI). Transcription was done with &agr;-<highlight><superscript>32</superscript></highlight>P-ATP and 2&prime;F-pyrimidine-triphosphates to generate body labeled 2&prime;F modified transcripts. In addition, the ability of bridging complementary oligonucleotides to improve reaction yields was tested. Oligonucleotides used in this ligation experiment are shown in Table 13. Ligation oligonucleotides were designed to include three biotin residues at their 3&prime; end to allow the measurement of the ligation efficiency by gel shift and were also synthesized with phosphates at their 5&prime; end. Bridging oligonucleotides were designed to be complementary to the 5&prime; end of the ligation oligonucleotide and to include a 6N random region at their 3&prime; ends to allow hybridization at the RNA template thus helping in aligning and holding the two participating templates (the RNA and the 3&prime; fixed sequence oligonucleotide) in juxtaposition to facilitate their ligation. Oligonucleotides 3G7RC and 3G7R6 were used with the 35N-Nae RNA while 3LBsmC and 3LBsm with the 3N-Bsm RNA. Ligation reactions were set as described in the materials and methods and ligation efficiency was determined by quantitation of the residual transcript (TR) and the ligated product (LP) as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference>. Control lanes showing streptavidin induced gel shift also confirmed correct ligation products. In these control lanes, the only way that streptavidin could cause gel retardation of the body labeled transcripts would be by the action of T4 RNA ligase causing the covalent attachment of the biotinylated oligodeoxynucleotide to the labeled RNA. 66% and 55% ligation efficiency was observed for the 35N Nae RNA in the absence and presence of the bridge oligonucleotide, respectively. Similarly, the ligation efficiency for the 35N Bsm RNA was 78% and 41% in the absence and presence of the bridge oligonucleotide, respectively. These results clearly demonstrate that T4 RNA ligase can very efficiently add 3&prime; fixed sequences to 2&prime;F modified RNA in the absence of a bridging oligonucleotide. This method was routinely used in the truncation SELEX by ligation scheme. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0281" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0281&rsqb;</number> A second essential step of the truncation SELEX by ligation process is the introduction of the 5&prime; fixed sequence to the selected RNA. There are two ways that this can be accomplished. One way is to attach the 5&prime; fixed sequence to the 5&prime; end of the selected RNA using T4 DNA ligase and a bridge oligonucleotide. The second way relies on the same type of reaction where the complement of the 5&prime; fixed sequence is attached to the 3&prime; end of the cDNA copy of the selected RNA. This cDNA copy is generated following ligation of the 3&prime; fixed sequence as described above and RT reaction using a primer complementary to the introduced 3&prime; fixed sequence. Both of these approaches were tested (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0282" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0282&rsqb;</number> For ligation at the 5&prime; end of 2&prime;F modified RNA, lightly body labeled transcript generated as above on the 35N Bsm template was used. This transcript was then phosphatased by calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, cat &num;1097075) as described above to remove the phosphate structures generated by transcription initiation (usually a tri- or di-phosphate). The phosphatased RNA was then kinased with T4 polynucleotide kinase and &ggr;<highlight><superscript>32</superscript></highlight>P-ATP as described above and then used as a substrate in ligation reactions with T4 DNA ligase from two vendors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, cat &num;0481220 and New England Biolabs, cat &num;202S) containing the oligonucleotide 5G7NOT7 and the bridge oligonucleotide 5G7RC at 20 and 50 fold excess over the RNA, respectively (sequences of DNA oligonucleotides used are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference>. Ligation reactions were set at different concentrations of 2&prime;F modified RNA (two of which are shown in FIG. 35 and were incubated at 4&deg; C. for 16 hours. Following ligation, the reaction products were analyzed on denaturing (7 M urea) 10% polyacrylamide gels. The data clearly show that under these reaction conditions ligation occurs with at least 50% efficiency at RNA concentrations 25-50 nM and both enzyme lots were equivalent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0283" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0283&rsqb;</number> For ligation at the 3&prime; end of the cDNA, 2&prime;F RNA transcripts from VT30 round 12 pool were reverse transcribed using appropriate primer in the presence of &agr;-<highlight><superscript>32</superscript></highlight>P-dCTP (NEN, 800 Ci/mmol cat &num;BLU013A). Labeled cDNA was ligated to preannealed 5G7RC Linker/5&prime;N7 or 5N7 Linker/5N7 bridge as described in Example 3 and ligation products were analyzed on denaturing (7M urea) 10% polyacrylamide gels. The linker oligonucleotides were in 2- or 5-fold excess over the cDNA while the bridge oligos were at 3- or 7.5 fold excess. The data shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference> show that ligation reactions occurred with varied efficiencies. The set that included a fixed sequence bridge had better yields of about 42% and 46% for the 1:2 and 1:5 ratio of cDNA to linker oligonucleotide, respectively. The ligation efficiencies with the bridge sequence containing 5 random positions were about 15% at the 1:5 ratio of cDNA to linker oligonucleotide. During truncation by ligation SELEX rounds we used the ligation to the cDNA method to introduce the 5&prime; fixed sequence to the truncated RNA since the ligation at the 5&prime; end of the RNA would require additional enzymatic manipulations at each step, namely phosphatase treatment and kination. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0285" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0285&rsqb;</number> We applied the truncation SELEX by ligation protocol to three pools namely, the same two pools used for the truncation SELEX by hybrid selection protocol and in addition the round 12 30N-TGF&bgr;1 pool. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0286" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0286&rsqb;</number> For generating the 3&prime; fixed sequence we used oligo 3G7RC (Table 13) for the VEGF pool while 3G7RCD was used for the TGF&bgr;1 pools. The reason for using 3G7RCD was to avoid repetitions of the sequence 5&prime;CA at the end of the library with each SELEX round due to the RNaseH digestion leaving behind the CA sequence from the fixed sequence. To ensure better efficiency at each round, the starting library was modified by removing a significant portion of 5&prime; fixed sequence leaving behind the 5&prime;GGGAG transcription initiation site as follows. RNA transcripts from each of the starting pools were RNaseH digested at their 5&prime; ends, reverse transcribed using a primer complementary to the 3&prime; fixed sequence, and resulting cDNAs were ligated to the 5N7-Linker/5N7-Bridge set of oligos (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference>) as described above. This ligation (even though inefficient) generates molecules that have their 5&prime; fixed sequence replaced with the T7 promoter-5&prime;GGGAG sequence fused to the RNaseH digestion site. These new templates generate RNA containing just 5&prime;GGGAG as fixed sequence. These RNA molecules do not require RNaseH digestion at the 5&prime; end prior to selection and the 5&prime; primer binding sequence can be introduced (following selection, 3&prime; ligation and reverse transcription) using the 5G7RC-Linker/5&prime;N7 oligonucleotide set (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference>) which showed better ligation efficiencies compared to the 5N7-Linker/5N7-Bridge set. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</cross-reference> shows that as expected, PCR products of the 5&prime; truncated VEGF pools are shorter than the starting round 12 pool. In addition, the 5&prime; truncated starting pool retain some binding to VEGF compared to random RNA (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0287" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0287&rsqb;</number> At each round, affinity selections were done as described in Example 3. The conditions of affinity selections are summarized in Tables 6C and 6D. The RNA used at each round was generated by RNaseH digestion at the 3&prime; fixed sequence as described in Example 3. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0288" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0288&rsqb;</number> As seen in Tables 6C and 6D improving signal to noise ratios and an increase of the amount of RNA binding to the target was observed suggesting the selection process was successful. The starting 5&prime; truncated starting VEGF pool (designated T1), VEGF round 1 (designated T2), VEGF round 2 (designated T3), TGF&bgr;1-30N round 2, and TGF&bgr;2-40N round 2 pools were cloned and sequenced. The pools from these rounds were chosen for cloning and sequencing based on their binding properties. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0290" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0290&rsqb;</number> With the Truncation SELEX by Hybridization protocol it was easy to determine the effect of the selection process on the ligand frequency with respect to the effect of the fixed sequences on their binding activity. This was feasible since the cloned ligands contained both fixed sequences. With the Truncation SELEX by Ligation protocol as it was applied here, this was not feasible because the starting pool was truncated at the 5&prime; end removing the bulk of the 5&prime; fixed sequence. To determine the effect of the ligation protocol on the phenotype frequency of selected VEGF ligands, the starting 5&prime; truncated pool as well as the pools from round 1 and round 2 were cloned and sequenced. 43, 22, and 21 ligands were sequenced from the starting 5&prime; truncated, round 1 and round 2 VEGF pools, respectively. With the TGF&bgr;1 experiment, the ability to identify truncatable molecules was of interest and not in the comparison of phenotype frequencies. Therefore, only the final pools, namely round 2 from both the 30N and 40N experiment were sequenced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0291" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0291&rsqb;</number> The obtained sequences, their alignment, suggested family classification, and binding properties are summarized in Tables 14-18. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0292" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0292&rsqb;</number> The starting 5&prime; truncated VEGF pools contained ligands that could be assigned into the three families identified previously (Ruckman et al. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273:20556-67) and into a fourth family and a group of orphan sequences pyrimidine rich at their 3&prime; ends. The conserved sequence found at the 5&prime; end of members of family 4 is identical to the sequence of the 3&prime; fixed sequence and most likely this family might represent an artifact of the ligation reactions. As with the unmodified VT30 pool, members of family 2 are rare with only one example found. The majority of sequences in this starting pool contain the 3&prime; fixed sequence 5&prime;CA probably a remnant of the 3&prime; terminal sequence removed during the process of construction of this pool. In both of the selected VEGF pools, the frequency of the first three families is increased compared to the starting pool especially for family 2 while the frequency of the orphan sequences was decreased. The selected pools also contained versions of ligand VT30.3 with additional sequences at both ends. Ligand VT30.3 was found in high frequency in the first SELEX experiment (Ruckman et al. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273:20556-67). The majority of ligands from the round 2 pool contain multiple copies of the sequence 5&prime;CA at their 3&prime; ends, presumably a remnant of the RNaseH digested 3&prime; fixed sequence, which was added with each ligation step and left behind after each RNaseH digestion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0293" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0293&rsqb;</number> Sequences from the Rd2-30N TGF&bgr;1 truncation by ligation SELEX pool can be assigned into three groups, namely 2 families and a group of orphans. The orphan group contains ligands that have been identified as nitrocellulose binding molecules in previous experiments described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/046,247, filed Mar. 23, 1998. The remaining two families contain several highly homologous members that could be clonal derivatives of one or a few unique sequences by PCR mutations. Family 2 contains ligands that were identified at very low frequency in the first TGF&bgr;1 SELEX experiment described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/046,247, filed Mar. 23, 1998. Namely, there is a group of sequences (20, 27, 19, 12, 34, and 3) that share a large block of common sequence in the majority of the molecule differing only by two bases (5&prime;CA) at their 3&prime; end and 1-8 bases at their 5&prime; end possibly due to ligation artifacts. Their common sequence is identical to the sequence of ligand 30-32 isolated in our first SELEX experiment with TGF&bgr;1 described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/046,247, filed Mar.23, 1998. Ligands from family one are highly conserved (and could be derivatives of a single sequence found in the starting random RNA pool) and were not isolated before. Since we use DNA oligo without the CA sequence at its 5&prime; end for ligation at the 3&prime; end of TGF&bgr;1 selected RNA, the isolated ligands from the Rd2-30N TGF&bgr;1 truncation by Ligation SELEX pool do not contain the sequence 5&prime;CA at their 3&prime; ends. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0294" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0294&rsqb;</number> Sequences from the Rd2-40N TGF&bgr;1 truncation by ligation SELEX pool can be assigned into seven families. These families are rather small and they could be clonal derivatives of one or a few unique sequences by PCR mutations. The last family contains ligands with sequences characteristic of nitrocellulose binders. All the ligands from family 1 contain the 3&prime; fixed sequence of the N7 series at their 5&prime; end and the majority of them contain at their 3&prime; ends a large portion of the T7 promoter. Thus, these ligands must represent artifacts of the ligation reactions. Family two contains ligands of the same class as ligands from family 2 of the Rd2-30N TGF&bgr;1 truncation by ligation SELEX pool but the majority of them contain the 3&prime; fixed sequence at their 5&prime; ends. Therefore they could be contaminants from the 30N pool that were modified due to undesirable ligation side reactions. Family 2, however, contains three ligands that could be true isolates from the 40N pool. The other families contain ligands that were not identified in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/046,247, filed Mar. 23, 1998. Family four contains members that are longer than expected by ten bases. As with the ligands from the 30N pool, the ligands from the 40N pool do not contain the sequence 5&prime;CA at their 3&prime; end, but unlike the 30N ligands the 40N ligands have a somewhat heterogeneous 5&prime; initiator sequence. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0295" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0295&rsqb;</number> Binding Properties of Ligands from the Truncation SELEX by Ligation </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0296" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0296&rsqb;</number> The binding activity of several ligands from the Truncation SELEX by Ligation experiments was determined by nitrocellulose filter binding and data are summarized in Tables 14-18. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0297" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0297&rsqb;</number> Binding activities of ligands from the VEGF experiments were determined with or without the 3&prime; fixed sequence. Ligands from all pools included examples of both monophasic and biphasic binding. Example binding curves are as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</cross-reference>. Like the truncation SELEX by hybridization experiment, each ligand was scored and classified into five groups as follows: (1) ligands that lose significant affinity for VEGF upon removal of their 3&prime; fixed sequences; (2) molecules with affinities for VEGF somewhat affected (positively or negatively) upon removal of their 3&prime; fixed sequences; (3) molecules that gain significant affinity for VEGF upon removal of their 3&prime; fixed sequences; (4) molecules with affinities for VEGF not affected upon removal of their 3&prime; fixed sequences; and (5) non-binding ligands either with or without the 3&prime; fixed sequences. For quantitative comparison, the data were analyzed as above in % plateau vs Kd values (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</cross-reference>). For biphasic curves, values of the major affinity component were used. Because the members of the starting pool for this SELEX experiment were truncated at their 5&prime; ends, the phenotype of ligands as full-length molecules containing both the 5&prime; and 3&prime; fixed sequences could not be compared. In order to define the affinity quadrants, the affinity points of full-length ligands from the Rd12 VT30 pool were used. Therefore, based on the affinity values of the Rd12 VT30 ligands, the graphs are divided into four quadrants (I, II, III, and IV) where quadrant I represents low Kds and high plateaus (optimum affinities). The remaining three quadrants represent sub-optimal affinities with quadrant IV being the worst. In all pools from this truncation SELEX by ligation experiment, the ligands containing the 3&prime; fixed sequence occupied suboptimal affinity quadrants (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</cross-reference>). Upon removal of the 3&prime; fixed sequence, the majority of the affinity points of the selected pools (but not of the 5&prime; truncated starting pool) occupied the optimum affinity quadrant. Comparison of the frequencies of ligands in each quadrant is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</cross-reference>. These data clearly show that truncation SELEX by ligation, within one round, shifted the population frequencies so truncatable ligands become more abundant. Of interest is the observation that in the presence of the 3&prime; fixed sequence the majority of ligands tested showed worse affinities suggesting that the 3&prime; fixed sequence probably influences the folding of these ligands towards incorrect conformations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0298" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0298&rsqb;</number> As with the truncation SELEX by hybridization experiment, the binding of the ligands from the TGF&bgr;1 truncation by ligation SELEX was determined only after RNaseH digestions to remove the 3&prime; fixed sequence and the data are summarized in Tables 17 and 18. The majority of selected ligands tested bound the target with high affinity in the absence of the 3&prime; fixed sequence. Sample binding curves are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</cross-reference>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0299" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0299&rsqb;</number> Truncation SELEX with DNA Libraries </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0300" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0300&rsqb;</number> The truncation SELEX process described herein is designed for use with RNA (native or modified) libraries. With slight modification, this approach can be applied to ssDNA libraries. These modifications could be applied to templates engineered to include restriction enzyme recognition sites at the junction of the random region with the 5&prime; and 3&prime; fixed sequences (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 32 and 41</cross-reference>). The ssDNA library lacking the 5&prime; and 3&prime; fixed sequences can be generated in at least three ways (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference>). First, sense strands can be purified using a biotinylated 3&prime; primer and streptavidin induced gel shift on denaturing gels (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference>, left branch) (Pagratis (1996) Nucleic Acids Research 24:3645-6). Purified sense strands can then be annealed to single stranded oligos complementary to the 5&prime; and 3&prime; fixed sequences containing the restriction sites (sequences could be as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</cross-reference>. Annealed oligonucleotides are then digested with the appropriate restriction endonuclease and the fragment containing the random region is purified by denaturing gel electrophoresis. Second, double stranded PCR templates can be digested with appropriate restriction endonuclease to remove the 5&prime; and 3&prime; fixed sequences (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference>, middle branch). In this case, restriction sites are chosen to generate a 3&prime; recessive and a 5&prime; recessive end at the 5&prime; and 3&prime; fixed sequences, respectively. Following digestion the 3&prime;recessive end is filled-in with the Klenow fragment of <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>DNA polymerase-I and biotin-dUTP. The non-biotinylated sense strand is then purified by streptavidin induced gel shift on denaturing gels (Pagratis (1996) Nucleic Acids Research 24:3645-6). Third, in a variation of the second method, the double stranded PCR templates can be digested with appropriate restriction endonuclease to remove first the 5&prime; fixed sequence. In this case restriction sites that generate a 3&prime; recessive end can be used at the 3&prime; fixed sequence. Following digestion at the 5&prime; fixed sequence, the products are biotinylated as above with the Klenow fragment of <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>DNA polymerase-I and biotin-dUTP. Following biotinylation, the 3&prime; fixed sequence is digested away using the appropriate restriction enzyme and the nonbiotinylated sense strand is purified as above (Pagratis (1996) Nucleic Acids Research 24:3645-6). Following target partition, selected ssDNA molecules can be amplified by either following the hybrid selection approach or the ligation approach. For the hybrid selection approach, a portion of the selected pool from the previous round is amplified using a biotinylated 5&prime; primer and the nonbiotinylated antisense strands are purified as above (Pagratis (1996) Nucleic Acids Research 24:3645-6). The selected RNA is then biotinylated as in the case of RNA (for example with terminal transferase and Biotin-dUTP) and hybridized in excess of purified full length antisense strand in the presence of nonspecific competitor (as described above with the RNA truncation SELEX by hybridization method). Hybridized molecules are then captured as before (for example streptavidin beads) and PCR amplified to generate the pools for the next round. For the ligation approach, the selected ssDNA is ligated to primers in the presence of appropriate bridging oligonucleotides or alternative using appropriately designed stem-loop structures (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0301" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0301&rsqb;</number> The data presented in Examples 3-11 clearly demonstrate the feasibility of isolating nucleic acid ligands that utilize just the random region for high affinity binding to their target. To isolate such nucleic acid ligands it is not necessary to start with unselected pools. When starting with evolved pools, selection could happen relatively fast within 1-2 rounds. Two different approaches were described, one based on hybrid selection of complementary full-length molecules and the other based on enzymatic generation of primer binding sites to allow PCR amplification. Both methods gave similar results. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</cross-reference> shows the progress of both selection processes showing almost superimposible results. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</cross-reference> compares the binding phenotype of individual ligands with or without their fixed sequences. Within one round of selection the two processes described here dramatically increase the frequency of ligands that bind the same or better to the target if their fixed sequences are removed. The shift in frequencies with the ligation method is more pronounced suggesting a more efficient selection. Although the ligation method gave more striking results, it was found that this method yielded artifact ligands that resulted from the shuffling of fixed sequences by the enzymatic steps used. Such sequence rearrangements were not found with the hybrid selection method. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0303" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0303&rsqb;</number> The experimental demonstration of the method shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is described in this example. Body labeled KGF ligands 56F, 53F, 38F, 26F, 15F and 14F were cleaved by alkaline hydrolysis, bound to KGF and the bound fragments were partitioned by nitrocellulose filtration and analyzed on a sequencing gel (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>). The potential minimal fragments are marked on the gel suggesting that ligands 53F, 38F, 26, 15F, and 14F show minimal possible sizes in the 45 base range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0304" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0304&rsqb;</number> Minimum size fragments can also be identified in pools of molecules containing truncatable ligands to reasonable frequencies. As shown the reconstruction experiment in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, alkaline hydrolysis followed by affinity selection, allows the identification of the minimum fragment as predicted by conventional truncation experiments with approximate size of 59 bases. Mixing of K14 ligand with random RNA at rations of p to 1:100, random fragmentation and affinity selection allows the identification of the expected K14 minimum fragment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0305" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0305&rsqb;</number> Alkaline hydrolysis is routinely used to create the random cleavage ladders, but it creates homogeneous ladders only with RNA. Modified RNA at the 2&prime; position of pyrimidines gives sequence specific incomplete ladders while DNA is not susceptible to alkaline hydrolysis. We tested a group of nucleases for their ability to generate random complete ladders with 2&prime;F-pyrimidine modified RNA. Enzymes tested were mung bean nuclease, nuclease S1, snake venom phosphodiesterase, nuclease S7, and nuclease P1. Only snake venom phosphodiesterase, nuclease S7, and nuclease P1 resulted in homogeneous laddering of the oligonucleotide used (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>). Since snake venom phosphodiesterase is an active 3&prime; to 5&prime; exonuclease with some endonuclease activity only the nuclease P1 and S7 can be used in minimum fragment determination experiments.
