<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Technical Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a vibration-damping thermoplastic resin composition and an article molded therefrom. More specifically, it relates to a thermoplastic resin composition in which the thermoplastic resin comprises a specific amorphous thermoplastic resin and a methyl methacrylate resin and which is excellent in vibration dampability as well as dimensional accuracy, rigidity and heat resistance and is low in weight; and an article molded therefrom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In recent years, along with an increase in the speeds of writing and reading information in office automation equipment, the demand for imparting the vibration dampability against the vibration source produced by a driving system to the components constituting the equipment has been growing together with the demand for improving the rigidity and heat resistance of each of the components, and it has also been demanded that the vibration dampability be imparted to a thermoplastic resin composition and an article molded therefrom. For example, for an optical disk such as CD-ROM, a so-called high-speed revolution of at least 30 times is on its way to becoming mainstream. In this case, a turntable which directly acts on the revolution of the disk, chassis for supporting these, and the like are demanded to have good vibration dampability. Similarly, for an optical printer, high-speed revolving polygon mirrors, optical boxes for supporting the mirrors, and the like are demanded to have good vibration dampability and, along with an increase in the printing speed, the demand for the good vibration dampability has also been increasing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> However, since a thermoplastic resin alone generally has extremely poor vibration dampability, there is the problem that it lacks vibration dampability against an increase in the speeds of the office automation equipment mentioned above. Rubber is an example of a material having high vibration dampability. However, since such a material lacks rigidity, an inorganic filler or the like must be filled densely in the material. As a result, the material has a high specific gravity, whereby it cannot satisfy the demand. The material must be light in weight for high-speed revolution, and the lighter the weight is, the higher the natural frequency becomes. Further, to adapt to a high-temperature environment caused by the environment under which the equipment is used and/or by the heat generated by the internal components of the equipment, heat resistance is also an important factor. Such highly demanded properties can never be achieved when rubber is used as the thermoplastic resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, in addition to rubber, a liquid crystal polymer such as a wholly aromatic polyester is known as a resin having high vibration dampability. However, since the resin is a crystalline resin which exhibits extremely strong anisotropy, an article molded therefrom is liable to warp, so that it cannot be sufficiently applied to the fields in which high dimensional accuracy is desired. Further, as to the dimensional accuracy, factors associated with time are also important, and low water absorption is also desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 9-40840 proposes a resin composition with high rigidity and excellent vibration dampability which is obtained by adding a vibration-damping elastomer and a specific whisker into a thermoplastic resin. The resin composition, however, cannot satisfy all the above currently demanded properties such as vibration dampability, low specific gravity and small warpage of a molded article at high levels. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is the object of the present invention to provide a thermoplastic resin composition which has not only good vibration dampability but also excellent dimensional accuracy, rigidity and heat resistance and is light in weight; and an article molded therefrom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The present inventors have made intense studies to attain the object. As a result, it has been found that the above object can be attained by a thermoplastic resin composition obtained by mixing an amorphous thermoplastic resin having a specific loss tangent (tan &dgr;) value and a deflection temperature under load of not lower than a given temperature and a methyl methacrylate resin in a specific ratio. The present invention has been completed by this finding. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> That is, according to the present invention, there is provided a vibration-damping thermoplastic resin composition comprising (a) 50 to 90 wt % of an amorphous thermoplastic resin (component A) having a loss tangent (tan &dgr;) value measured at 40&deg; C. and 18 Hz in accordance with JIS K7198 of 0.01 to 0.04 and a deflection temperature under load measured under a load of 1.82 MPa in accordance with ASTM D648 of not lower than 120&deg; C. and (b) 50 to 10 wt % of a methyl methacrylate resin (component B), wherein an article molded from this resin composition has the following physical properties (1) to (4), i.e., (1) a loss factor of 0.04 to 0.08, (2) a water absorption measured when immersed in water at 23&deg; C. for 24 hours in accordance with ASTM D570 of not higher than 0.30 wt %, (3) a specific gravity measured in accordance with JIS K7112 of 1.05 to 1.3, and (4) a deflection temperature under load measured under a load of 1.82 MPa in accordance with ASTM D648 of 110 to 170&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The thermoplastic resin composition of the present invention and an article molded therefrom will be described in more detail hereinafter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The thermoplastic resin used as the component A of the present invention is an amorphous resin having a loss tangent (tan &dgr;) value measured at 40&deg; C. and 18 Hz in accordance with JIS K7198 of 0.01 to 0.04. The tan &dgr; is preferably 0.012 to 0.035. When it is smaller than 0.01, the vibration dampability of the vibration-damping thermoplastic resin composition of the present invention is not satisfactory, while when it is larger than 0.04, it is not preferable from the viewpoint of dimensional accuracy. Further, the thermoplastic resin used as the component A has a deflection temperature under load measured under a load of 1.82 MPa in accordance with ASTM D648 of not lower than 120&deg; C., preferably not lower than 122&deg; C. A representative resin which satisfies these conditions is selected from an aromatic polycarbonate resin, a polysulfone resin, an amorphous polyarylate resin and a cyclic polyolefin resin (such as a polynorbornene resin) which satisfy the conditions. Of these, the aromatic polycarbonate resin or the cyclic polyolefin resin is preferable, and the aromatic polycarbonate resin is particularly preferable. These may be used alone or in admixture of two or more, and even when resins are of the same type, they may be used alone or in admixture of two or more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> According to the studies of the present inventors, it has been found that an aromatic polycarbonate resin obtained as the component A by using a bisphenol having the following specific structure is a particularly suitable resin which has a loss tangent (tan &dgr;) value and a deflection temperature under load that satisfy the above suitable ranges and which can constitute a resin composition having excellent dimensional accuracy, heat resistance and rigidity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> That is, the aromatic polycarbonate resin which is suitable as the component A is exemplified by a polycarbonate resin containing 1,1-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane represented by the following structural formula (1) (to be sometimes abbreviated as &ldquo;bisphenol TMC&rdquo; hereinafter) in a proportion of at least 20 mol % based on 100 mol % of the total of all aromatic dihydroxy components.

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> That is, the aromatic polycarbonate resin which is preferable as the component A contains the above bisphenol TMC in a proportion of at least 20 mol %, preferably 30 to 80 mol %, based on 100 mol % of the total of all aromatic dihydroxy components. When the proportion of the bisphenol TMC is higher than or equal to 20 mol %, the thermoplastic resin composition has a high loss tangent (tan &dgr;) value, excellent vibration dampability and low water absorption, and better dimensional stability can be attained accordingly. On the other hand, when the proportion of the bisphenol TMC exceeds 80 mol %, the water absorption is liable to become high. Therefore, when the proportion of the bisphenol TMC is as high as described above, it is desirable to modify terminals by a specific terminal-group modifier as described hereinafter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The above aromatic polycarbonate resin preferably contains the above bisphenol TMC in a given proportion as an aromatic dihydroxy component. Means employed for obtaining desired properties, particularly a water absorption of not higher than 0.2 wt %, preferably not higher than 0.15 wt %, are roughly classified into two means, one of which comprises mixing a specific dihydroxy component with the above bisphenol TMC to produce a copolycarbonate resin and the other of which comprises introducing a terminal modifier having a specific structure into terminal groups. These two means may be used solely or in combination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> According to the studies of the present inventors, it has been found that the copolycarbonate resin obtained by mixing the specific dihydroxy component with the above bisphenol TMC is particularly suitable as the component A of the vibration-damping thermoplastic resin composition. That is, as the component A of the present invention, a copolycarbonate resin is particularly preferable which contains (a) bisphenol TMC (component a) and (b) at least one aromatic dihydroxy component (component b) selected from 4,4&prime;-(m-phenylenediisopropylidene)diphenol (to be sometimes abbreviated as &ldquo;bisphenol M&rdquo; hereinafter) represented by the following structural formula &lsqb;2&rsqb; and 2,2-bis(3-methyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propane (to be sometimes abbreviated as &ldquo;bisphenol C&rdquo; hereinafter) represented by the following structural formula &lsqb;3&rsqb; in a proportion of at least 80 mol % out of 100 mol % of the total of all aromatic dihydroxy components and which contains the component a and the component b in a molar ratio of 20:80 to 80:20.

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> One preferable embodiment of the above copolycarbonate resin is a copolycarbonate resin containing bisphenol TMC as the component a and bisphenol M as the component b in a molar ratio of 30:70 to 80:20, particularly preferably 40:60 to 70:30. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Another preferable embodiment of the above copolycarbonate resin is a copolycarbonate resin containing bisphenol TMC as the component a and bisphenol C as the component b in a molar ratio of 30:70 to 80:20, particularly preferably 40:60 to 70:30. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In these preferable embodiments, it is advantageous that the total of the component a and the component b is at least 80 mol %, preferably at least 90 mol %, out of 100 mol % of the total of all aromatic dihydroxy components. Typically, a copolycarbonate resin which substantially comprises the component a and the component b is desirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, although it is desirable that the aromatic polycarbonate resin which is preferably used as the component A in the present invention contain the above components a and b in a proportion of at least 80 mol %, preferably at least 90 mol %, out of 100 mol % of the total of all aromatic dihydroxy components, it may also contain other dihydroxy component (component c) in a proportion of not higher than 20 mol %, preferably not higher than 10 mol %, out of 100 mol % of the total of all aromatic dihydroxy components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The component c may be any component other than the above components a and b which is commonly used as a dihydroxy component of an aromatic polycarbonate. Illustrative examples of the component usable as the component c include hydroquinone, resorcinol, 4,4&prime;-biphenol, 1,1-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethane, 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane, 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butane, 1,1-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-phenylethane, 1,1-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)cyclohexane, 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentane, 4,4&prime;-(p-phenylenediisopropylidene)diphenol, 9,9-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)fluorene, and 1,1-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4-isopropylcyclohexane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Further, the aromatic polycarbonate resin may contain branching components in the polymer by further containing a polyfunctional aromatic compound having at least three functionalities or as a result of isomerization at the time of polymerization. Illustrative examples of the polyfunctional aromatic compound having at least three functionalities include fluoroglucine; fluoroglucide; trisphenols such as 4,6-dimethyl-2,4,6-tris(4-hydroxydiphenyl)heptene-2,2,4,6-trimethyl-2,4,6-tris(4-hydroxyphenyl)heptane, 1,3,5-tris(4-hydroxyphenyl)benzene, 1,1,1-tris(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethane, 1,1,1-tris(3,5-dimethyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)ethane, 2,6-bis(2-hydroxy-5-methylbenzyl)-4-methylphenol and 4-&lcub;4-&lsqb;1,1-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl&rsqb;benzene&rcub;-&agr;,&agr;-dimethylbenzylphenol; tetra(4-hydroxyphenyl)methane; bis(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)ketone; 1,4-bis(4,4-dihydroxytriphenylmethyl)benzene; and trimellitic acid, pyromellitic acid, benzophenonetetracarboxylic acid, and acid chlorides thereof. Of these, 1,1,1-tris(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethane and 1,1,1-tris(3,5-dimethyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)ethane are preferable, and 1,1,1-tris(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethane is particularly preferable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The aromatic polycarbonate resin used as the component A of the present invention is produced by a commonly used reaction means known per se for producing an aromatic polycarbonate resin, for example, a method in which the aromatic dihydroxy components are caused to react with a carbonate precursor such as phosgene or carbonic diester. Next, a brief description will be given to a basic means for carrying out such a production method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The reaction by a solution method is generally a reaction between a dihydric phenol and phosgene and is carried out in the presence of an acid binder and an organic solvent. As the acid binder, an alkali metal hydroxide such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide or an amine compound such as pyridine is used. As the organic solvent, a halogenated hydrocarbon such as methylene chloride or chlorobenzene is used. Further, to accelerate the reaction, catalysts such as tertiary amines, quaternary ammonium compounds and quaternary phosphonium compounds, e.g., triethylamine, tetra-n-butylammonium bromide and tetra-n-butylphosphonium bromide can be used. In that case, it is preferable that the reaction temperature be generally 0 to 40&deg; C., the reaction time be 10 minutes to 5 hours and the pH during the reaction be maintained at 9 or higher. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Further, in the polymerization reaction, a terminator is generally used. As the terminator, a monofunctional phenol can be used. The monofunctional phenol is generally used as a terminator for controlling a molecular weight, and since the obtained polycarbonate resin has its terminals terminated by monofunctional phenol-based groups, it has excellent thermal stability as compared with the one whose terminals are not terminated by the monofunctional phenol-based groups. The monofunctional phenol is generally a phenol or a lower alkyl-substituted phenol and can be exemplified by the monofunctional phenol represented by the following general formula &lsqb;4&rsqb;.

<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Comparing the cases in Tables 1 to 3 (Comparative Examples 1 and 2) where the aromatic polycarbonate resin is solely used, the aromatic polycarbonate resin comprising a bisphenol TMC/bisphenol M copolymer which is used as the component A of the present invention in the examples has higher vibration dampability, lower specific gravity, lower water absorption and higher flexural modulus than the aromatic polycarbonate resin comprising bisphenol A alone. As is understood from this, when Example 1 and Comparative Example 7 are compared with each other, it is understood that by using the aromatic polycarbonate comprising a bisphenol TMC/bisphenol M copolymer and adding the methyl methacrylate resin (component B) and the platy filler (component C), the loss tangent (tan &dgr;) and the loss factor are increased. Further, it is also understood that the vibration dampability further improves as the amounts of the components B and C increase. Further, it is understood that a molded article having high vibration dampability can also be obtained by using a combination of the aromatic polycarbonate resin and a cyclic polyolefin or a polyarylate as the component A as in Examples 7 and 8. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> In addition, it is also understood from Examples 13 to 15 that a molded article having excellent vibration dampability can be obtained when a cyclic polyolefin resin is used as the component A. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EFFECT OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> An article molded from the vibration-damping thermoplastic resin composition of the present invention is excellent in vibration dampability as well as dimensional accuracy, rigidity and heat resistance, light in weight and useful in a variety of fields as of electronic, electric and information equipment, automobiles, machine parts and the like. Particularly, it is used as a turntable for an optical disk and precision instrument parts including the turntable in addition to high-speed revolving parts requiring the above properties at high levels (such as turntables for a variety of optical disks, polygon mirrors in an optical printer and supporting boxes therefor).
