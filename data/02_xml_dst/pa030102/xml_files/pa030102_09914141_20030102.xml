<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A polyalkylene terephthalate-series resin (e.g., polyethylene terephthalate-series resin, polybutylene terephthalate-series resin) is improved in flame retardancy by using a flame retardant containing a phosphazene compound and a phenolic resin. The phosphazene compound is a compound shown by the following formulae (1) and/ or (2), and/or a compound being the above compound crosslinked with a phenylene group or a crosslinking group shown by the following formula (3<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). The proportion of the phosphazene compound to the phenolic resin is the former/the latter&equals;5/95 to 95/5 (weight ratio). By means of the above flame retardant, a polyalkylene terephthalate-series resin can be highly improved in flame retardancy without deteriorating the properties. Further, by adding the other flame retardant (e.g., a nitrogen-containing flame retardant, a phosphate-series flame retardant), and a carbonizable resin, the flame retardancy can be enhanced.

<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a flame-retardant resin composition comprising a polyalkylene terephthalate-series resin. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A polyalkylene terephthalate-series resin such as a polybutylene terephthalate has excellent mechanical and electrical properties, weather resistance, water resistance, and resistance to chemicals and solvents. Therefore fore, the resin is used as an engineering plastic in a variety of applications such as electric or electronic device parts, mechanical device parts and automotive parts. While, the resin is required to be flame-retardant from viewpoint of safety as the field of their uses expands. In general, there is known a method for rendering the resin flame-retardant by adding a flame retardant composed of a halogen-containing compound and/or an antimony-containing compound to the resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 168297/1998 (JP-10-168297A) discloses a flame-retardant resin composition comprising a thermoplastic polyester resin, a polycarbonate-series resin, an organic phosphorus-series flame retardant which is a phosphate-series flame retardant. Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 195283/1998 (JP-10-195283A) discloses a polyester resin composition which is rendered flame-retardant by combining a phosphate having the specific structure, a novolak-type phenol resin and the specific oxide of a metal such as iron, cobalt, nickel or copper in suitable amounts. However, the phosphate-series flame retardant does not contain a harmful halogen, but a large amount of the flame retardant is required because of their inferior flame retardancy to the halogen-containing flame retardant. Thus, a bleed out and deterioration of the mechanical properties of the resin are caused and the mechanical properties can not be improved accompanied with the flame retardancy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Moreover, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 181268/1999 (JP-11-181268A) discloses that addition of 1.5 to 15 parts by weight of a phosphazene compound and 0.5 to 30 parts by weight of talc and/or mica to 100 parts by weight of a resin mixture containing an aromatic polycarbonate-series resin and a thermoplastic polyester-series resin in the proportion of 90/10 to 50/50 (weight ratio) renders the resin mixture flame-retardant. However, the resin composition composed of the aromatic polycarbonate has a problem of resistance to solvents, and further, the moldability is lowered because of the inferior melt-flowability upon molding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 181429/1999 (JP-11-181429) discloses that either a thermoplastic resin (e.g., polyethylene terephthalate, polybutylene terephthalate, polycarbonate) or a thermosetting resin (e.g., phenol resin) is rendered flame-retardant with use of the specific phosphazene compound (e.g., a cyclic phosphazene compound, a linear phosphazene compound, a crosslinked phosphazene compound obtained by crosslinking the cyclic and/or the linear phosphazene compound with the specific group) as a flame retardant. However, in case of rendering a polyethylene terephthalate or a polybutylene terephthalate flame-retardant, the phosphazene compound alone can not sufficiently impart the flame-retardancy to the resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is object of the present invention to provide a resin composition having a high flame-retardancy without deteriorating the properties of polyalkylene terephthalate-series resin. </paragraph>

R. Allcock, published by Academic Press, (1972), &ldquo;Inorganic Polymers&rdquo; by J. E. Mark, H. R. Allcock, R. West, published by Prentice-Hall International, Inc.,(1992). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> For example, a mixture of a compound of the formula (1) wherein the group OPh is substituted by a chlorine atom (Cl) and m is an integer of 3 to 25 (a cyclic dichlorophosphazene oligomer), and a compound of the formula (2) wherein the group OPh is substituted by a chlorine atom and n is an integer of 3 to 25 (a chain dichlorophosphazene oligomer) can be obtained by a reaction of phosphorus chloride (e.g., phosphorus trichloride, phosphorus pentachloride) and ammonium chloride, and if necessary a chlorine (in particular, in case of using phosphorus trichloride as the phosphorus chloride) in a chlorine-series solvent (e.g., chlorobenzene, tetrachloroethane). The cyclic and linear phenoxyphosphazene compounds represented by the formulae (1) and (2) can be obtained by substituting a chlorine atom of the dichlorophosphazene oligomer mixture by phenol with use of an alkali metal phenolate (e.g., sodium phenolate). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The reaction temperature in a reaction of phosphorus chloride and ammonium chloride is, for example, about 120 to 130&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> If necessary, the mixture of the dichlorophosphazene oligomer may be subjected to purification (e.g., distillation, recrystallization) or polymerization (ring-opening-polymerization of a cyclic dichlorophosphazene oligomer). By purifying the mixture of the dichlorophosphazene oligomer, a single or sole compound of the cyclic dichlorophosphazene (e.g., hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene, octachlorocyclotetra-phosphazene, decachlorocyclopentaphosphazene) can be obtained. Therefore, by substituting the single compound with a phenol, the cyclic phenoxyphosphazene compound such as hexaphenoxycyclotriphosphazene, octaphenoxycyclotetraphosphazene, and decaphenoxycyclopentaphosphazene can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> While, a cyclic dichlorophosphazene oligomer is ring-opening-polymerized to obtain a compound of the formula (2) wherein the group OPh is substituted with a chlorine atom and n is an integer of 3 to 10,000. Therefore, by substituting the compound with a phenol, the linear phenoxyphosphazene compound shown by the formula (2) can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The ring-opening-polymerization of the cyclic dichlorophosphazene oligomer can be carried out, for example, by heating to 220 to 250&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The crosslinked phenoxyphosphazene compound can be produced by partial-substituting (crosslinking) a chlorine atom with an alkali metal salt of an aromatic dihydroxy compound in lieu of by all-substituting the chlorine atom of the dichlorophosphazene oligomer with an alkali metal salt of phenol in the production process of the cyclic phosphazene compound (1) or the linear phosphazene compound (2). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The dichlorophosphazene oligomer is not particularly limited, and may be used as a mixture of the cyclic dichlorophosphazene oligomer and the linear dichlorophosphazene oligomer or each may be used singly. The reaction order is also not particularly limited. For example, an alkali metal salt of phenol and an alkali metal salt of an aromatic dihydroxy compound may be mixed and subjected to a reaction, or after a reaction with an alkali metal salt of phenol, an alkali metal salt of an aromatic dihydroxy compound may be reacted. Moreover, the reaction may be carried out in its reverse order. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> More preferably, a partial-substituted compound in which one part of chlorine atoms of the dichlorophosphazene compound is substituted with a phenol and one part thereof is substituted with an aromatic dihydroxy compound, and one part thereof is retained as chlorine atom, is obtained by reacting the dichlorophosphazene compound (e.g., cyclic dichlorophosphazene oligomer, linear dichlorophosphazene oligomer), an alkali metal salt of a phenol and an alkali metal salt of an aromatic dihydroxy compound (the first stage reaction). Then, the partial-substituted compound is reacted with an alkali metal salt of phenol (the second stage reaction) so that the crosslinked phenoxyphosphazene compound can be obtained. Thus the resulting crosslinked phenoxyphosphazene compound does not substantially contain a free hydroxyl group since all of hydroxyl groups of the aromatic dihydroxy compound are reacted with dichlorophosphazene compounds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> As the aromatic dihydroxy compound, use can be made of a compound having one or not less than two benzene rings in its molecule and two hydroxyl groups, more concretely, a compound having the above crosslinking group (o-phenylene group, m-phenylene group, p-phenylene group, a group shown by the formula (3a)). The preferred aromatic dihydroxy compound includes resorcinol, hydroquinone, catechol, 4,4&prime;-isopropylidenediphenol (bisphenol-A), 4,4&prime;-sulfonyldiphenol (bisphenol-S), 4,4&prime;-thiodiphenol, 4,4&prime;-oxydiphenol. 4,4&prime;-diphenol and the like.

<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In the first stage reaction, the total amount of an alkali metal salts of phenol and an aromatic dihydroxy compound is usually about 0.05 to 0.9 equivalent, and preferably about 0.1 to 0.8 equivalent based on the chlorine content of the dichlorophosphazene oligomer. When the amount of the alkali metal salt is less than 0.05 equivalent, the degree of crosslinking is insufficient. While, when the amount of the alkali metal salt is more than 0.9 equivalent, a free hydroxyl group (a hydroxyl group at one side of the dihydroxy compound) is introduced into the crosslinked phenoxyphosphazene compound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The ratio of the alkali metal salt of the aromatic dihydroxy compound to that of phenol is not particularly limited, can be suitably selected within a wide range and is usually the former/the latter&equals;about 1/2000 to 1/4 (molar ratio). When the ratio is remarkably less than 1/2000, the degree of crosslinking is insufficient. While, when the ratio is dramatically more than 1/4, the crosslink proceeds too much, so that the solubility and meltability of the crosslinked phenoxyphosphazene compound are deteriorated and the dispersability in a resin is inadequate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The first and second stage reactions may be carried out in a solvent (an aromatic hydrocarbon such as benzene, toluene, xylene, a halogenated aromatic hydrocarbon such as chlorobenzene). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The condensation reaction of the phenol and the aldehyde may be carried out in the presence of an acid catalyst such as an inorganic acid (e.g., hydrocholoric acid, sulfuric acid) and an organic acid (e.g., p-toluenesulfonic acid, oxalic acid) and may be carried out in the absence of a catalyst. The ratio of phenol to aldehyde is the former/the latter&equals;about 1/0.6 to 1/1 (molar ratio). </paragraph>

A phenol-novolak resin containing a free monomer component and a dimer component in small amounts &lsqb;e.g., a resin in which the total amount of a free monomer component and dimer components is, relative to a whole resin, not more than 20% by weight (e.g., about 0 to 20% by weight), preferably not more than 10% by weight (e.g., about 0 to 10% by weight), more preferably 5% by weight (e g., about 0 to 5% by weight)&rsqb; is preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The aralkyl resin includes a phenol-aralkyl resin obtained by a reaction of the phenol exemplified in item of the novolak resin with an aralkyl compound (a reactive compound having a xylylene unit, for example, a xylylene glycol or a derivative thereof such as p-xylylene glycol, and &agr;,&agr;&prime;-dimethoxy-p-xylene; &agr;,&agr;&prime;-dihalo-p-xylene such as &agr;,&agr;&prime;-dichloro-p-xylene). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The phenolic resin can be used singly or in combination. The preferred phenolic resin is a phenol-novolak resin, a phenol-aralkyl resin, a homo- or copolymer of a vinyl phenol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, a part or all of the phenolic hydroxyl groups of the phenolic resin may be optionally modified with boric acid, borate, phosphoric acid, phosphate or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The number average molecular weight of the phenolic resin is not particularly limited and can be selected within the range of about 300 to 5&times;10<highlight><superscript>4</superscript></highlight>, preferably about 300 to 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>4</superscript></highlight>, and more preferably about 300 to 8,000. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The ratio of the phenolic resin used in the flame retardants is, for example, about 1 to 40 parts by weight, preferably about 1 to 30 parts by weight, more preferably about 3 to 25 parts by weight (in particular, about 5 to 20 parts by weight) relative to 100 parts by weight of polyalkylene terephthalate-series resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the ratio of the phosphazene compound to the phenolic resin in the flame retardant is, for example, the former/the latter&equals;about 5/95 to 95/5 (weight ratio), preferably about 20/80 to 80/20 (weight ratio), more preferably about 30/70 to 70/30 (weight ratio). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Since the flame retardant of the present invention has a phenolic resin, the flame-retardancy can be imparted to the polyalkylene terephthalate-series resin with inhibiting the decline in a molecular weight and a mechanical property (e.g., strength, impact resistance) of the polyalkylene terephthalate-series resin. In particular, the phosphazene compound is combined with the phenolic resin so that the polyalkylene terephthalate-series resin is provided with higher flame-retardant compared to the case of using the phosphazene compound singly. Moreover, since the flame retardant does not contain a halogen, there is no possibility that a hydrogen halide which is poisonous gas generates upon decomposition and burning, and that corrosion of a mould and deterioration of a resin occur upon molding the resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The proportion of the flame retardant in the resin composition is not particularly limited as far as the property of the polyalkylene terephthalate-series resin is not deteriorated and is about 1 to 100 parts by weight, preferably about 5 to 90 parts by weight (e.g., about 5 to 80 parts by weight), more preferably about 10 to 80 parts by weight (e.g., about 20 to 60 parts by weight) relative to 100 parts by weight of the polyalkylene terephthalate-series resin. When the amount of the flame retardant is less than 1 part by weight, it is difficult that the flame-retardancy is imparted. When the amount of the flame retardant is more than 100 parts by weight, the mechanical strength and moldability of a molded article obtained from the resin composition are deteriorated. </paragraph>
