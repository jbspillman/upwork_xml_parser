<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to pluri-differentiated mesenchymal progenitor cells that are isolated from hematopoietic cells and macrophages in Dexter-type cultures and therapeutic uses for such cells. More specifically, the isolated mesenchymal progenitor cells can be used for diagnostic purposes, to enhance engraftment of human bone marrow or hematopoietic progenitor cells, or to treat graft versus host disease. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Bone marrow, the site of blood cell production and home to various leukemia and lymphoma cells, comprises a complex cellular population including hematopoietic progenitor or stem cells and the stromal cells that support them. Hematopoietic stem cells have the capacity for self-regeneration and for generating all blood cell lineages while stromal stem cells have the capacity for self-renewal and for producing the hematopoietic microenvironment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Two bone-marrow culture systems introduced in the mid-1970&apos;s have evolved as favored media for the in vitro analysis of mesengenesis and hematopoiesis. The Friedenstein culture system was introduced in 1976 as a media for the analysis and study of mesengenesis. (Friedenstein, et al, in Exp <highlight><italic>Hematol </italic></highlight>4,267-74 (1976). In order to obtain mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for expansion in the culture medium, it is necessary to first isolate rare pluripotant mesenchymal stem cells from other cells in the bone marrow. In the Friedenstein culture system, isolating the nonhematopoietic cells is achieved by utilizing their tendency to adhere to plastic. Once isolated, a monolayer of homogeneous, undifferentiated stromal cells is then grown in the culture medium, in the absence of hematopoietic cells. The stromal cells from this system have the potential to differentiate into discrete mesenchymal tissues, namely bone, cartilage, adipose tissue and muscle depending on specific growth supplements. These MSCs have been the target of extensive investigation including exploration of their potential clinical utility in repair or replacement of genetically damaged mesenchymal tissues. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In 1977, Dexter, et al. developed another bone marrow culture system for the study of hematopoiesis. (Dexter et al. <highlight><italic>J Cell Physiol </italic></highlight>91, 335-44 (1977). The Dexter culture does not require isolation of the mesenchymal cells before culturing, thus the monolayer of stromal cells is grown in the presence of hematopoietic cells. Greenberger later modified the Dexter system by the addition of hydrocortisone to the culture medium, making it more reproducible (Greenberger, <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>275, 752-4 (1978). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Based on the Dexter system&apos;s ability to support sustained growth and preservation of hematopoietic progenitor cells, it has become the standard in vitro model for the study of hematopoiesis. Although the Dexter-type stromal cells and the MSCs in Friedenstein-type cultures express similar cytokine/growth factor profiles, the Dexter cultures have been found to be more efficient at maintaining preservation of hematopoietic progenitor cells. Over the last 23 years, questions have remained as to whether the cells from the Dexter cultures retained the potential to differentiate, like the MSCs in the Friedenstein culture, or whether they have differentiated into another and discrete phenotype due to their interaction with the hematopoietic cells (Prockop, <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>v276 n5309, p71(4)(April 1997)). It has been widely believed that the stromal cells of the Dexter cultures are a heterogeneous mixture of adipocytes, osteoblasts, fibroblasts, muscle cells, and vascular endothelial cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The in vitro analysis and study of hematopoiesis in Friedenstein and Dexter culture systems has been of great importance in both veterinary and human medicine. A number of diseases and immune disorders, as well as malignancies, appear to be related to disruptions within the hematopoietic system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation is the preferred treatment for a variety of malignant and genetic diseases of the blood and blood-forming cells. The success rate of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation is, in large part, dependent on the ability to closely match the major histocompatibility complex of the donor cells with that of the recipient cells to minimize the antigenic differences between the donor and the recipient, thereby reducing the frequency of host-versus-graft responses and graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Unfortunately, only about 20% of all potential candidates for bone marrow transplantation have a suitable family member match. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Bone marrow transplantation can be offered to those patients who lack an appropriate sibling donor by using bone marrow from antigenically matched, genetically unrelated donors (identified through a national registry), or by using bone marrow from a genetically related sibling or parent whose transplantation antigens differ by one to three of six human leukocyte antigens from those of the patient. Unfortunately, the likelihood of fatal GvHD and/or graft rejection increases from 20% for matched sibling donors to 50% in the cases of matched, unrelated donors and un-matched donors from the patient&apos;s family. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The potential benefits of bone marrow transplantation have stimulated research on the cause and prevention of GvHD. The removal of T cells from the bone marrow obtained from matched unrelated or unmatched sibling donors results in a decreased incidence of graft versus host reactions, but an increased incidence of rejection of the allogeneic bone marrow graft by the patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Current therapy for GvHD is imperfect, and the disease can be disfiguring and/or lethal. Thus, risk of GvHD restricts the use of bone marrow transplantation to patients with otherwise fatal diseases, such as severe immunodeficiency disorders, severe aplastic anemia, and malignancies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The potential to enhance engraftment of bone marrow or stem cells from antigenically mismatched donors to patients without graft rejection or GvHD would greatly extend the availability of bone marrow transplantation to those patients without an antigenically matched sibling donor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Thus, it would be useful to develop methods of improving bone marrow transplantation by enhancing the engraftment of bone marrow or hematopoietic progenitor cells and/or decreasing the occurrence of graft rejection or GvHD in allogenic transplants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Studies of hematopoiesis and mesengenesis and the urgent need for improved methods of treatment in the field of bone marrow transplants have led to the isolation of MSCs from bone marrow stroma. These MSCs are the same pluri-potential cells that result from expansion in Friedenstein type cultures. Several patents describe the isolation and therapeutic uses of these MSCs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,486,359 to Caplan, et al. is directed to isolated human MSCs, and a method for their isolation, purification, and culturing. Caplan, et al. also describes methods for characterizing and using the purified mesenchymal stem cells for research, diagnostic, and therapeutic purposes. The invention in &apos;359 to Caplan, et al. describes pluri-potential cells that remain pluri-potential, even after cultural expansion. Caplan, et al. also teaches that it is necessary to first isolate the pluri-potent MSCs from other cells in the bone marrow and then, in some applications, uses culture medium to expand the population of the isolated MSCs. This patent fails to disclose the use of Dexter-type cultures, pluri-differentiated mesenchymal progenitor cells, or the isolation of cells from Dexter-type cultures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,733,542 to Haynesworth, et al., is directed to methods and preparations for enhancing bone marrow engraftment in an individual by administering culturally expanded MSC preparations and a bone marrow graft. U.S. Pat. 6,010,696 to Caplan, et al., is directed to methods and preparations for enhancing hematopoietic progenitor cell engraftment in an individual by administering culturally expanded MSC preparations and hematopoietic progenitor cells. The cells utilized in Haynesworth, et al. and &apos;696 to Caplan, et al. are the pluri-potential cells described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,486,359, above. Neither patent discloses the use of Dexter-type cultures, pluri-differentiated mesenchymal progenitor cells, or the isolation of cells from Dexter-type cultures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Mesenchymal stem cells that are isolated from bone marrow are further described by Prockop, in <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>v276 n5309, p71 (4)(1997) and Pittenger, et al. in <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>v284 i5411, p143 (1). These articles also describe pluri-potential but undifferentiated MSCs and fail to teach or disclose a pluri-differentiated mesenchymal cell or the isolation of mesenchymal cells from Dexter- type cultures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> While they may provide some benefit, the isolated MSCs in the prior art have not solved the problems associated with engraftment of hematopoietic progenitor cells or bone marrow engraftment. Consequently, there exists a need in the art for methods of improving engraftment of hematopoietic progenitor cells and engraftment of bone marrow in mammals in need of such treatment. There also exists a need in the art for treating and preventing the occurrence of GvHD in mammals that receive allogeneic bone marrow transplants. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Generally, the present invention provides isolated and purified mesenchymal progenitor cells that are pluri-differentiated. Also provided by the present invention is a therapeutic composition including an effective amount of isolated and purified pluri-differentiated mesenchymal progenitor cells and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The present invention is premised upon the discovery that Dexter-type cultures contain stromal cells that co-express multiple message lineage markers. These pluri-differentiated cells are referred to by the inventor as mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs). Disclosed herein is a process for isolating and purifying MPCs from Dexter-type cultures. Purified MPCs provide a sufficiently defined system to permit detailed elucidation of the role of bone marrow in normal and leukemic hematopoiesis. The present invention is also directed to various methods for using MPCs to enhance bone marrow transplantation, enhance hematopoietic progenitor cell engraftment, for diagnostic purposes, or for the treatment of GvHD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;pluri-differentiated&rdquo; as used herein refers to cells that are a single cell type co-expressing genes specific for multiple lineages. The term &ldquo;pluri-potential&rdquo; as used herein refers to cells that are undifferentiated and have the potential to be differentiated into discrete mesenchymal tissues. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Dexter type bone marrow cultures are a widely used and favorite medium for the study of hematopoiesis. Conventional wisdom has held that the stromal cells in Dexter-type cultures comprise a mixture of macrophages, hematopoietic cells, adipocytes, osteoblasts, fibroblasts, muscle cells, and endothelial cells. As a result of this perceived cellular complexity, research efforts over the last 23 years were not directed to characterizing or isolating the mesenchymal cells from the Dexter-type cultures. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The exact cell types in Dexter cultures have been identified.

Torok-Storb et al., <highlight><italic>Ann NY Acad Sci</italic></highlight>872, 164 (1999)). Instead, the inventor determined that there are only three types of cells in Dexter-type cultures, namely, macrophages (&tilde;35%), hematopoietic cells (&tilde;5%), and a type applicant calls &ldquo;nonhematopoietic cells&rdquo; (&tilde;60%)(FIG. 3, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A, and Table 1). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Bone marrow mesenchymal cells, the nonhematopoietic cells in Dexter type cultures, possess distinctive features that have previously gone unrecognized. There is both direct visual (FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A-E and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) and molecular biological (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) evidence to support the existence of this unique cell type. These findings challenge the prevailing belief that stromal cells derived from Dexter cultures comprise multiple singly-differentiated mesenchymal cell types. Because Dexter cultures represent a primary cell culture system, and not a cell line, these studies indicate that cells in these primary cultures themselves are pluri-differentiated, which has been previously unsuspected. The nonhematopoietic cells of the present invention (MPCs) simultaneously express marker genes specific for multiple mesenchymal cell lineages, including adipocytes, osteoblasts, fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The MPCs in Dexter type cultures were characterized using a variety of techniques. Cytospins were prepared using aliquots of unfractionated cells for performance of various cytological, cytochemical and immunocytochemical stains. Reactivity patterns of the bone marrow culture cells are outlined in Table 1. FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A-E illustrate morphologic and phenotypic characteristics, as uncovered by staining for representative cell lineage markers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Only rarely have investigators in this field taken the approach of preparing a cell suspension and staining cells on cytospins as was done to characterize the cells of the present invention (Simmons, et al, <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>328, p429-32 (1987)) and no other group has used this method to address the issue of pluri-differentiation by bone marrow stromal cells. Almost all of the published studies in the field, with a rare exception (Simmons, et al., <highlight><italic>Nature, </italic></highlight>328, p429-32 (1987)), conducted cytochemical and immunocytochemical staining on layers of stromal cells grown to confluence on coverslips. In this situation, the stromal cultures appear very complex especially in the areas of hematopoietic activity, the so-called &ldquo;cobblestones&rdquo; with macrophages and hematopoietic cells enmeshed in them. Macrophages and nonhematopoietic cells spread themselves and assume varied shapes when they adhere to and grow on plastic or glass that further contributes to the perceived heterogeneity and complexity. The complexity precludes a clear morphological visualization of the nonhematopoietic cells and consequently interfered with the determination of what percent of what cell type is positive for any given marker. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In terms of lineage markers, up to 100% of the nonhematopoietic cells or MPCs of the present invention expressed two fat cell markers (Nile Red (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</cross-reference>) and Oil Red 0); an osteoblast marker (alkaline phosphatase (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>F)); and two fibroblast markers (fibronectin (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4G</cross-reference>) and prolyl-4-hydroxylase). Greater than 85% of the MPCs were also positive for a muscle marker, actin (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4H</cross-reference>). There was no evidence of expression of endothelial cell differentiation, as judged by immunohistochemical staining for CD34 and CD31. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In addition, the Dexter type stromal cells had not previously been subjected to Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining, which revealed a strong and uniform positivity by almost 100% of the MPCs studied indicating the presence of large stores of glycogen (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</cross-reference>). The presence of glycogen (6) was confirmed by electron microscopy (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). In this respect, MPCs are reminiscent of the glycogen-laden reticular cells in the developing bone marrow of human fetuses (observed by L-T. Chen, L. Weiss, <highlight><italic>Blood </italic></highlight>46, 389 (1975)). Glycogen deposition is viewed to be a developmentally regulated process during morphogenesis (H. Ohshima, J. Wartiovaara, I. Thesleff, <highlight><italic>Cell Tissue Res. </italic></highlight>297, 271 (1999)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The MPCs also exhibited cytoplasm compartmentalization into endoplasm and ectoplasm. This morphologic finding sheds light on their internal architecture because of correlation of restricted localization of glycogen and smooth muscle actin to ectoplasm; and of acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphotase, Nile Red, Oil Red 0, fibronectin, and prolyl-4-hydrolase to endoplasm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Additional sets of multiple mesenchymal lineage markers were assessed by Northern blotting of unfractionated cells and purified MPCs to eliminate any observer bias that might be inherent in morphological assessment. FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A-M represent different gene probes used for hybridization. The sources of the gene probes employed and the major transcripts observed are outlined in the brief description of the figures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Compared to unfractionated cells, the purified nonhematopoietic cells expressed significantly higher levels of markers representing fat cells (adipsin, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>D); osteoblasts (osteoblast-specific cadherin-11, chondroitin sulfate, collagen type 1 and decorin, FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>E-H); fibroblasts (fibronectin, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>J); and smooth muscle cells (caldesmon and transgelin, FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>K-L). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Taken together, the morphologic, cytochemical, and immunocytochemical results (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A-H and Table 1), and the Northern blotting data (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>A-M) indicate that the nonhematopoietic stromal cells of the Dexter cultures co-express markers specific for at least four different mesenchymal cell lineages. Using a variety of techniques, applicant has demonstrated that the MPCs co-express multilineage mesenchymal cell phenotypes, and in this respect the multi- or pluri-differentiated MPCs are distinct from the pluri-potential, but undifferentiated, MSCs of Friedenstein cultures (Prockop, <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>276, 71-74 (1997). </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Isolation of MPCs </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The nonhematopoietic cells of the present invention were purified from the macrophages, the dominant &ldquo;contaminating&rdquo; cell type, using a Percoll gradient method developed by applicant. MPCs were purified by the following process: cells from a Dexter-type culture were treated to obtain a cell suspension, the macrophages were removed, and the cells were fractionated using discontinuous Percoll gradient centrifugation (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). The isolated MPCs were then collected and washed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The purity of the nonhematopoietic cells was demonstrated by a near complete absence of two macrophage markers, CD68 and cathepsin B (as shown by Northern blotting data, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A and 6B</cross-reference>). As a positive control, bone marrow mononuclear cells rich in myelomonocytic cells abundantly expressed CD68 (lanes 5 &amp; 6, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference>). The Northern blot results are consistent with a purity estimate of &tilde;95% (vs. 60% in unfractionated samples) based on morphology and immunocytochemical staining for CD68. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> A purified source of MPCs is desirable for a number of reasons. The relative ease with which large numbers of the MPCs can be purified and their distinctive phenotypic characteristics make them valuable targets for future investigations. Purified MPCs provide a sufficiently defined system to permit detailed elucidation of the role of bone marrow in normal and leukemic hematopoiesis in addition to aiding in bone marrow transplantation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Another major reason that purified cells are desirable is that Dexter cultures also contain a significant percentage of highly immunogenic macrophages that can cause onset of GvHD after transplantation. The MPCs of the present invention are purified to &tilde;95% free of macrophages and hematopoietic cells. Note the increased survival rate in SCID mice that received purified MPCs versus those that received unfractionated bone marrow stromal cells in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Enhancing Engraftment </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides methods of enhancing the engraftment of hematopoietic cells and of enhancing the engraftment of bone marrow. The hematopoietic support capacity of the Dexter-type cultures has been repeatedly demonstrated by a number of investigators. RT-PCR analysis showed that Dexter cultures and Friedenstein cultures expressed a similar pattern of cytokine and growth factor mRNAs; yet, Dexter cultures were found to be more efficient than Friedenstein cultures in achieving preservation of hematopoietic progenitors (Majumdar, et al., <highlight><italic>J. Cell. Physiol., </italic></highlight>176, 57-66.). The pluri-differentiated MPC is capable of supporting hematopoiesis, as shown by its ability to express representative hematopoietic growth factors/cytokines, i.e., G-CSF and SCF as well as matrix receptors/hematopoietic cell adhesion molecules, i.e., ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and ALCAM (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Clarification of the nature of the stromal cells and the ability to purify these cells makes it possible to use them as an adjuvant in bone marrow transplantation following high-dose chemotherapy and radiation therapy. These treatment modalities not only cause damage to the hematopoietic stem cells but also to the supportive stromal cells. However, because the bone marrow microenvironment is destroyed, hematopoietic progenitor cell engraftment is delayed until the stromal environment is restored. As a result, a critical aspect of the current invention is directed to the advantages of transplanting isolated mesenchymal progenitor cells to accelerate the process of stromal reconstruction and ultimately bone marrow engraftment. The stromal cells present in the standard bone marrow transplant are not sufficient in number and can be supplemented with the cultured MPCs of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Yet another embodiment of the current invention provides the use of MPC transplantation to major leukemic conditions, such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and multiple myeloma (MM). This is based on applicant&apos;s determination that bone marrow stromal cells in a leukemia patient are functionally and structurally defective, regardless of the damage caused by chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Such defects in bone marrow stromal cells are likely to aid and abet leukemia development. Alternatively, stromal cell defects could be secondarily induced by surrounding leukemia cells, thus contributing to the loss of hematopoietic support function of stromal cells and hematopoietic failure, which is an invariable feature in leukemia. Regardless whether the observed stromal cell defects are primary or secondary to the leukemic process, by reason of their indisputable impact on normal hematopoiesis, these defects remain to be corrected to improve the hematopoietic function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Stromal cells have never been carefully investigated in terms of genomics in view of the widespread belief that they represent a heterogeneous mixture of cell types. Tissue or cellular heterogeneity presents a major challenge for the application of microarray technology. The purified stromal cells of the present invention represent a single pluridifferentiated MPG which allows for genomic study of the stromal cells and the development of new, more objective diagnostic tools for patients suffering from leukemia conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The ability to purify culture-expanded MPCs from both normal individuals and patients afflicted with various leukemias also allows testing of the hematopoietic supportive role of MPCs in mice models. These systems provide an in vivo model in which to examine the role of human bone marrow microenvironment in normal and leukemic hematopoiesis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disease (SCID) mouse model is an ideal system in which to investigate MPC function. Engraftment of human hematopoietic progenitors in SCID mice has required either coadministration of exogenous human cytokines, or cotransplantation of human bone marrow plugs or bone fragments. As disclosed herein MPCs are a convenient, new source for human bone marrow stromal cells for enhancing transplantation that does not require cytokines, bone fragment, or marrow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Unlike prior methods, the isolated MPCs of the present invention support human hematopoiesis in the SCID mouse model as effectively as whole marrow stroma. The transplantation of human marrow mononuclear cells combined with purified MPCs results in dramatically vigorous engraftment of human cells in spleen, bone marrow, liver, pancreas, lungs, stomach, and paravertebral neuronal ganglia of SCID mice (FIGS. <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A-H and FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>A-C). By contrast, mice receiving human bone marrow mononuclear cells alone or MPCs alone expectedly showed no detectable evidence of human hematopoietic cell engraftment (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>A and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">GvHD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides for a method of preventing or treating GvHD. The highest mortality rate, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>B, was observed in mice receiving the unpurified whole marrow stroma and the bone marrow mononuclear cells. The increased mortality observed is related to the presence of highly immunogenic macrophages and consequent GvHD. The mice with the highest survival rate, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>A, were the mice receiving purified MPCs and bone marrow mononuclear cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Notably, there is discrete TUNEL-positive nuclei in the liver of the expired mouse in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>B and complete absence of staining in the liver of the surviving mouse ( see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</cross-reference>). While some ill-defined globules of staining are observed in the spleen of the mouse that survived, the nuclear integrity of most of the cells is well preserved suggesting minimal or no apoptosis (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14C</cross-reference>). In contrast, the dead mouse spleen (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14D</cross-reference>) showed extensive TUNEL positivity precluding accurate interpretation. Control mouse liver and spleen showed results similar to those of the mouse that survived. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The above results indicate that purified MPCs can support human hematopoiesis in SCID mice as effectively as whole marrow stroma. Equally important is that the purified MPCs increased the survival rate. The evidence shows that the increased survival is due to a reduction in GvHD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation is the preferred method of treatment for a variety of malignant and genetic diseases of the blood and blood forming cells. However, failure of hematopoietic cell engraftment can occur for a number of reasons. These include, microenvironmental defects as part of the underlying disease itself (e.g., aplastic anemia), and/or stromal cell damage caused by chemoradiotherapy and/or microenvironmental damage as part of GvHD which is a dreaded complication following bone marrow transplantation. In GvHD, donor T cells present in the hematopoietic cell graft destroy host tissues. GvHD can involve multiple organs such as skin, liver, GI system etc. The current treatment modalities for graft failure or GvHD are cumbersome, costly and involve some form of immunosuppression. Stromal cell lesions either primary to the disease process or secondarily induced by allogeneic bone marrow transplantation play a prominent role in the success or failure of the hematopoietic cell graft. Cotransplantation of MPC not only enhances hematopoietic cell engraftment but also prolongs the life of graft recipients by minimizing GvHD. Co-transplantation of healthy, culture-expanded MPC is a viable option in these situations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The human bone marrow used in tho Dexter-type cultures of the present invention can be obtained from a number of different sources in accordance with the procedures known in the art, including from plugs of femoral head cancerous bone pieces or from aspirated marrow. The cells used in the Dexter culture can be autologous, from the tissue donor, or from other individuals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Modes of administration of MPCs include, but are not limited to, systemic intravenous injection and injection directly to the intended site of activity. The MPCs can be administered by any convenient route, for example by infusion or bolus injection, and can be administered together with other biologically active agents. Administration is preferably systemic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The methods of the present invention can be altered, particularly by (1) increasing or decreasing the time interval between administering MPCs and implanting the tissue, cells, or implanting the organs; (2) increasing or decreasing the amount of MPCs administered; (3) varying the number of MPC administrations; (4) varying the method of delivery of the MPCs; (5) or varying the source of MPCs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The MPC preparations are used in an amount effective to promote engraftment of hematopoietic progenitor cells or bone marrow cells; or for the treatment or prevention of GvHD in the recipient. The pharmaceutically effective amount for the purposes herein is thus determined by such considerations as are known in the art. In general, such amounts are typically at least 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>4 </superscript></highlight>MPCs per kg of body weight and most generally need not be more than 7&times;10<highlight><superscript>5 </superscript></highlight>MPCs/kg. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions. Such compositions comprise a therapeutically effective amount of MPCs and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. Such a carrier includes but is not limited to McCoy&apos;s medium, saline, buffered saline, dextrose, water, and combinations thereof. The formulation should suit the method of administration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the MPC preparation or composition is formulated in accordance with routine procedures as a pharmaceutical composition adapted for intravenous administration to human beings. Typically, compositions for intravenous administration are solutions in sterile isotonic aqueous buffer. Where necessary, the composition can also include a local anesthetic to ameliorate any pain at the site of the injection. Generally, the ingredients are supplied either separately or mixed together in unit dosage form, for example, as a cryopreserved concentrate in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule indicating the quantity of active agent. Where the composition is to be administered by infusion, it can be dispensed with an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade water or saline. Where the composition is administered by injection, an ampoule of sterile water for injection or saline can be provided so that the ingredients can be mixed prior to administration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The present invention paves the way for applications of mesenchymal progenitor cells in the field of transplantation with respect to hematopoietic support, immunoregulation, and graft facilitation. MPCs can be used as a supporting cell type in bone marrow transplantation, particularly in diseases where defects in the hematopoietic stromal microenvironment are believed to prevail, such as aplastic anemia, myelofibrosis, and bone marrow failure following high dose chemotherapy and radiation therapy. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Diagnostic Applications </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the invention provides a method for diagnosing various disease states in mammals by identifying new diagnostic markers, specifically the classification and diagnosis of leukemia. Prior to the present invention, stromal cells were not carefully investigated in terms of genomics because of the widespread belief that they represent a heterogeneous mixture of cell types and cellular heterogeneity presents significant challenges for the application of genetic analysis such as microarray technology. The isolated MPCs of the present invention represent a single cell type and allow for genomic study of the stromal cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Using the methods of the present invention, it has been determined that bone marrow stromal cells in leukemia patients are functionally and structurally defective regardless of the damage caused by chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Given the almost 25 year history and intense interest in bone marrow stromal cell cultures, previous documentation of stromal cell abnormalities has been disappointingly low (Martinez &amp; Martinez, Exp. Hematol 11:522-26 (1983); Budak-Alpdogan, et al., Am.J.Hematol, 62:212-20 (1999); Nagao, et al., Blood, 61:589-92 (1983); Peled, et al., Exp.Hematol 24:728-37 (1996); Bhatia, et al., Blood 85:3636-45 (1995); Agarwal, et al., Blood 85:1306-12 (1995); Diana, et al., Blood 96:357a(2000)). By identifying gene sets that are unique to a given state, these differences in the stromal cells can be utilized for diagnostic purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the invention, isolated MPCs from a patient are assayed for expression of a large number of genes. The gene expression profile is projected into a profile of gene set expression values according to the definition of gene sets. A reference database containing a number of reference projected profiles is also created from the isolated MPCs of patients with known states, such as normal and various leukemic disease states. The projected profile is then compared with the reference database containing the reference projected profiles. If the projected profile of the patient matches best with the profile of a particular disease state in the database, the patient is diagnosed as having such disease state. Various computer systems and software, see Example 5, can be utilized for implementing the analytical methods of this invention and are apparent to one of skill in the art. Some of these software programs include Cluster &amp; TreeView (Stanford, URLs: rana.lbl.gov or www.microarray.org), GeneCluster (MIT/Whitehead Institute, URL: MPR/GeneCluster/GeneCluster.html), Array Explorer (SpotFire Inc, URL: http://www.spotfire.com/products/scicomp.asp&num;SAE) and GeneSpring (Silicon Genetics Inc, URL: http:/www.sigenetics.com/Products/GeneSpring/index.html) (for computer systems and software, see also U.S. Pat. No. 6,203,987). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The methods of the present invention can also be useful for monitoring the progression of diseases and the effectiveness of treatments. For example, by comparing the projected profile prior to treatment with the profile after treatment. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Therapeutic Applications </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> One aspect of the invention provides methods for therapeutic and drug discovery utilizing bone marrow derived isolated mesenchymal progenitor cells. The present invention can be utilized to identify stromal cell genes that can be therapeutic targets for improvement of normal hematopoietic function, which is constantly compromised, in leukemic patients. In one embodiment, gene sets are defined using cluster analysis. The genes within a gene set are indicated as potentially co-regulated under the conditions of interest. Co-regulated genes are further explored as potentially being involved in a regulatory pathway. Identification of genes involved in a regulatory pathway provides useful information for designing and screening new drugs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Some embodiments of the invention employ gene set definition and projection to identify drug action pathways. In one embodiment, the expression changes of a large number of genes in response to the application of a drug are measured. The expression change profile is projected into a gene set expression change profile. In some cases, each of the gene sets represents one particular pathway with a defined biological purpose. By examining the change of gene sets, the action pathway can be deciphered. In some other cases, the expression change profile is compared with a database of projected profiles obtained by perturbing many different pathways. If the projected profile is similar to a projected profile derived from a known perturbation, the action pathway of the drug is indicated as similar to the known perturbation. Identification of drug action pathways is useful for drug discovery. See, Stoughton and Friend, Methods for Identifying pathways of Drug Action, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/074,983. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The invention is further described in detail by reference to the following experimental examples. These examples are provided for the purpose of illustration only, and are not intended to be limiting unless otherwise specified. Thus, the invention should in no way be construed as being limited to the following examples, but rather, should be construed to encompass any and all variations which become evident as a result of the teaching provided herein. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLES </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The examples presented in this experiment can be summarized as follows. The data disclosed herein demonstrate that Dexter cultures consist of only three cell types macrophages (&tilde;35%), hematopoietic cells (&tilde;5%), and nonhematopoietic cells (&tilde;60%). Using a percoll gradient centrifugation technique, the nonhematopoietic mesenchymal progenitor cells were isolated, free of macrophages and hematopoietic cells. A variety of techniques were used to identify the isolated cells as a multi-differentiated mesenchymal cell lineage co-expressing genes specific for multiple mesenchymal cell lineages including adipocytes, osteoblasts, fibroblasts and muscle cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Evidence that this multi- or pluri-differentiated mesenchymal progenitor cell is capable of supporting hematopoiesis is shown by the expression of a number of hematopoietic growth factors and extracellular matrix receptors. The SCID mouse experimental data provides evidence that since the MPCs can be purified to near homogeneity (95%) with relative ease, MPCs can be of value for enhancing engraftment of hematopoietic stem cells and bone marrow transplants. Additionally, increased survival rate in the SCID mouse model indicates that isolated MPCs can also be useful for the treatment of GvHD. An example of the administration of bone marrow cells and MPCs to breast cancer patients treated with chemotherapy is also provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> A stepwise genomics strategy and an example of the genomic changes observed in leukemia associated MPCs is also provided. Cluster analysis was performed to show gene expression patterns in isolated MPCs of a normal individual and individuals with different leukemic conditions. The approach presented provides the basis for a new more objective means to diagnose patients suffering from leukemic conditions. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Bone Marrow Culture </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Bone marrow samples were obtained from posterior superior iliac crest under general anesthesia for standard marrow transplantation. Marrow stromal cell cultures were set up using the residual cells recovered from the filters of Fenwal Bone Marrow Collection System after complete filtration of the marrow samples. The filters were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline without Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> and Mg<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> (PBS-CMF). The cell suspension was subjected to Ficoll gradient isolation of the mononuclear cells (bone marrow MNCs). The bone marrow MNCs were washed (&times;2) in PBS-CMF and suspended in McCoy&apos;s 5A with HEPES medium containing 12.5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 12.5% horse serum, 1 &mgr;M/L hydrocortisone and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (for this study McCoy&apos;s complete medium) and cultured under standard stromal-cell culture conditions (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) (Seshi, et al. <highlight><italic>Blood </italic></highlight>83, 2399 (1994) and Gartner, et al. <highlight><italic>Proc Natl Acad Sci USA </italic></highlight>77, 4756 (1980). After two weeks, confluent stromal cell cultures were trypsinized (first passage), followed by splitting each T75 flask into two T150 flasks. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Morphologic and Phenotypic Characteristics of MPCs as Uncovered by Staining for Representative Mesenchymal Cell Lineage Markers </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Two weeks after the first passage (above), confluent stromal cells were again trypsinized. Cytospins were prepared using aliquots of unfractionated cells for performance of various cytological, cytochemical and immunocytochemical stains. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Reactivity patterns of the bone marrow culture cells are outlined in Table 1. FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A-E illustrate morphologic and phenotypic characteristics, as uncovered by staining for representative cell lineage markers. As illustrated in Table 1 and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>A, Wright-Giemsa staining revealed three morphologically identifiable cell populations in Dexter type stromal cell cultures, macrophages, hematopoietic cells, and nonhematopoietic cells (labeled 4, 3, and 5, respectively). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The identity of macrophages was confirmed by immunostain using anti-CD68 antibody (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference>) and cytochemical stains for acid phosphatase and Sudan black. The identity of hematopoietic cells (including macrophages) was confirmed by immunostain using anti-CD45 antibody (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The remaining nonhematopoietic cells stained intensely positive for Periodic acid-Schiff, which was diastase sensitive, signifying the presence of large stores of glycogen (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</cross-reference>). The presence of glycogen (6) was confirmed by electron microscopy (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). In this respect, MPCs are reminiscent of the glycogen-laden reticular cells in the developing bone marrow of human fetuses (observed by L-T. Chen, L. Weiss, <highlight><italic>Blood </italic></highlight>46, 389 (1975)). Glycogen deposition is viewed to be a developmentally regulated process during morphogenesis (H. Ohshima, J. Wartiovaara, I. Thesleff, <highlight><italic>Cell Tissue Res. </italic></highlight>297, 271 (1999)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> In terms of lineage markers, up to 100% of the nonhematopoietic cells expressed two fat cell markers (Nile Red (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</cross-reference>) and Oil Red O); an osteoblast marker (alkaline phosphatase (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>F)); and two fibroblast markers (fibronectin (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4G</cross-reference>) and prolyl-4-hydroxylase). Greater than 85% of the nonhematopoietic cells were also positive for a muscle marker, actin (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4H</cross-reference>). There was no evidence of expression of endothelial cell differentiation, as judged by immunohistochemical staining for CD34 and CD31 (data not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> The results indicate that the nonhematopoietic cells of the Dexter cultures are in fact a single, pluri-differentiated cell type co-expressing multiple mesenchymal cell lineage markers. The pluri-differentiated mesenchymal progenitor cells reported here are to be distinguished from the pluri-potential, but undifferentiated, MSCs that are generated in the absence of hematopoietic cells, such as in Friedenstein-type cultures.

<heading lvl="1">Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Progenitor Cell (MPC) Purification </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> To further investigate the characteristics of the MPCs, the nonhematopoietic stromal cells were then purified from the macrophages (&tilde;95% pure), the dominant &ldquo;contaminating&rdquo; cell type using the following method. Confluent monolayers of stromal cells resulting from first passage, above, were washed for three minutes in Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>/Mg<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> free Hanks&apos; balanced salt solution. Cells were incubated at room temperature for 45 minutes with intermittent mixing in serum-free McCoy&apos;s medium containing 10 mM L-leucine methyl ester (LME, Sigma). LME is a lysosomotropic agent that selectively kills and detaches macrophages. The detached macrophages were removed by washing the monolayers twice in McCoy&apos;s complete medium, followed by trypsinization of the monolayers. The resulting single cell suspensions were fractionated by discontinuous Percoll gradient (70%, 50%, 30%, 20%, 10%) centrifugation at 800&times;G for 15 minutes at 4&deg; C. in a fixed angle rotor (Avanti-J25 Beckman centrifuge) (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). Low-density cells representing the macrophages resistant to detachment by LME separate as a band at the interface of serum and 10% Percoll and were discarded (1). High-density nonhematopoietic cells representing MPCs form a layer in the region of 30-50% Percoll (2). These were collected and washed twice by centrifugation through PBS-CMF. This protocol is conservatively expected to yield, &gt;2.5&times;10<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>MPCs per T-150 flask (i.e., &gt;50&times;10<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>MPCs per batch of 20 flasks). The purity of these preparations, typically about 95%, was routinely monitored by Wright-Giemsa staining. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Northern Blotting </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Additional sets of multiple mesenchymal lineage markers were assessed by Northern blotting to eliminate any observer bias that might be inherent in morphological assessment. FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A-M represent different gene probes used for hybridization. The sources of the gene probes employed and the major transcripts observed are outlined in the brief description of the figures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Total RNA was prepared by dissolving the high-density cell pellets in Trizol (Life-Technologies). Total RNA samples from unfractionated stromal cells and BM MNCs were similarly prepared. The RNA samples were electrophoresed in a standard 1% agarose gel containing 2% formaldehyde in MOPS/EDTA buffer and blotted onto Immobilon-Ny&plus; membrane. Probes were labeled using Prime-A-Gene Kit (Promega) and a<highlight><superscript>32</superscript></highlight>P dCTP (NEN). Hybridization was performed at 65&deg; C. in modified Church&apos;s hybridization solution using 3&times;10<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>counts/ml in 10 ml (Millipore, 1998). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> In FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A-M, Northern blot analysis was performed side-by-side on fractionated stromal cells, nonhematopoietic cells freed of macrophages, and initial bone marrow mononuclear cell samples. Lanes 1 and 2 represent total RNA samples (10 &mgr;g each) from unfractionated stromal cells (subjects S1 and S2, respectively). Lanes 3 and 4 represent total RNA samples (10 &mgr;g each) from purified stromal MPCs (subjects S1 and S2, respectively). Lanes 5 and 6 represent total RNA samples (10 &mgr;g each) from bone marrow mononuclear cells, the starting cells for bone marrow cell cultures (subjects S3 and S4, respectively). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The large transcripts, especially of collagen (lane 1, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6G</cross-reference>) and fibronectin (lane 1, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6J</cross-reference>), in RNA extracted from unfractionated stromal cells of subject 1 showed difficulty migrating into the gel. This observation correlates with the presence of an artifact of unresolved positive material in lane 1, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference>. Since the RNA extracted from unfractionated stromal cells of the subject 2 did not present this problem (lane 2, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>G, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>J and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference>), the observation does not impact on the overall interpretation of the results (see text). The lineages of markers tested were: monocyte/macrophage markers, CD68 and cathepsin B; adipocyte marker, adipsin; osteoblast markers, osteoblast-specific cadherin-11, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 2, collagen type I alpha 1 and decorin; fibroblast marker, fibronectin; muscle markers, caldesmon and transgelin. Marker signals were normalized to the amount of RNA loaded, which was based on densitometry of the GAPDH signals on the corresponding blot (Bio-Rad Model GS-700 Imaging Densitometer). Attenuation or enhancement of the marker signals in the purified stromal MPCs (i.e., lanes 3 and 4) relative to unfractionated stromal cells (i.e., lanes 1 and 2, respectively) is shown as fold &Dgr; (decrease/increase) underneath the lanes 3 and 4; ND, means not determined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The purity of the nonhematopoietic cells was demonstrated by a near complete absence of two macrophage markers, CD68 and cathepsin B (as shown by Northern blotting data, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A and 6B</cross-reference>). As a positive control, bone marrow mononuclear cells rich in myelomonocytic cells abundantly expressed CD68 (lanes 5 &amp; 6, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference>). The Northern blot results are consistent with a purity estimate of &tilde;95% (vs. 60% in unfractionated samples) based on morphology and immunocytochemical staining for CD68. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Compared to unfractionated cells, the purified nonhematopoietic cells expressed significantly higher levels of markers representing fat cells (adipsin, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>D); osteoblasts (osteoblast-specific cadherin-11, chondroitin sulfate, collagen type 1 and decorin, FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>E-H); fibroblasts (fibronectin, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>J); and smooth muscle cells (caldesmon and transgelin, FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>K-L). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> No trace of osteoblast, fibroblast, or smooth muscle cell markers were detected in the bone marrow mononuclear cells, suggesting a less than detectable level of stromal cells or their precursors in bone marrow mononuclear cells. However, the fat cell marker, adipsin, was detected in all samples including the bone marrow mononuclear cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Taken together, the morphologic, cytochemical and immunocytochemical results (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A-H and Table 1), and the Northern blotting data (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>A-M) indicate that the nonhematopoietic stromal cells of the Dexter cultures co-express markers specific for at least four different mesenchymal cell lineages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> This finding is especially intriguing because pluri-differentiation is often a feature of neoplastic cells (Brambilia and Brambilia, <highlight><italic>Rev.

<heading lvl="1">RT-PCR Analysis for Expression of Representative Hematopoietic Growth Factors and Extracellular Matrix Receptors by MPCs </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> RT-PCR was conducted in a total reaction volume of 100 &mgr;l using 2 &mgr;g each of total RNA; corresponding primers; and a master mix of the PCR reagents. The RT conditions included sequential incubations at 42&deg; C. for 15 minutes, 99&deg; C. for five minutes, and 5&deg; C. for five minutes. The PCR conditions included: initial melting at 94&deg; C. for four minutes; and cyclical melting at 94&deg; C. for 45 seconds, annealing at 55&deg; C. for 45 seconds and extension at 72&deg; C. for 45 seconds with 34 cycles. PCR was terminated after final extension at 72&deg; C. for ten minutes. Reaction products (G-CSF, SCF, each 25 &mgr;l; VCAM-1, ALCAM, each 50 &mgr;l; ICAM-1, 75 &mgr;l) were concentrated as necessary; electrophoresed along with a 100-bp DNA ladder (GIBCO-BRL) in a standard agarose (1%) gel in TAE buffer; and stained with ethidium bromide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> PCR products, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> lanes labeled 1-2, were generated using aliquots of the same RNA samples from purified stromal MPCs, as used for Northern blotting shown under <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> lanes 3 and 4 respectively. The gene transcripts amplified were as follows: G-CSF (granulocyte-colony stimulating factor); (Tachibana et al., Br. <highlight><italic>J. Cancer, </italic></highlight>76, 163-74 (1997); SCF (stem cell factor, i.e., c-Kit ligand); (Saito et al., <highlight><italic>Biochem, Biophys. Res. Commun., </italic></highlight>13, 1762-69 (1994); ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule-1, CD54) and VCAM-1 (vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, CD106) (primers from R&amp;D); and ALCAM (activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule, CD166) (Bruder et al., J. Bone Miner. Res., 13, 655-63 (1998)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The observed PCR products for G-CSF (600 bp, i.e., the top bright band) and ALCAM (175 bp) were significantly different from the expected sizes (278 bp; 372 bp, respectively). However, sequencing of the gel-purified PCR bands and subsequent BLAST search showed a 99-100% identity with respective members. Attempts to detect c-Kit (i.e., SCF receptor) using primers as described (Saito et al., <highlight><italic>Biochem, Biophys. Res. Commun., </italic></highlight>13, 1762-69 (1994)) amplified a PCR product of &tilde;300 bp with no homology to c-Kit (data not shown). The observed product sizes for SCF (&tilde;730 bp); ICAM-1 (&tilde;750 bp); and VCAM-1 (&tilde;500 bp) were as expected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, RT-PCR analysis showed that purified, multi-differentiated MPCs express both critical hematopoietic growth factor/cytokines, such as G-CSF and SCF as well as matrix receptors/hematopoietic cell adhesion molecules, i.e. ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and ALCAM. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> The Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disease (SCID) mouse model is an ideal system in which to investigate MPC function. Engraftment of human hematopoietic progenitors in SCID mice requires either coadministration of exogenous human cytokines, or cotransplantation of human bone marrow plugs or bone fragments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> There has been discovered a convenient, new source for human bone marrow stromal cells for enhancing transplantation that does not require cytokines, bone fragment, or marrow. Unlike prior methods, the isolated cells of the present invention support human hematopoiesis in the SCID mouse model as effectively as whole marrow stroma. The transplantation of human marrow mononuclear cells combined with purified MPCs results in dramatically vigorous engraftment of human cells in spleen, bone marrow, liver, pancreas, lungs, stomach, and paravertebral neuronal ganglia of SCID mice. By contrast, mice receiving human bone marrow mononuclear cells alone or MPCs alone expectedly showed no detectable evidence of human hematopoietic cell engraftment. Also notably, the mortality rate was highest in mice that received unfractionated whole marrow stroma whereas purified MPC increased the survival rate which can be due to reduction in GvHD. </paragraph>

Alternatively, one could use NOD/SCID mice lacking NK cell function, however, in light of highly promising preliminary results it was elected to continue use of scid/scid mice. The antibody treatment schedule included four-hour pre-engraftment and every seven days thereafter for the duration of the experiment. On the day of transplantation, the mice were irradiated with 200 or 300 cGy gamma-irradiation from a <highlight><superscript>137</superscript></highlight>CS source.

<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> The patient also undergoes placement of a pheresis central venous catheter, and receives subcutaneous injections of G-CSF (filgrastin) 10 &mgr;g/kg/day as described in Peters, et al, Blood, Vol. 81, pgs. 1709-1719 (1993); Chao, et al, Blood, Vol. 81, pgs. 2031-2035 (1993); Sheridan, et al, The Lancet, Vol. 2, pgs. 891-895 (1989); and Winter, et al, Blood, Vol. 82, pg. 293a (1993). G-CSF injections begin at least three days before the first pheresis is initiated. G-CSF therapy is withheld if the white blood cell count rises above 40,000 &mgr;L and is resumed once the white blood cell count drops to less than 20,000 &mgr;L. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> If the patient is receiving only G-CSF as the vehicle for &ldquo;mobilization&rdquo; of peripheral blood progenitor cells, the patient must not have received chemotherapy within four weeks of the planned pheresis. If the patient has received both conventional chemotherapy and G-CSF treatment for mobilization, the patient must not have received chemotherapy within ten days of the planned pheresis, and the white blood cell count must be at least 800/&mgr;L and the platelet count at least 30,000/&mgr;L. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Daily pheresis procedures are performed using a Cobe Spectra instrument (Cobe, Lakewood, Colo.), and each cellular collection is cryopreserved using a controlled-rate liquid nitrogen freezer, until at least 15&times;10<highlight><superscript>8 </superscript></highlight>mononuclear cells/kg are collected (Lazarus, et al., Bone Marrow Transplant, Vol. 7, pgs 241-246 (1991)).

<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> Eight days before the patient is infused with the autologous peripheral blood progenitor cells, the patient receives chemotherapy over a period of 96 hours (four days), with the following chemotherapy agents: 1) Cyclophosphamide in a total dosage of 6 g/m<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>(1.5 g/m 2/day for four days) is given via continuous intravenous infusion at 500 mg/M<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>in 1,000 ml normal saline every eight hours; 2) Thiotepa in a total dosage of 500 mg/m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/day for four days) is given via continuous intravenous infusion at 125 mg/<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>in 1,000 ml normal saline every 24 hours; and 3) Carboplatin in a total dosage of 1,800 mg/m<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>(200 mg/m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/day for four days) is given via continuous intravenous infusion at 200 mg/m<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>in 1,000 ml of 5% dextrose in water every 24 hours. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> The patient also receives 500 mg of Mesna in 50 ml normal saline IV over 15 minutes every four hours for six days (144 hours), beginning with the first dose of cyclophosphamide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> At least 72 hours after the completion of the chemotherapy, the MPCs are harvested from the Dexter culture(s). MPCs are collected and purified as described in Example 1. Cells are resuspended at approximately 10<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>cells/ml, and injected slowly intravenously over 15 minutes to provide a total dosage of from 10 to about 5&times;10<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> MPCs can also be frozen and thawed to use when needed. For example, unfractionated cells from a Dexter culture are frozen. Upon thawing the cells are plated for about two days. The MPCs are then purified as in Example 1 above. The MPCs are then replated with serum or in a serum free media and can remain stable for up to six days. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> The day after the patient receives the MPCs, the frozen autologous peripheral blood progenitor cells are removed from the liquid nitrogen refrigerator, transported to the patient in liquid nitrogen, submersed in a 37&deg; C. to 40&deg; C. sterile water bath, and infused rapidly intravenously without additional filtering or washing steps. GM-CSF in an amount of 250 &mgr;g/m<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>then is given as a daily subcutaneous injection, beginning three hours after completion of the autologous blood progenitor cell infusion.

<heading lvl="1">Genomic Changes Observed in Leukemia Associated MPCs </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> The following is one example of how normal hematopoiesis might be compromised in leukemic conditions. The cellular interactions that underlie leukemic bone marrow involve stromal cells, leukemia/ lymphoma cells, and normal hematopoietic progenitors (including those of myelopoiesis, erythropoiesis and megakaryocytopoiesis). In addition to displacing normal hematopoietic cells, the leukemia/ lymphoma cells can potentially cause direct damage to the hematopoietic supportive stromal cells by inducing unwanted gene expression profiles and adversely affecting the normal hematopoiesis. The cellular interactions can be schematized as:

</chemistry-cwu>
</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> The point of this scheme is that regardless of whether stromal cell lesions are primary or secondary to leukemogenesis, the normal hematopoietic function is invariably compromised in leukemic conditions, though different leukemias affect myelopoiesis, erythropoiesis and megakaryocytopoiesis differentially. Contrary to the prevailing notion (see Marini, F et al., Mesenchymal Stem Cells from Patients with Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia Patients can be Transduced with Common Gene Transfer Vectors at High Efficiency, and are Genotypically Normal, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><superscript>nd </superscript></highlight>Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology, Dec. 1-5, 2000 Poster &num; 665), there has been observed extensive and striking gene expression changes in leukemia-associated bone marrow MPCs by using high-resolution genomics. Therefore, one embodiment of the present invention is to use transplantation of tissue-culture expanded, purified normal MPCs to improve granulopoiesis, erythropoiesis and thrombopoiesis, in for example MDS (most of MDS patients do not die from blast transformation but from complications related to cytopenias, i.e., hematopoietic failure). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> The studies targeted acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and multiple myeloma (MM), one case of each. The AML patient was a 57 year-old woman with 52% myeloblasts in the bone marrow with immunophenotype confirmed by flow cytometry and a karyotypic abnormality of 45, XX, &minus;7(6)/46, XX &lsqb;6&rsqb;. Together with morphology, the diagnosis was AML arising in a background of myelodysplasia. The CML patient was a 35 year-old man with 2% blasts in the bone marrow and karyotypic abnormalities of Philadelphia chromosome and BCR/ABL gene rearrangement. Together with morphology, the diagnosis was CML in chronic phase. The MM patient was a 61 year-old woman with a IgA myeloma. The serum IgA level was 2.4 g/dl and the marrow plasma cell count was 37%. None of the patients was treated prior to obtaining marrow samples used in this study, to avoid any therapy-induced changes complicating the disease-associated changes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> The leukemic samples consisted of marrow aspirates that remained unused after clinical diagnostic studies were preformed. A bone marrow sample obtained from an adult healthy male who had consented to donate bone marrow for standard marrow transplantation was simultaneously studied. The normal bone marrow sample consisted of residual cells recovered from the filters after complete filtration of the marrow sample. Setting up of Dexter-type stromal cell cultures and isolation of MPC were as described in Example 1. The normal stromal cells were studied without and after stimulation with TNF&agr; because TNF&agr; (and IL-4) are regarded as negative regulators of hematopoiesis. Notably these cytokines, especially TNF &agr;, are elevated in marrow plasma of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), the clinical hallmarks of which are anemia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia (i.e., pancytopenia). TNF&agr; and IL-4 are considered possible mediators of hematopoietic dysregulation typical of MDS. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> Genes with correlated expression across bone marrow MPC types: GeneSpring was used for cluster analysis. Prior to application of an agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm, microarray signals were normalized across experiments (i.e., from one MPC type to another) making the median value of all of measurements unity, so different experiments are comparable to one another. The signals were also normalized across genes in order to remove the differing intensity signals from multiple experimental readings. Genes that are inactive across all samples were eliminated from analysis. Notably, 7398 genes out of 12,626 genes (present on the Affymetrix genechip used) passed the filter of a normalized signal intensity of at least 0.1 across at least one of the five experiments performed. Cluster analysis was performed with standard correlation (same as Pearson correlation around zero) as the distance metric, a separation ratio of 0.5 and a minimum distance of 0.001 as provided by the software application. A closer relationship between CML- and MM-associated MPCs was observed, which in turn are related to AML-associated MPC, thus transforming global patterns of gene expression into potentially meaningful relationships. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> Two-dimensional cluster analysis of tissue vs. gene expression vectors: A gene tree was constructed. Genes cluster near each other on the &ldquo;gene tree&rdquo; if they exhibit a strong correlation across MPC experiments and MPC tree branches move near each other if they exhibit a similar gene expression profile. The data indicated that the two-way clustering readjusted the location of a number of genes resulting in accentuation of genomic signatures of each cell type. Investigators can usefully catalog genes composing any unique or signature cluster of interest by creating a gene list and disclosing their identities. </paragraph>

SOM algorithm was applied as provided by GeneSpring. Visualization of SOM clusters in combination with hierarchical clustering (i.e., MPC tree) revealed correlated meaningful patterns of gene expression. Predicated on the basis of SOM operating principle, the related SOM clusters tend to be located physically close to each other. For example, the juxtaposition of the SOM clusters with the common denominator containing genes that are up-regulated in AML/MDS-associated MPC. Whole or part of any SOM cluster can be selected to make a gene list providing the identities of the genes involved. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> Lists of genes that are down-regulated in leukemia-associated MPC (AMUMDS, CML and MM) were created in comparison to normal MPC. A Venn diagram was made using these three gene lists. GeneSpring allows creation of sublists of genes corresponding to union, intersection and exclusion. Transcriptional profiles of any of these sublists of genes can be visualized across MPC samples of interest. The following is one such sublist of genes containing genes that are highly expressed in normal MPC and down-regulated in leukemia-associated MPCs revealing the identity of the subset of genes of interest: putative, wg66h09.x1 Soares Homo sapiens cDNA clone, Homo sapiens mRNA for CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase, Homo sapiens cDNA clone DKFZp586G0421 (symptom: hutel), Human mRNA for histone H1x, Putative monocarboxylate transporterHomo sapiens gene for LD78 alpha precursor, Interacts with SH3 proteins; similar to c-cbl proto-oncogene product, wg82b12.x1 Soares Homo sapiens cDNA clone, Human atrial natriuretic peptide clearance receptor (ANP C-receptor) mRNA, Human 71 kDa 2&prime;5&prime; oligoadenylate synthetase (p69 2-5A synthetase) mRNA, Homo sapiens hMmTRA1 b mRNA, Human GOS2 protein gene, Preproenkephalin, Human guanylate binding protein isoform I (GBP-2) mRNA, Human gene for hepatitis C associated microtubular aggregate protein p44, 17-kDa protein, Human insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5 (IGFBP5) mRNA, GS3686, Human monoamine oxidase B (MAOB) mRNA, Insulin-like growth factor 11 precursor, Human insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5 (IGFBP5) mRNA, Similar to ribosomal protein L21, X-linked mental retardation candidate gene, and Homo sapiens mRNA; cDNA DKFZp434A202. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Visualizing Expression of Phenotypically &amp; Functionally Relevant Genes Across Samples of Normal &amp; Disease-associated BM MPC </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> Although GeneSpring is a highly flexible and user-friendly software application, it lacks the facility to create functionally relevant gene lists containing user-defined key words. This limitation was overcome by devising the following method via Microsoft Excel. A stepwise protocol to create such a gene list using Excel includes: Open the annotated microarray genome file (e.g., Affymetrix U95A) in Excel&rarr;select the column with gene names&rarr;select Data from pull-down menu&rarr;Filter&rarr;AutoFilter&rarr;Custom&rarr;enter key words (e.g., cell adhesion or cell cycle)&rarr;OK&rarr;generates a new Excel worksheet with the list of genes containing the key words. Copy and paste the list of genes containing the key words into GeneSpring and save the gene list with a meaningful name. Twenty-two (22) such functionally relevant gene lists (Table 2) were created. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> The resulting approach is a simple and powerful way to peer into the expression profiles of focused sets of functionally relevant genes across samples of interest. For example, the human vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) gene is completely down-regulated in AML/MDS and the human insulin-like growth factor binding protein (hIGFBP1) gene is up-regulated in AML compared to all other samples. Similarly, <highlight><italic>Homo sapiens </italic></highlight>gene for LD78 alpha precursor is down-regulated in all of leukemia-associated MPCs. Finally, the lineage markers CD45 and CD68 are essentially absent from the leukemia-associated MPCs attesting to the high degree of purity achieved by the sample preparation technique of the present invention. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Results </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> The genomic changes observed in leukemia-associated MPCs are striking. As shown in Table 2, the changes (up-regulation and/or down-regulation) involved hundreds of genes. These changes were most dramatic in MPC associated with AML arising in a background of MDS and involved multiple classes of genes (Tables 1-2). Expectedly, the TNFa-induced changes were extensive. Given the high level of purity of MPC preparations, the enormous genomic changes observed are reflective of the underlying pathologic lesions in the MPCs themselves (and not due to the contaminating leukemic cells and/or macrophages). These studies strongly support the hypothesis that stromal cells in a leukemic patient are functionally defective and therefore purified MPCs are of value in restoring the loss of hematopoietic function in leukemic patients.
