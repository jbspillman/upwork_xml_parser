<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to the field of interactive television systems. More specifically, the present invention relates to systems and methods for providing noise reduction for teleconferencing within an interactive television system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Television watching is an immensely popular pastime throughout the world. Indeed, one or more televisions can be found in virtually every residence in the United States and many foreign countries. The television viewing area is often the focal point of the home, a location at which family members spend a considerable amount of time, even when not watching television. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> For many, the television viewing experience is enhanced by watching television programs with other people. Thus, typical residences are equipped with numerous seats in front of a television to accommodate several family members and friends. Certain television programs are more frequently viewed in the company of others. For example, sporting events, television premieres, political debates, and other significant television broadcasts are typically viewed by groups of people. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Often it is inconvenient for viewers to be physically present in the same room due to geographical distances, conflicting schedules, short notice, and other limitations. In such instances, viewers may watch a television program individually and then meet at a later time to discuss the program. However, if the viewers are unable to meet for an extended period of time, a discussion of the program may become stale. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, viewers may teleconference during a program (e.g., call one another on a telephone) for a more interactive discourse. Unfortunately, conventional teleconferencing presents a number of disadvantages. For example, extended teleconferencing during a broadcast may deprive other household members of the use of the telephone. Moreover, a telephone may not be easily accessible at the viewer&apos;s location, and relocating a telephone to the viewer&apos;s location may be difficult or inconvenient, particularly after a program has commenced. In addition, teleconferencing may be expensive, particularly where more than two parties are connected simultaneously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Moreover, teleconferencing during a television broadcast is problematic because the sound from the television may interfere with the viewer&apos;s voice so that the person with whom the viewer is teleconferencing may find it difficult to understand the viewer. The extent of the interference may depend on a number of factors, including the volume of the television, the location of the television with respect to a microphone used for teleconferencing, the environment, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Thus, it would be an advancement in the art to provide a convenient technique for conversing during a television broadcast with one or more other viewers at remote physical locations. It would be a further advancement in the art to provide a cost-effective system for conferencing which provides minimal disruption of the television program being viewed. In addition, it would be an advancement to provide systems and methods for reducing unwanted noise from the conversation, such as the sound of the television.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The present invention solves the foregoing problems and disadvantages by providing systems and methods for reducing noise during teleconferencing within an interactive television system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> An interactive television system includes, in one embodiment, a hybrid communicator/remote control and a set top box. The hybrid communicator/remote control is configured to control various functions of the interactive television system, e.g., changing channels, adjusting the volume, etc. In addition, the hybrid communicator/remote control is configured to function as a communication device, with an integrated microphone, speaker, wireless receiver, and wireless transmitter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The set top box includes a wireless receiver for receiving transmissions from the wireless transmitter of the hybrid communicator/remote control. Moreover, the set top box is configured to establish a two-way communication channel with a remote user by means of a network, such as a broadband communication network, telephone network, satellite network, or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the set top box includes a noise cancellation module to reduce unwanted noise, such as television sound, from audio input captured by the microphone of the hybrid communicator/remote control. The noise cancellation module may include an adaptive filter for noise cancellation, or may use other techniques known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the set top box may include an output suppression module to eliminate television sound from a captured audio signal. In one configuration, the output suppression module suppresses all television sound while audio input is being captured by the hybrid communicator/remote control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;contact&rdquo; refers to a person to whom a caller may wish to communicate. A &ldquo;contact list&rdquo; refers to stored data relating to one or more contacts. An &ldquo;address&rdquo; identifies or locates a device capable of telephonic communication, such as a telephone, an interactive television system (including the described hybrid communicator/remote control), a wireless communication device (e.g., cellular phone), a computer including hardware and software for Internet-based telephony, or the like. Thus, the term &ldquo;address&rdquo; contemplates various types of network addresses, such as telephone numbers, IP addresses, URLs (Universal Resource Locators), MAC (Media Access Control) addresses, and the like. The term &ldquo;visual identifier&rdquo; may refer to any visual indication of the identity of a contact, including text, pictures, symbols, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Reference throughout this specification to &ldquo;one embodiment&rdquo; or &ldquo;an embodiment&rdquo; means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Thus, appearances of the phrases &ldquo;in one embodiment&rdquo; or &ldquo;in an embodiment&rdquo; in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the described features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments. In the following description, numerous specific details are provided, such as examples of programming, user selections, network transactions, database queries, database structures, etc., to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments of the invention. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize, however, that the invention can be practiced without one or more of the specific details, or with other methods, components, materials, etc. In other instances, well-known structures, materials, or operations are not shown or described in detail to avoid obscuring aspects of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Throughout the following disclosure, the term &ldquo;coupled&rdquo; may be used to refer to components that are either directly connected to one another, indirectly connected to one another by one or more other components, or that the components may communicate through a wired or wireless connection either directly or indirectly. Thus, as used herein, the term &ldquo;coupled&rdquo; may be synonymous with &ldquo;in electrical or electronic communication with&rdquo; or simply &ldquo;in communication with.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, there is shown a system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> for providing television programming and communication services to a plurality of customers. In one implementation, the system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> include is based on the infrastructure of broadband communication network <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, such as a cable network. However, other networks are contemplated, one particular example of which is a satellite network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In one configuration, the system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of set top boxes (STBs) <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> located, for instance, at customer homes. Generally, an STB <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is a consumer electronics device that serves as a gateway between a customer&apos;s television <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and the network <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. In alternative embodiments, an STB <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may be embodied more generally as a personal computer (PC), an advanced television <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> with built-in STB functionality, or another type of client terminal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> An STB <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> receives encoded television signals and other information from the network <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and decodes the same for display on the television <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> or other display device, such as a computer monitor, projection screen television, high-definition (HD) television, flat panel display, or the like. As its name implies, an STB <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is typically located on top of, or in close proximity to, the television <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The STB <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may also send and receive video and/or audio signals for teleconferencing through use of the network <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Each STB <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may be distinguished from other network components by a unique identifier, number, code, or address, examples of which include an IP (Internet Protocol) address or a MAC (Media Access Control) address. Thus, video and/or audio streams and other information may be transmitted from the network <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to a specific STB <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> by specifying the corresponding address, after which the network <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> routes the transmission to its destination using conventional techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> As described more fully below, a hybrid communicator/remote control <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is provided, in one configuration, for convenient remote operation of the STB <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the television <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The hybrid communicator/remote control <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> may use infrared (IR), radio frequency (RF), or other wireless technologies to transmit control signals to the STB <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the television <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Other remote control devices are also contemplated, such as a wired or wireless mice (not shown), PDAs, webpads, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, each STB <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is coupled to a head-end <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> or other distribution node of the network <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. In the context of a cable network, a head-end <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is generally a centrally-located facility within a community where television programming is received from a satellite downlink or other source and packaged together for transmission to customer homes. In one configuration, a head-end <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> also functions as a Central Office (CO) in the telephone industry, routing data streams to and from the various STBs <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> serviced thereby. Head-ends <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be coupled directly to one another or through the network <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. In alternative embodiments, head-ends <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be connected via a separate network, one particular example of which is the Internet <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The network <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is preferably coupled to one or more television programming sources <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, which provide television programming for distribution to the STBs <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. In one configuration, television programs are distributed in an encoded format, such as MPEG (Moving Picture Experts Group). Various MPEG formats are known, such as MPEG-2, MPEG-4, MPEG-7, and the like. Thus, the term &ldquo;MPEG,&rdquo; as used herein, contemplates all MPEG formats. Moreover, other video encoding/compression standards exist other than MPEG, such as JPEG, JPEG-LS, H.261, and H.263. Accordingly, the invention should not be construed as being limited only to MPEG. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The network <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is also preferably coupled to the Internet <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to provide access thereto by the STBs <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The Internet <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is a &ldquo;network of networks&rdquo; and is well known to those skilled in the art. Communication over the Internet <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is accomplished using standard protocols, such as TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet protocol) and the like. </paragraph>

The communication may be accomplished using the wireless transmitter <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and receiver <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> of the hybrid communicator/remote control <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> While the following description refers primarily to a broadband cable network <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, the invention is not limited in this respect. A satellite delivery system may also be used, such as direct broadcast satellite (DBS) system. A DBS system may include a small 18-inch satellite dish (which is an antenna for receiving a satellite broadcast signal); a digital integrated receiver/decoder (IRD), which separates each channel and decompresses and translates the digital signal for display by a television; and a remote control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Programming for a DBS system may be distributed, for example, by multiple high-power satellites in geosynchronous orbit, each with multiple transponders. Compression (e.g., MPEG) is used to increase the amount of programming that can be transmitted in the available bandwidth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> A digital broadcast center may be used to gather programming content, ensure its digital quality, and transmit the signal up to the satellites. Programming may come to the broadcast center from content providers (TBS, HBO, CNN, ESPN, etc.) via satellite, fiber optic cable and/or special digital tape. Satellite-delivered programming is typically immediately digitized, encrypted and uplinked to the orbiting satellites. The satellites retransmit the signal to every earth-station&mdash;or, in other words, every compatible DBS system receiver dish at customers&apos; homes and businesses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Some programs may be recorded on digital videotape in the broadcast center to be broadcast later. Before any recorded programs are viewed by customers, technicians may use post-production equipment to view and analyze each tape to ensure audio and video quality. Tapes may then be loaded into a robotic tape handling systems, and playback may be triggered by a computerized signal sent from a broadcast automation system. Back-up videotape playback equipment may ensure uninterrupted transmission at all times. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> While the following description makes particular reference to cable head-ends <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, it should be recognized that satellite broadcast centers may be used for the same purpose. Thus, as used herein, the term &ldquo;broadcast center&rdquo; may refer interchangeably to head-ends <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> or satellite broadcast centers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, there is shown a physical block diagram of an STB <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. As noted above, the STB <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> includes a wireless receiver <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> for receiving control signals and audio/video signals from the wireless transmitter <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> in the hybrid communicator/remote control <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Additionally, the STB <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> includes a wireless transmitter <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> for transmitting audio/video signals to the hybrid communicator/remote control <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The STB <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> also includes, in one implementation, a network interface <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> for communicating with the broadband communication network <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> via the head-end <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The interface <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> may include conventional tuning, demodulating, and demultiplexing circuitry for receiving MPEG (Moving Picture Experts Group) packets corresponding to a selected MPEG channel. The interface <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> may also include conventional data modem circuitry for sending or receiving other types of data. For example, the interface <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> may conform to the DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification) or DAVIC (Digital Audio-Visual Council) cable modem standards. In one embodiment, a CMTS-DRFI (Cable Modem Termination System-Downstream RF Interface) may be used in conjunction with a CMTS-URFI (Cable Modem Termination System-Downstream RF Interface) to establish two-way communication between the STB <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the head-end <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> In one configuration, one or more frequency bands (for example, from 5 to 30 MHz) may be reserved for upstream transmission. Digital modulation (for example, quadrature amplitude modulation or frequency shift keying) may be used to send digital signals in the upstream transmission. Of course, upstream transmission may be accomplished differently for different networks <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. Alternative ways to accomplish upstream transmission include using a back channel transmission, which is typically sent via an analog telephone line, ISDN, DSL, or other techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment in which the STB <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is connected directly to the CO <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, the STB <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> includes standard telephony circuitry <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>.

Preferably, the display component <highlight><bold>532</bold></highlight> may also be configured to permit a user to easily change which portion of the contact list <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> is displayed, if the contact list <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> is longer than can be conveniently displayed on the display screen <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, a user selection component <highlight><bold>534</bold></highlight> allows the user to select a contact <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> from the contact list <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> using the buttons <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Once the user has selected a contact <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>, the address <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> corresponding to the selected contact is preferably obtained from the contact list <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> As previously noted, the user, in one embodiment, may also select a contact verbally, if a verbal identifier <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight> is available for that contact <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>. More specifically, the verbal expression receiving component <highlight><bold>527</bold></highlight> and verbal expression digitizing component <highlight><bold>528</bold></highlight> may be activated to receive a verbal expression <highlight><bold>538</bold></highlight> from the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> The verbal expression <highlight><bold>538</bold></highlight> may be compared, through the use of a comparison component <highlight><bold>539</bold></highlight>, with a verbal identifier <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight> for each contact <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> stored in the contact list <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>. The comparison component <highlight><bold>539</bold></highlight> may be configured, for example, to compare the wavelength, amplitude, tonal patterns, or other aspects of digitized sounds to determine whether the verbal expression <highlight><bold>538</bold></highlight> matches any of the verbal identifiers <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight> within an acceptable degree of tolerance. If one of the verbal identifiers <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight> matches the digitized verbal expression <highlight><bold>538</bold></highlight>, the comparison component <highlight><bold>539</bold></highlight> may designate the contact <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> with the matching verbal identifier <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight> as the selected contact <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> and retrieve the corresponding address <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> The retrieved address <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> may be transmitted by a transmission component <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> to a reception component <highlight><bold>541</bold></highlight> within the STB <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> or another device that performs the function (e.g., an advanced television or the like, as noted previously). After the address <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> is received, a two-way communication channel may be established in different ways, depending on what type of address was received. For example, if the address <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> corresponds to an address <highlight><bold>542</bold></highlight> on the broadband communication network <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, i.e., an interactive television system operated by another user, the STB <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may take the steps necessary to initiate communication via the broadband communication network <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> through the use of a broadband network communication component <highlight><bold>544</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> For example, the broadband communication component <highlight><bold>544</bold></highlight> may be configured to route the communication to the broadband communication network through one of the head-ends <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, to the broadband communication network <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, and then to an STB <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of another interactive television system through the same head-end <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> or a different head-end <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, if the communicating parties do not use the same head-end <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The CO <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, the telephone network <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, and the Internet <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> need not be involved in the communication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> If, however, the address <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> comprises an Internet address <highlight><bold>546</bold></highlight>, such as an IP or MAC address, an Internet communication component <highlight><bold>548</bold></highlight> may be engaged to route the communication appropriately. The Internet communication component <highlight><bold>548</bold></highlight> may route the communication to an Internet-accessible device, such as the devices <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, through the head-end <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, the broadband communication network <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, and the Internet <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The Internet <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> may then route the communication appropriately through the use of its own internal protocols. Communication with Internet-accessible devices may also be routed through the CO <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> for the telephone network <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> If the address <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> comprises an address <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> on the telephone network <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, i.e., a telephone number or the like, a telephone network communication component <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight> may route the communication appropriately. The STB <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may communicate with a device connected to the telephone network <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> by a wired or wireless connection, such as the devices <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> by transmitting the communication directly from the STB <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to the CO <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, and from the CO <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to the telephone network <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. The telephone network <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, by its own internal processes, then routes the communication to the appropriate device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> In alternative embodiments, the STB <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may be configured to route all communication, regardless of the nature of the address <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight>, to a head-end <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> or other intermediate node of the broadband communication network <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the head-end <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> or the other intermediate network node includes the communication components <highlight><bold>544</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>548</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight> necessary to ensure proper routing of the communication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates an alternative configuration of a displayed contact list <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> in which a visual identifier <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight> of a contact <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> is a picture rather than name. The pictures may be digital photographs, drawings, or even icons associated with the contact. For example, the RAM <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> or the ROM <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> may contain a plurality of unassociated icons that the user can select to assign to certain contacts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> The display screen <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> may be configured to show only one of the picture-based visual identifiers <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight> at a time or may show several simultaneously. The visual identifiers <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight> may be arranged in alphabetical order of the contact&apos;s name, in chronological order of date/time of entry into the contact list <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>, or may be arranged in a user-specified order. As depicted, the contact list <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> may display an indication of the relative position of the visual indicator <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight> within the list <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> As with the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the television <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may work in conjunction with, or in some cases, instead of, the display screen <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> to provide the operation of the contact list <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>. For example, the television <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> could be configured to show the pictures <highlight><bold>752</bold></highlight>. If the pictures <highlight><bold>752</bold></highlight> are shown on the display screen <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, the screen <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> may advantageously be a color liquid crystal display (color LCD). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, there is shown an alternative interactive television system <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> according to an embodiment of the invention. The interactive television system <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> may include an STB <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> configured to receive and process audio/video communication and a remote control <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> configured to permit selection of contacts from the contact list <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> More specifically, the STB <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> may include a built-in speaker <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> and microphone <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>. The speaker <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> and microphone <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> may be configured somewhat differently than the speaker and microphone <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, in that they may be specially designed to project and receive sound over greater distances with a comparatively small amount of interference and feedback. Thus, rather than talking into the remote control device, the user may simply talk from a location close enough to the STB <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> for the microphone <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> to capture the user&apos;s voice clearly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> The STB <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> and the remote control <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> may also have wireless transmitters <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> and wireless receivers <highlight><bold>714</bold></highlight>, which may be configured somewhat differently than the transmitters <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and receivers <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. More specifically, the wireless transmitters <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> and the wireless receivers <highlight><bold>714</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> need not transmit or receive a continuous audio/video stream, and may therefore be more simply constructed than the wireless transmitters <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and the wireless receiver <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. For example, the wireless transmitter <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> and/or the wireless receiver <highlight><bold>714</bold></highlight> may be configured to use infrared (IR) frequencies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> In addition or alternative to the speaker <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> and the microphone <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>, the STB <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> may include a headset jack <highlight><bold>760</bold></highlight> configured to receive a plug <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> connected to a headset <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight>, as previously described in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> The remote control <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> thus need not include a speaker and microphone, but may otherwise be configured in the same fashion as the hybrid communicator/remote control <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The remote control <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> allows a user to select a contact from the contact list <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>, after which a two-way communication channel may be established. If desired, the remote control <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> may have a microphone (not shown) to permit vocal selection of a contact from the contact list. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, there is shown a flowchart of a method for creating and using the contact list <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> within the hybrid communicator/remote control <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Initially, the hybrid communicator/remote control <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> may sense <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> user activation of the &ldquo;Add&rdquo; button <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, a list of menu options for adding new contacts to the list may be displayed <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight>. The menu options may correspond with the various components <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight> of the contact entry component <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>. For example, the display screen <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> may display text to query whether the user wishes to add the new contact by manual entry, selection from a displayed list, selection from past or present communication, or receipt from an external device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> The hybrid communicator/remote control <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> may then receive <highlight><bold>806</bold></highlight> a user selection of a method for adding the new contact. The selection may be made through the use of one or more of the user controls <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. After the selection has been received <highlight><bold>806</bold></highlight>, the hybrid communicator/remote control <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> may receive and store <highlight><bold>808</bold></highlight> the data <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight> pertaining to the contact in the contact list <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> When a contact list <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> has been formed, the user can employ the contact list <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> to initiate communication with a contact, for example, by highlighting a desired contact and pressing the &ldquo;Call&rdquo; button <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. The hybrid communicator/remote control <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> may sense <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> user activation of the &ldquo;Call&rdquo; button and display <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> a portion of the contact list <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> on the display screen <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, the hybrid communicator/remote control <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> receives <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight> the user selection of the contact. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Next, the address <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> corresponding to the user selection may be transmitted <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight> to the STB <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to initiate the communication. The STB <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, or some suitable equivalent, may determine <highlight><bold>818</bold></highlight> the location of the address <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight>, i.e., whether the address <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> comprises an address <highlight><bold>542</bold></highlight> on the broadband communication network <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, an address <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> on the Internet <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, or an address <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> on the telephone network <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. The STB <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may then establish <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight> a communication channel with the selected contact via the appropriate network, i.e., the broadband communication network <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, the Internet <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, or the telephone network <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> illustrates an alternative embodiment of the invention in which an STB <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> is configured to substantially reduce unwanted acoustic noise from an audio input signal <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>. In many cases, a near-end user <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> uses a hybrid communicator/remote control <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> in proximity to a television <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to teleconference with a far-end user (not shown). The remote control <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> may capture both the TV sound <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight> and the near-end user&apos;s voice <highlight><bold>909</bold></highlight>. The sound <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight> and the voice <highlight><bold>909</bold></highlight> are combined in the signal <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>. The TV sound <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight> interferes with the voice <highlight><bold>909</bold></highlight> thereby interfering with communication. The far-end user may have difficulty understanding the voice <highlight><bold>909</bold></highlight> of the near-end user <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> when the television sound <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight> is sufficiently loud. Even when the television sound <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight> is quieter than the user&apos;s voice <highlight><bold>909</bold></highlight>, interference caused by the television sound <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight> may be annoying to the far-end user. This may be particularly annoying when the far-end user is viewing the same television program and receives a slightly delayed TV sound <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the STB <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> may operate to cancel or substantially cancel the unwanted television sound <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight> from the audio input <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> to provide a more intelligible audio/video conferencing experience for both users. As shown, a user&apos;s voice <highlight><bold>909</bold></highlight> and television sound <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight> may be simultaneously captured by the hybrid communicator/remote control <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to create audio input <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>. In one configuration, the STB <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> produces a filtered audio input signal <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight> by subtracting the television sound <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight> from the audio input <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>. Thus, the far-end user will hear the voice signal <highlight><bold>909</bold></highlight> with the television sound <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight> cancelled or substantially cancelled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the STB <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> may include, in one configuration, a noise cancellation module <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> for canceling unwanted noise (including the television sound <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight>) from the audio input <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> and produce filtered audio input <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight>. The filtered audio input <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight> may then be transmitted to the far-end user during the course of two-way communication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> The television sound <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight> is produced when a television audio output signal <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> is sent from the STB <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> to a speaker of the television <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The television audio output signal <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> is typically received through television programming as part of a broadcast signal. Various factors may affect the acoustic response of the environment to produce the television sound <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight>. For example, there may be echoes created in a particular room that include a time delay between outputting the television audio output <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> and capturing the corresponding television sound <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight> by the microphone <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> of the hybrid communicator/remote control <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. In addition, depending on the surfaces in the environment, more sound may be reflected or more sound may be absorbed. For example, when a room is substantially empty there may be more echo than when the particular room is full of people. These and many other various factors affect the response of the environment which affects what television sound <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight> will be captured by the microphone <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> when a particular television audio output <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> is sent through the television <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> In one configuration, the television audio output <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> is provided to the noise cancellation module <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> in order to estimate the television sound <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight>. This estimate may then be used by the noise cancellation module <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> to remove the television sound <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight> component from the audio input <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> thereby providing a filtered audio input <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, those skilled in the art will appreciate that there are many systems and methods that may be used to cancel noise (e.g., the television sound <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight>) from the audio input <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>. For example, an adaptive filter <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> may be implemented in software and executed on the CPU <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> or in hardware. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that other combinations of hardware and/or software may also be used for the same purpose. For example, a digital signal processor (not shown) may be included within the STB <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> for noise cancellation. In addition, analog systems and techniques may be used to achieve noise cancellation. In still other embodiments, a noise cancellation module <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> may be implemented within the hybrid communicator/remote control <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the adaptive filter <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> receives the television audio output <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> as an estimate of the noise signal (e.g., the television sound <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight>). The adaptive filter <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> then filters the estimated television sound <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight> from the audio input signal <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> to produce the filtered audio input <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the noise cancellation module <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> may include a training module <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight>. The purpose of the training module <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight> is to provide a better estimate to the adaptive filter <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> than simply the television audio output <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight>. As noted above, various environmental factors affect how sound is received. Thus, the television audio output <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> may not provide an adequate estimate for the television sound <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, standard training techniques may be used by the noise cancellation module <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> to estimate the noise path and improve noise cancellation. The training module <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight> may include a noise generator (not shown) to generate noise to be played on the television <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> for training the adaptive filter <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment of the training module <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight>, the noise generator (not shown) may generate white noise to be played by the television <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and received by the microphone <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> of the hybrid communicator/remote control <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> or received by the microphone <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> of the STB <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight>. The noise cancellation module <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> may use the white noise captured by the microphone <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> to train the adaptive filter <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> for noise cancellation. The training time may vary, but in certain embodiments, the training continues until the effectiveness of the noise cancellation has been maximized or substantially maximized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> In some cases, retraining may be required. Depending upon the difference between the acoustics of different rooms, or the position of the near-end user <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> in the room, the noise cancellation module <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> may need to be retrained for the new room or position. Retraining may be automatic (e.g., at periodic intervals) or user-initiated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> Of course, it will be appreciated that the normal television audio output <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> being sent through the television <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may also be used for training. An embodiment of the noise cancellation module <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> may be designed to continually train and adapt to estimate the noise received by the microphone <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> of the hybrid communicator/remote control <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Of course, a microphone <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> on the STB <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> or as part of an attached peripheral may also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, there is shown a flowchart of one method <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> of operation of the STB <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> that includes the noise cancellation module <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight>. Initially, the adaptive filter <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> may be trained <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight> for acoustic noise cancellation. The training may continue <highlight><bold>1204</bold></highlight> until a satisfactory performance by the noise cancellation module <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> is achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> The television audio output <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> is provided <highlight><bold>1206</bold></highlight> to the adaptive filter <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> as an input. The adaptive filter <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> uses the input to generate <highlight><bold>1208</bold></highlight> an estimate of the acoustic noise (e.g., the television sound <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight>) that will be present at the microphone input. Speech and acoustic noise, including the television sound <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight>, are picked up <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight> (or captured) by the microphone <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>. The estimate of the acoustic noise is then subtracted <highlight><bold>1212</bold></highlight> from the audio input <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> captured by the microphone <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>. As a result, the filtered audio input <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight> is available <highlight><bold>1214</bold></highlight> for transmission or for other use. If the noise cancellation module <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> is still needed, the adaptive filter <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> may continue <highlight><bold>1216</bold></highlight> to operate to cancel noise from the input signal <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, there is shown yet another alternative STB <highlight><bold>1302</bold></highlight> including an output suppression module <highlight><bold>1304</bold></highlight>. The output suppression module <highlight><bold>1304</bold></highlight> may be used to suppress the television sound <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight> or the television audio output <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> when audio input <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> including the near-end user&apos;s voice <highlight><bold>909</bold></highlight> is received by the STB <highlight><bold>1302</bold></highlight>, e.g. via the wireless receiver <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> during two-way communication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, the television sound <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight> is related to the television audio output <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> in that the television audio output <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> is the signal or data sent to the television <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> for output to the user. The television sound <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight> is the sound that is created by the television audio output <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> being output and by the acoustic response characteristics of the environment. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the sound of the television may be muted, attenuated, or blocked by either suppressing the television audio output <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> before it gets to the television <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> or by muting the television <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> speaker or audio system. Thus, as used herein, suppressing the television audio output <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> and muting the television <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> or television audio system are used interchangeably herein and both refer to when no sound is output to produce any television sound <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> When audio input <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> that includes the near-end user&apos;s voice <highlight><bold>909</bold></highlight> is detected, the module <highlight><bold>1304</bold></highlight> effectively mutes the television <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to reduce interference with capturing audio input <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>. The muting of the television <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may be stopped once capture of the audio input <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> including voice <highlight><bold>909</bold></highlight> is terminated, e.g., after the communication is completed. Various methods and/or standard circuits may be used to reduce the volume of, or terminate, the television audio output <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight>, which are well known to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> The output suppression module <highlight><bold>1304</bold></highlight> may be coupled to the wireless receiver <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and/or the CPU <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> (not shown) in order to determine whether audio input <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> is being received by the hybrid communicator/remote control <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. For example, when a two-way audio connection is established, the CPU <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> may signal the output suppression module <highlight><bold>1304</bold></highlight> to suppress the television audio output <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the wireless receiver <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> may provide a signal to the output suppression module <highlight><bold>1304</bold></highlight> when audio input <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> is being received. In certain embodiments, the output suppression module <highlight><bold>1304</bold></highlight> may calculate averages over time of the audio input <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> to detect when audio input <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> that includes the user&apos;s voice <highlight><bold>909</bold></highlight> is being received. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> illustrates an embodiment of the output suppression module <highlight><bold>1304</bold></highlight> that includes a voice detection unit <highlight><bold>1402</bold></highlight> and an output selector <highlight><bold>1404</bold></highlight>. The voice detection unit <highlight><bold>1402</bold></highlight> takes as input the signal provided by the wireless receiver <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. The voice detection unit <highlight><bold>1402</bold></highlight> processes this signal to determine whether voice <highlight><bold>909</bold></highlight> or speech is present. If no voice <highlight><bold>909</bold></highlight> is detected, the voice detection unit <highlight><bold>1402</bold></highlight> may cause the output selector <highlight><bold>1404</bold></highlight> to select the television audio output signal <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> to send to the television <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> for output. If voice <highlight><bold>909</bold></highlight> is detected, the voice detection unit <highlight><bold>1402</bold></highlight> may cause the output selector <highlight><bold>1404</bold></highlight> to send no signal or a muted signal to the television <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> for output. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> In alternative embodiments, the output suppression module <highlight><bold>1304</bold></highlight> may be implemented within the remote control <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. In such an embodiment, the remote control <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> may send a wireless command, e.g., IR (infrared) or RF (radio frequency), to the TV <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to mute the volume when audio input <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> is being received or when a two-way audio connection is active. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, there is shown a flowchart of one possible method <highlight><bold>1500</bold></highlight> of operation of the STB <highlight><bold>1302</bold></highlight> that includes the output suppression module <highlight><bold>1304</bold></highlight>. Initially, the voice detection unit <highlight><bold>1402</bold></highlight> may be trained <highlight><bold>1502</bold></highlight> or calibrated to detect when a user is speaking. The hybrid communicator/remote control <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> may include a button for calibration (not shown). The user <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> may push the calibration button (not shown) to indicate when he or she is speaking into the microphone <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>. Of course, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the voice detection unit <highlight><bold>1402</bold></highlight> may also be operated without any training or calibration period. The training or calibration may continue <highlight><bold>1504</bold></highlight> as long as necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> Audio input <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> is picked up <highlight><bold>1506</bold></highlight> or captured by the microphone <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>. The audio input <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> is then provided <highlight><bold>1508</bold></highlight> as input to the voice detection unit <highlight><bold>1402</bold></highlight>. The voice detection unit <highlight><bold>1402</bold></highlight> processes <highlight><bold>1510</bold></highlight> the input(s) to determine whether a voice <highlight><bold>909</bold></highlight> is present. If <highlight><bold>1512</bold></highlight> voice <highlight><bold>909</bold></highlight> is present, the audio output <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> to the television may be suppressed <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>, or the television may be muted. If voice <highlight><bold>909</bold></highlight> is not present, the output suppression module <highlight><bold>1304</bold></highlight> may continue to process inputs waiting for user input. The output suppression module <highlight><bold>1304</bold></highlight> may operate until <highlight><bold>1516</bold></highlight> it is no longer needed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> Based on the foregoing, the present invention offers numerous advantages not available in conventional approaches. For example, the present invention allows a user to teleconference with a far-end user through use of an interactive television system. The far-end user may be reached through television systems, computers and/or other devices connected to different networks, including a broadband communication network, a telephone network, and the Internet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, systems and methods may be used to reduce unwanted noise from the audio signal being sent to the far-end user. The noise reduction may be accomplished through use of a noise cancellation module implemented within an interactive television system. Alternatively, the noise reduction may be achieved through use of an output suppression module. The noise reduction may result in a more pleasant teleconference for the users. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> While specific embodiments and applications of the present invention have been illustrated and described, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the precise configuration and components disclosed herein. Various modifications, changes, and variations which will be apparent to those skilled in the art may be made in the arrangement, operation, and details of the methods and systems of the present invention disclosed herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. </paragraph>
