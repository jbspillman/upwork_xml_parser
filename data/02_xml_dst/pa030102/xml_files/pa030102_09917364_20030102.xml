<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention is related in general to the field of electronic systems and semiconductor devices and more specifically to the structure and etching method of interlevel metal connectors in dual damascene devices using only one photomask step. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The trend in semiconductor technology to double the functional complexity of its products every 18 months (Moore&apos;s &ldquo;law&rdquo;), which is still valid today after having dominated the industry for the last three decades, has several implicit consequences. First, the cost per functional unit should drop with each generation of complexity so that the cost of the product with its doubled functionality would increase only slightly. Second, the higher product complexity should largely be achieved by shrinking the feature sizes of the chip components while holding the package dimensions constant; preferably, even the packages should shrink. Third, the increased functional complexity should be paralleled by an equivalent increase in reliability of the product. And fourth, but not least, the best financial profit rewards were held out for the ones who were ahead in the marketplace in reaching the complexity goal together with offering the most flexible products for application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In order to stay on course with Moore&apos;s law, significant technological changes have been introduced in the semiconductor industry in recent years. Newer dielectric materials such as silicon-containing hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ) are being preferred due to their lower dielectric constant which helps to reduce the capacitance C in the RC time constant and thus allows higher circuit speed. Since the density and porosity of dielectric films affect the dielectric constant through absorption or desorption of water, films with these characteristics are introduced even when they are mechanically weaker. Films made of aerogels, organic polyimides, and parylenes fall into the same category. These materials are less dense and mechanically weaker than previous standard insulators such as the plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposited dielectrics. This trend even affects stacks of dielectric layers such as alternating layers of plasma-generated tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) oxide and HSQ, or ozone TEOS oxide and HSQ. Since these materials are also used under the bond pad metal, they magnify the risk of device failure by cracking. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, copper interconnection has been adapted to silicon integrated circuits due to its low resistance and high electromigration reliability compared to the traditional aluminum interconnection. Single-damascene and dual-damascene methods have been employed for the fabrication of copper interconnection. For multi-level copper interconnects using any of these two methods, improved electromigration reliability, especially improved lifetime of early failures have been reported, for example, in the recent article &ldquo;A High Reliability Copper Dual-Damascene Interconnection with Direct-Contact Via Structure&rdquo; (K. Ueno et al, IEEE Internat. Electron Devices Meeting 2000, December 10-13, pp. 265-268). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In spite of progress such as described in that paper, in known technology many problems still remain related to the copper interconnection concept. For example, the copper traces have to be sealed by barrier layers in order to prevent copper migration into the silicon circuitry where copper atoms are known to offer energy levels for electron recombination/generation, acting as electron life-time killers. The same sealing barriers should protect the porous insulating layers of low dielectric constant (so-called low-k materials) against intruding atoms, which may initiate coalescence of micro-voids into larger voids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In multi-level copper metallization processes, the number of photomask steps required, together with the number of mask alignment steps, increase rapidly. This is especially true for the fabricating interlevel connectors through stacks of low-k insulating layers. The resulting steep cost increase is clearly counterproductive to the goals of Moore&apos;s law. Little effort, however, has been dedicated in known technology to reduce the number of photomask steps. An urgent need has, therefore, arisen for a coherent, low-cost method of reducing the number of required photomask steps, especially for fabricating interlevel connectors, and, simultaneously, improve the degree of component reliability. The fabrication method should be simple, yet flexible enough for different semiconductor product families and a wide spectrum of design and process variations. Preferably, these innovations should be accomplished without extending production cycle time, and using the installed equipment, so that no investment in new manufacturing machines is needed. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The invention describes a method for fabricating circuit interconnects in integrated circuits comprising vertical vias and horizontal trenches between metal lines, wherein only one photomask for creating vias and trenches is needed instead of the conventional two masks. The function of the second mask is replaced by a series of plasma etch steps, which exploit differential etch rates for areas which are open relative to areas which are narrow and constricted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment of the invention, at least one metal line is overlaid by a stack of insulating layers alternating between etch stop and dielectric layers. The method comprises the steps of depositing a layer of photoresist on the uppermost insulating layer of said stack; patterning said photoresist layer to create a plurality of structures, each structure having outer dimensions defining said trenches, and at least one hole in each trench defining said via; adjacent structures spaced at least by the diameter of said via, and aligned so that the open area between said structures is greater than the area of a single via, thereby providing differential plasma etch rates for said insulating layers, wherein the etch rate is approximately 20% greater outside said structures than inside said hole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> As a technical advantage of the invention, each interconnection created by the method of the invention is a structure of wider trenches and narrower vias, wherein the diameter of the vias is approximately the same as the narrowest width of the reverse trench pattern, and each via is centered within the trench. The reverse trench pattern surrounding the via is approximately twice the width of the via diameter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> As a further technical advantage of the invention, each interconnecting structure is spaced from an adjacent structure by at least the width of the vias. This results in a simple design rule for interconnecting structures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the stack of insulating layers comprises four etch stop layers alternating with three dielectric layers. The stop layers are preferably made of silicon carbide in the thickness range from 30 to 150 nm, and the dielectric layers are preferably porous low-k materials in the thickness range from 200 to 400 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The preferential etch for the stop layers comprises a plasma consisting of C4F8, argon and oxygen, at an etch rate between 100 and 200 nm/min. The preferential etch for the porous dielectric layer comprises a plasma consisting of CH3F, argon and nitrogen, at an etch rate of about 750 nm/min. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> It is an aspect of the invention that the method is fully compatible with single damascene and dual damascene process flow and deep sub-micron (0.18 &mgr;m and smaller) technologies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the invention is that it applicable to a wide variety of circuits and process technologies. Examples of semiconductor device families include DRAMs, standard linear and logic products, digital signal processors, microprocessors, digital and analog devices, high frequency and high power devices and both large and small are chip categories. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The preferred metallization is copper; the invention is applicable, however, to a variety of metals. The invention can further be applied to any circuit where metal level-to-level interconnects are presently built with two photomasks and a process reduction to only one mask represents an economical advantage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The technical advances represented by the invention, as well as the aspects thereof, will become apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments of the invention, when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and the novel features set forth in the appended claims. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The present invention is related to U.S. patent application No. 09/863,687, filed on May 23, 2001 (Jiang, &ldquo;Method for Sealing Via Sidewalls in Porous Low-k Dielectric Layers&rdquo;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Single-damascene and dual-damascene processes have been used to fabricate copper interconnections. This invention applies to dual-damascene technologies. The dual-damascene technology has the advantage of reducing process steps which leads to lower cost. It is, therefore, chosen as the vehicle to describe the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a schematic representation of a dual-damascene interlevel structure, generally designated <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, as preferred for the fabrication of interconnectors and the second metal level. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is generic and not to scale. <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is the first horizontal metal level, preferably copper. The metal layer is on an insulator on the surface of a semiconductor substrate used for fabricating an integrated circuit. The semiconductor does not necessarily have to be silicon (n-type or p-type), but may be silicon germanium, gallium arsenide or another III-V compound, or another compound material used in semiconductor device manufacturing. The metal level is already patterned into a plurality of individual metal lines, so <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> may be one of those metal lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> As defined herein, expressions with geometrical connotations like &ldquo;over&rdquo;, &ldquo;on top&rdquo;, &ldquo;overlaid&rdquo;, are relative expressions and refer to the surface of the semiconductor substrate as line (or plane) of origin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Over the horizontal metal line <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is a vertical stack of horizontal insulating layers. Directly over metal line <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is the first etch stop layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. It is between 30 and 150 nm thick and selected from a group of materials consisting of silicon carbide, silicon carbon nitride, and silicon nitride. In the embodiment described below, the preferred choice is silicon carbide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Over stop layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is the first dielectric layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. Preferably it is between 200 and 400 nm thick and made of a material having a dielectric constant less than 3.9 (&ldquo;low-k&rdquo; dielectric) and contains silicon, oxygen and carbon, and pores with an average diameter of 5 nm, 100% connected. Commercially materials are available under the brand name XLK 2.2 by Dow Corning, USA, or LKD 5109 by JSR, Japan. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> First dielectric layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is overlaid by the second etch stop layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, preferably made of silicon carbide. For easier control of the etch processes to be described, layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is preferably made slightly thicker than the other stop layers of stack <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Over stop layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is the second dielectric layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, made of low-k material in the thickness range 200 to 400 nm. Second dielectric layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is overlaid by the third etch stop layer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, in the 30 to 150 nm thickness range and preferably made of silicon carbide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Over the third stop layer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is the third dielectric layer <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, made of low-k material in the thickness range 200 to 400 nm. Over the third dielectric layer is the fourth etch stop layer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, preferably made of silicon carbide in the thickness range 30 to 150 nm. Stop layer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is the top layer of the insulating stack. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a structure <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>, patterned from a photoresist layer deposited on the top stop layer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. The shape and function of this structure, as it relates to the fabrication of metal interconnects between metal line <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and the following metal level according to the invention, is described in more detail below. The patterned photoresist structure <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> contains a via <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, outlined by the dashed contours in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a schematic top view of a simple embodiment of a patterned photoresist structure <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> suitable for creating a trench pattern with a via <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. It should be pointed out that this reverse trench pattern photoresist <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> contains the via <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> in a centered position. After completing the processing, via <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> will be filled with metal and will thus provide electrical connection to the underlying metal line <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> A more elaborate plurality of reverse trench pattern photoresist structures is depicted in the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>. Each structure consists of a trench pattern <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> with a via <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> centered within the trench. When filled with metal, one or more vias will establish electrical connection to an underlying metal line <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>. A variation of this plurality of photoresist structures is depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference>. Again, the reverse trench pattern photoresist structures determine the extension of the trenches <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> and the position of the centered vias <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> for the connection to the underlying metal lines <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

Both figures are microphotographs of cross sections through etch pits in SiC layers; the units in both x and y directions are nanometers. The pits have been created by exposing the SiC to a plasma etch in a mixture of C4F8, Ar and O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(preferred ratios 1:50:8, respectively; ratios are variable; gas flow rates:Ar 600 standard cubic centimeter, O2 100, C4F8 12; when averaged over various pit diameters, the SiC etch rate is about 120 nm/min). The exposure time was equal for the pit arrangements in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</cross-reference>. The significant difference between the pits in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</cross-reference> is that the pits in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> have a diameter <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> of 250 nm, while the pit in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> has a diameter <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> of 600 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In equal time and plasma condition, the etch reaches a depth <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> of 196 nm in the 600 nm wide pit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>B, while it reaches only a depth <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> of 158.6 nm in the 250 nm wide pits of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>. Consequently, the wider pit etches 24% faster than the narrower pits. Repeated experiments showed an etch variation between 22% and 24%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Based on these etch differences, the layout rules for a plurality of reverse trench pattern photoresist structures, each structure having at least one centered via, are as follows (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>): </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Adjacent trench structures are spaced at least by the diameter of the via, and aligned so that the open (horizontal) area <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> between the adjacent structures is greater than the cross sectional area <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> of a single via; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> the width of the resist surrounding the via should be at least R, when the diameter of the via is 2R. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> (For example: For 2R&equals;180 nm, R should be at least 90 nm. R may be selected between 50 and 100 nm). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The layout of the plurality of reverse trench pattern photoresist structures <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is an example illustrating an embodiment of the above rules. In this example, each trench structure <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> has two vias <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> and is spaced from the adjacent trench structure at least by the diameter <highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight> of the via. Consequently, in an arrangement as shown by the example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the plasma etch rates for SiC within the vias will be more than 20% smaller than the etch rate between the structures. This etch rate difference is exploited by the process flow of the present invention. </paragraph>
