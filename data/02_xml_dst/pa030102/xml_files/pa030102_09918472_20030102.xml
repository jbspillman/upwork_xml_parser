<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to a cloth, and more particularly to a laminated cloth having a compressibility. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The conventional compressible composite cloth is generally formed by three modes. The one mode includes a knitted cloth which is attached with a foam elastic thin sheet. The elastic thin sheet is made of various materials, such as artificial sponge, EVA copolymer, natural rubber, synthetic rubber, etc. The elastic thin sheet serves to provide an elasticity against the compression. The artificial sponge is susceptible to deteriorating and aging. The EVA or rubber material is not permeable to air and is devoid of an excellent softness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The second mode involves a sandwich compressible composite cloth which is integrally made by warping. This structure is relatively less susceptible to deteriorating and aging and is permeable to air. In addition, this structure has a better textural strength. However, this structure is less cost-effective in view of the fact that it is made by warping. In addition, the product selectivity is often limited by the warping of threads due to the fact that the shape and the pattern of the product are limited by the warping of threads. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Another kind involves the use of a knitted fabric layer which is provided thereon with a fiber support layer slightly perpendicular to the knitted fabric layer. The fiber support layer is provided thereon with another knitted fabric layer. The support layer is intended to provide an elasticity against compression. This structure is relatively more cost-effective and is less limited in formation of texture shape and pattern of the product. The production involves the pressing, thereby making the product vulnerable to stripping, as compared with the product which is made integrally. The cloth of this kind of structure is used as a filler. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The primary objective of the present invention is to provide a laminated cloth which has a compressibility and is permeable to air. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In keeping with the principle of the present invention, the foregoing objective of the present invention is attained by a compressible laminated cloth having a fabric main body comprising a first sheet layer, a second sheet layer, and a support layer sandwiched between the first sheet layer and the second sheet layer. The first sheet layer, the support layer, and the second sheet layer are integrally made by woofing. The fabric main body is provided on the surface with an outer sheet layer attached thereto by an adhesive.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> As shown in all drawings provided herewith, a compressible laminated cloth of the present invention comprises a fabric main body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and an outer sheet layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The fabric main body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a first sheet layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a second sheet layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and a support layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> sandwiched between the first sheet layer <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and the second sheet layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The first sheet layer, the support layer, and the second sheet layer are integrally made by knitting. The preferred embodiment of the present invention is integrally made by woofing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The outer sheet layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is a cloth made of any material, or a sheet product of plastic or rubber. The outer sheet layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is adhered to the surface of the fabric main body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. According to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the outer sheet layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is attached to the surface of the fabric main body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by a plurality of irregular adhesive dots. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The fabric main body of the present invention is made by woofing and is therefore more cost-effective than the conventional fabric which is made by warping. However, the present invention is weaker in textural strength than the conventional fabric. In spite of this disadvantage, the present invention is less susceptible to deteriorating and aging than the foam material. Moreover, the sandwich structure of the present invention is not vulnerable to peeling. The present invention allows a greater versatility in design. </paragraph>
