<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A clutch specially adapted for a screw gun includes an output clutch and a driving clutch. The output clutch is movable axially to engage the driving clutch. A helical spline arrangement on the driving clutch causes the driving clutch to move axially towards the output clutch a short distance when torque is transferred through the clutch. When the clutch slips and the torque is released, the driving clutch moves axially away from the output clutch a short distance and a gap is created between the output clutch and driving clutch which prevents clashing. Also, a retaining ring is mounted to an input spindle to limit the axial movement of the driving clutch. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The field of this invention is clutches and more particularly clutches for screw guns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The prior art includes several examples of positive disengagement clutches, or &ldquo;quiet&rdquo; clutches. Generally, these clutches include some mechanism for moving one of the clutch surfaces away from the other clutch surface when they disengage in order to prevent the clutch surfaces from clashing against one another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,655,103, 4,809,572, and 4,947,714 are three examples each disclosing a quiet clutch for a screw gun. The &apos;714 patent discloses a clutch with three clutching elements&mdash;a drive element, an intermediate element, and an output element. To drive a screw, all three clutch elements are initially engaged with one another (see FIG. 2 of the &apos;714 patent). At some point while driving the screw, torque causes the intermediate element and the output element to separate from each other due to the cam surfaces 30, 15 (see FIG. 3 of the &apos;714 patent). When the screw is almost driven to its intended depth, the intermediate element and the output element slide axially forward away from the input element, following the screw into the work piece (see FIG. 4 of the &apos;714 patent). When the screw reaches its intended depth, the input element and the intermediate element slip. Once the slip occurs, the torque is released and the separation between the output element and the intermediate element caused by the torque and the cam surfaces 30 and 15 is no longer present. A spring positioned between the input element and the intermediate element returns the intermediate element back together with the output element. This return creates a gap &ldquo;s&rdquo; between the input element and the intermediate element (see FIG. 5 of the &apos;714 patent). The gap prevents clashing of the clutch surfaces during disengagement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> While the clutch described in the &apos;714 patent prevents clashing of the clutch surfaces during disengagement, the contact area between the intermediate element and the output element in the &apos;714 patent decreases as the intermediate element moves away from the output element. This decrease in the contact area leads to an additional increase in the stress which arises on the intermediate element and the output element from the transfer of torque from one to the other. The increased stress can lead to a decrease in the fatigue life of each part. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is a feature of the present invention to provide a clutch which prevents clashing of the clutch surfaces during disengagement and which is also simple and inexpensive. It is also a feature of the invention to provide a retaining ring which extends circumferentially around a first spindle in a clutch to limit the movement of a first clutch supported on the first spindle for axial and rotational movement relative thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment of the invention, a screw gun comprises a drive means, a first spindle having a first helical spline formed on a portion thereof, a first clutch having a second helical spline formed on a portion thereof so that the second helical spline engages the first helical spline of the first spindle, the first clutch being movable rotationally and axially relative to the first spindle, and a second spindle, one of the first spindle or the second spindle being driven by the drive means. A bit adapted for driving a fastener into a work piece is operatively connected to the other of the first spindle or the second spindle. A second clutch is mounted on the second spindle and rotationally fixed relative to the second spindle, the second clutch being movable in an axial direction relative to the first spindle to engage the first clutch, torque being transmittable between the first clutch and the second clutch upon engagement with one another. A spring biases the first clutch and the second clutch apart. When torque is being transmitted to the fastener in at least one direction, an axial reaction force is created between the first and second helical splines which moves the first clutch axially towards the second clutch causing the first clutch to rotate relative to the first spindle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the invention, a clutch comprises a first spindle having a first complementary engaging surface formed on an exterior cylindrical surface thereof, a first clutch having a second complementary engaging surface formed on an interior bore thereof, the first clutch supported on the first spindle at the interior bore for rotational and axial movement relative to the first spindle, with the first and second complementary engaging surfaces in engagement, and a second spindle, one of the first spindle or the second spindle being adapted to be driven by a drive means. A second clutch is mounted on the second spindle and rotationally fixed relative to the second spindle, the second clutch being movable in an axial direction relative to the first spindle to engage the first clutch, and torque being transmittable between the first clutch and the second clutch upon engagement with one another. A spring biases the first clutch and the second clutch apart. When torque is being transmitted between the first spindle and the first clutch in at least one direction, an axial reaction force is created between the first and second complementary engaging surfaces which moves the first clutch axially towards the second clutch causing the first clutch to rotate relative to the input spindle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the invention, a method of driving a fastener comprises the steps of pushing a fastener against a work piece with a screw gun which causes a first clutch and a second clutch to engage, driving the fastener into the work piece by transferring torque between the first clutch and the second clutch and then to the fastener, causing the torque which is being transferred between the first clutch and the second clutch to act upon helical splines positioned between the first clutch and a first spindle creating an axial reaction force, the axial reaction force in turn creating a small clearance distance between the first clutch and the first spindle, and disengaging the first clutch and the second clutch when the fastener is driven to the desired depth while simultaneously removing the first clearance distance between the first clutch and the first spindle and creating a second clearance distance between the first clutch and the second clutch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the invention, a clutch for a screw gun comprises a first spindle, a first clutch supported on the first spindle for rotational and axial movement relative thereto, and a second spindle, one of the first spindle or the second spindle being adapted to be driven by a drive means, the other of the first spindle or the second spindle being adapted to drive a fastener. A second clutch is attached to the second spindle for rotation therewith, the second clutch adapted to engage the first clutch and transfer torque. A retaining ring extends circumferentially around the first spindle, the retaining ring abutting a surface of the first clutch when the first clutch moves axially on the first spindle wherein the axial movement of the first clutch relative to the first spindle is limited by the retaining ring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> These and other objects, features and advantages of the invention are apparent through the detailed description of the preferred embodiments and the drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, the clutch includes a driving clutch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and an output clutch <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The driving clutch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and output clutch <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> are configured with mating surfaces, such as mating teeth, so that when they are engaged they are capable of transmitting torque one to another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> An input spindle <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is driven by a driving means housed in the tool, such as an electric motor or the like. Bearing <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> supports input spindle <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> so that it can rotate relative to the tool housing. Input spindle <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and driving clutch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> engage one another through a helical spline assembly, as will be described in detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Output spindle <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> includes an end <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> into which a bit driver <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> is detachably mounted. A bit <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> adapted for driving a screw or some other fastener is in turn detachably mounted into bit driver <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>. Another end <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> of the output spindle <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is journaled with a sliding fit inside of a bore <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> formed in the input spindle <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. The sliding fit allows output spindle <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> to rotate and freely slide axially in bore <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. The output clutch <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is fixed to and rotates with output spindle <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. While output clutch <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> preferably does not slide axially any appreciable amount relative to the output spindle <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, it may slide axially together with output spindle <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> A compression spring <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> biases the output clutch <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and the output spindle <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> apart from the driving clutch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The respective ends of compression spring <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> push against the driving clutch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, or an optional thrust washer <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, and the output clutch <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, the input spindle <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and the driving clutch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are illustrated, respectively. The input spindle <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and the driving clutch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> engage one another through a helical spline assembly. The driving clutch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> has helical splines <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> formed on its interior bore <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. The input spindle <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> has corresponding helical splines <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> formed on an exterior cylindrical surface <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. The helical splines <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> are sized to mesh with one another in a manner similar to the meshing of threads on a nut and bolt. When the driver is operated in the forward direction to drive a fastener, torque is transferred from the input spindle <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> to the driving clutch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The force at the helical splines <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> caused by the torque creates an axial reaction force tending to push the driving clutch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> axially away from the input spindle <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. When the driving clutch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> moves axially away from the input spindle <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, the driving clutch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> also rotates a few degrees relative to the input spindle <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. The axial movement of the driving clutch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> relative to the input spindle <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> can be limited by a retaining ring <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) or other structure. Thrust washer <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is optionally provided in one embodiment to ride against an annular surface <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) of the driving clutch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to distribute the load from the driving clutch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to the retaining ring <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Besides the illustrated helical spline assembly, the engagement between the input spindle <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and the driving clutch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be through any arrangement including complementary engaging surfaces formed on the input spindle <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and the driving clutch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> where the transfer of torque from one to the other causes an axial reaction force between the input spindle <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and the driving clutch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, and where the complementary engaging surfaces are formed on the exterior cylindrical surface <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> of the input spindle and on the interior bore <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> of the driving clutch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> For example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> illustrates an alternative preferred embodiment where the input spindle <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>includes a square-sectioned, helically twisted engaging surface <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>formed on its exterior cylindrical surface <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The surface <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is complementary with and engages a similarly square-sectioned, helically twisted engaging surface <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>formed on the interior bore <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of driving clutch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. As with the input spindle <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and the driving clutch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, when the input spindle <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>transfers torque in a forward direction to the driving clutch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, an axial reaction force is created tending to push the driving clutch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>away from the input spindle <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> One advantage of such an arrangement is that the contact area between the input spindle <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and the driving clutch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> remains substantially constant. Even though the driving clutch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> moves away from the input spindle <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, the contact area does not decrease. Thus, the pressure on the contact area which arises during torque transfer does not increase due to a decrease in the contact area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The helical splines <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> on the driving clutch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and the input spindle <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> can be machined. Alternatively, they may be formed in a metal injection molding, powder metal forming, or investment casting operation. The helix angle of each of the splines (measured from a plane parallel to the axis of the input spindle) is preferably between about 45&deg; and 75&deg;, and more preferably between about 55&deg; and 65&deg;, and most preferably about 60&deg;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In one further preferred embodiment, the driving clutch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and the output clutch <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> are formed from a carburizing grade steel. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Operation </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Two modes of operation of the clutch will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In the first mode of operation, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> depicts the clutch in a disengaged state, and it will be assumed that the drive means of the tool is not yet activated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the user pushes the bit <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> and a screw or other fastener against a work piece W. This pushing force is transferred from the screw gun to the input spindle <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, to the driving clutch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, to the thrust washer <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and spring <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. This pushing force is also transferred from the spring <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> to the output clutch <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, output spindle <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, bit holder <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>, bit <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> and finally to the screw. The pushing force compresses spring <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>, causing output spindle <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and output clutch <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to slide axially closer to the driving clutch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and input spindle <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. Eventually, when the pushing force is great enough, the driving clutch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and the output clutch <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> begin to engage. When the driving clutch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and output clutch <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> begin to engage, they are ready to transfer torque. When the driving clutch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and the output clutch <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> are fully engaged, the pushing force is directly transferred between them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> When the driving means is activated, torque is applied to the input spindle <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and in turn is transferred to the driving clutch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the output clutch <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the output spindle <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, the bit holder <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>, the bit <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> and finally to the screw, rotating each of these components together. The screw is thereby driven into the work piece W. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, at some point while driving the screw, the torque transferred through the input spindle <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and driving clutch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> becomes great enough that the reaction force resulting from the torque on the helical splines <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> causes driving clutch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to rotate slightly relative to the input spindle <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and move axially away from the input spindle <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> by a small distance D, until the driving clutch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and the thrust washer <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) abut retaining ring <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). This movement of the driving clutch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> also causes the output clutch <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, output spindle <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, bit holder <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> and bit <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> to slide axially forward a small amount. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Eventually the screw is driven to a predetermined depth and an end of the nosepiece <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> abuts the work piece W, as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>. The user&apos;s pushing force against the screw gun is then transferred through the nosepiece <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> to the work piece W, and no longer through the clutch. With the user&apos;s pushing force no longer fully compressing spring <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>, the output spindle <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and the output clutch <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> are pushed axially away from the driving clutch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and input spindle <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> as the screw is driven further into the work piece W. In one embodiment, the output spindle <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and the output clutch <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> are pushed axially away from the driving clutch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and input spindle <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> by a reaction force created at the surface of sloped mating teeth formed on the mating surfaces of each of the output clutch <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and driving clutch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. As output clutch <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> moves axially away from the driving clutch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, it begins to disengage from driving clutch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Eventually, the mating surfaces of output clutch <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> move just beyond the mating surfaces of driving clutch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and they slip and disengage. At the instant they slip, the torque transmitted from the input spindle <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> to the driving clutch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is released. When the torque is released, the reaction force from the helical splines <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> which pushes the driving clutch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> axially away from the input spindle <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is also released. Once this reaction force is released, spring <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> pushes the thrust washer <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and the driving clutch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> back into their original positions relative to input spindle <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> so that there is no longer a distance D separating them. This motion also moves driving clutch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> axially away from the output clutch <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, creating a new clearance distance D between the two output clutch <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and the input clutch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. This clearance distance D ensures a clean disengagement of the clutch and reduces clashing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In the second mode of operation, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> depicts the clutch in a disengaged state, and it will be assumed that the drive means of the tool is already activated. This mode of operation is commonly employed by tradesmen who lock the screw gun in its &ldquo;ON&rdquo; position during continuous use for driving one fastener after another in rapid succession. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> When the user pushes a screw against a work piece W with the screw gun, as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, output clutch <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> moves toward engagement with driving clutch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, as in the first mode. Since the drive means is already activated, input spindle <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and driving clutch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are already rotating. As soon as driving clutch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and output clutch <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> begin to engage, output clutch <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and output spindle <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> immediately begin to rotate along with driving clutch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and input spindle <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and the screw is driven into work piece W. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> As in the first mode, at some point while driving the screw, the torque transferred through the input spindle <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and driving clutch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> becomes great enough that the reaction force resulting from the torque on the helical splines <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> causes driving clutch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to move away from input spindle <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> by a small distance D, as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. From this point forward, the clutch will continue to operate as described in the first mode until the clutch disengages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Besides simplicity, this design includes other advantages not present in the prior art. For example, the retaining ring <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, is advantageously placed on the input spindle <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> so that at the time when the driving clutch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and thrust washer <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> contact retaining ring <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>, the retaining ring <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> rotates at the same speed as driving clutch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. In the design disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,538,089, an annular projecting shoulder <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> (see FIG. 1 of the &apos;089 patent) is formed in the clutch housing and bears against annular shoulder <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> on the intermediate clutch. The projecting shoulder <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> stops the forward axial movement of the intermediate clutch, but also causes friction as the clutch housing does not rotate and the intermediate clutch rotates at a high speed. The disclosure suggests that a journal bearing <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> can be placed between the projecting shoulders <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, but heat and wear are nevertheless created by the friction resulting from the contact. Retaining ring <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> disclosed herein produces substantially no heat or wear. Retaining ring <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> must be able to withstand the axial force placed upon it by the driving clutch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. To this end, two alternative embodiments are proposed in FIGS. <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> which may provide an increased fatigue life for the clutch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>B illustrate a preferred embodiment which includes a first alternative to retaining ring <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>: a nut <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Nut <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is threaded on its inside diameter. The outside diameter of the input spindle <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> has complementary threads in this embodiment so that nut <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is held onto input spindle <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> with a threaded connection. The threaded connection provides additional strength to keep nut <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>securely positioned on the input spindle <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> during the life of the tool. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>B illustrate a preferred embodiment which includes a second alternative to retaining ring <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>: a flange <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>on a stud <highlight><bold>341</bold></highlight>. One end of stud <highlight><bold>341</bold></highlight> is sized to fit inside of bore <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> of input spindle <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. Bore <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> has threads formed therein and one end of stud <highlight><bold>341</bold></highlight> has complementary threads which engage the threads of bore <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> to form a threaded connection between input spindle <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and stud <highlight><bold>341</bold></highlight>. Flange <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is formed as an annular shoulder on the other end of stud <highlight><bold>341</bold></highlight> opposite the threaded end. In this embodiment, output spindle <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> would be formed with a bore in one end sized so that stud <highlight><bold>341</bold></highlight> can be journaled in the bore and the output spindle <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> can be rotationally supported by stud <highlight><bold>341</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Thus an improved clutch for a screw gun has been disclosed which disengages quietly with reduced clashing, is simple and inexpensive, and has a good fatigue life. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Although the invention has been described in relation to certain preferred embodiments, the invention is not limited to these embodiments. Many possible variations of this clutch may be realized without departing from the scope of the invention as defined by the claims. For example, in lieu of the helical spline arrangement between the input spindle <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and the driving clutch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the output clutch <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may be connected to the output spindle <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> through a helical spline. Such an arrangement would be essentially a reversal of the arrangement illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Other alternatives are within the scope of the preferred embodiments and shall be regarded as equivalents. </paragraph>
