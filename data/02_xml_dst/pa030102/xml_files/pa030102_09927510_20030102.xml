<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a composition for the oxidation dyeing of keratinous fibers, such as human keratinous fibers for example hair, comprising, in a medium suitable for dyeing: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> (a) at least one oxidation dye, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> (b) at least one cationic amphiphilic polymer comprising at least one fatty chain, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> (c) a combination comprising: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> (I) at least one compound chosen from oxyalkylenated fatty alcohols and glycerolated fatty alcohols, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> (II) at least one hydroxylated solvent, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> wherein the weight ratio of (I) to (II) is greater than 1:1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is known to dye keratinous fibers, such as human hair, with dyeing compositions comprising oxidation dyes, such as, oxidation dye precursors (for example, ortho-phenylenediamines, para-phenylenediamines, ortho-aminophenols, para-aminophenols, and heterocyclic bases generally called oxidation bases). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The oxidation dye precursors, or oxidation bases, are colorless or weakly colored compounds. When these compounds are combined with oxidizing products, dyes and colored compounds may form by a process of oxidative condensation of the oxidation bases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It is also known that the shades obtained with these oxidation bases can be varied by combining them with couplers or color modifiers, the latter may be chosen from aromatic meta-diamines, meta-aminophenols, meta-diphenols and certain heterocyclic compounds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The variety of molecules used in oxidation dyes (oxidation bases and couplers), allows a rich palette of colors to be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Upon application of the oxidation dye product to hair, it is desirable to localize the oxidation dye product correctly so that the dye product does not run down the face or outside of the areas intended to be dyed. It is also desirable to obtain a uniform and even coloration over the entire head of hair. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> It is also desirable for the compositions containing oxidation dyes to be stable over time such as for example, rheologically stable, before the oxidation dye composition is mixed with an oxidizing agent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> European patent application No. 0 943 320 discloses formulations for oxidation dye products which include cationic associative polymers chosen from quaternized celluloses and hydroxyethylcelluloses comprising at least one fatty chain in order to obtain the above-mentioned properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In addition to at least one of the good qualities offered by the dye compositions disclosed in European patent application No. 0 943 320, the dye composition may also exhibit at least one of the following properties: intense and chromatic (luminous) colorations, low selectivity, exhibit good fastness (resistance) towards external agents, for example, chemical agents (shampoo, and permanent-waving products) and natural agents (light, perspiration) giving hair good cosmetic properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Nevertheless, the inventors have found that the color obtained by combining the oxidation dye composition and the oxidizing agent composition may develop too quickly. For example, the color may darken very quickly during the time that the mixture is left on the hair, which may indicate a premature oxidation of the dyes, resulting in a disruption of the dyeing and the development of an aesthetic problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> However, after considerable research, the inventors have discovered that the addition of a combination of materials, as described below, into a composition that combines an oxidation dyeing composition and at least one oxidizing agent, develops in color much less quickly, thus reducing the premature oxidation of the oxidation dyes. This discovery forms one aspect of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> One embodiment of the present invention is a composition for the oxidation dyeing of keratinous fibers, for example human keratinous fibers such as hair, comprising, in a medium suitable for dyeing: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> (a) at least one oxidation dye, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> (b) at least one cationic amphiphilic polymer comprising at least one fatty chain, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> (c) a combination comprising: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> (I) at least one compound chosen from oxyalkylenated fatty alcohols and glycerolated fatty alcohols, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> (II) at least one hydroxylated solvent having a molecular weight of less than 250, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> wherein the weight ratio of (I) to (II) is greater than 1:1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment of the invention relates to a ready-to-use composition for the oxidation dyeing of keratinous fibers, for example human keratinous fibers such as hair, comprising, in a medium suitable for dyeing: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> (a) at least one oxidation dye, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> (b) at least one cationic amphiphilic polymer comprising at least one fatty chain, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> (c) a combination comprising: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> (I) at least one compound chosen from oxyalkylenated fatty alcohols and glycerolated fatty alcohols, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> (II) at least one hydroxylated solvent having a molecular weight of less than 250, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> wherein the weight ratio of (I) to (II) is greater than 1:1; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> (d) at least one oxidizing agent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> For the purposes of the invention, the expression &ldquo;ready-to-use composition&rdquo; is understood to mean any composition intended to be applied immediately to the keratinous fibers; either applied as stored before use or obtained from combining two or more compositions and applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment of the invention is a process for dyeing keratinous fibers, for example, keratinous fibers such as hair, comprising: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> (1) storing a composition (A) comprising, in a medium suitable for dyeing: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> (I) at least one compound chosen from oxyalkylenated fatty alcohols and glycerolated fatty alcohols, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> (II) at least one hydroxylated solvent having a molecular weight of less than 250, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> wherein the weight ratio of (I) to (II) is greater than 1:1; </paragraph>
