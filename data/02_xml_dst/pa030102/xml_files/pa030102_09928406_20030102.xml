<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a lithium secondary battery and, more particularly, to a lithium secondary battery having improved overcharge characteristics as well as an electrical appliance utilizing the lithium secondary battery. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DISCUSSION OF THE RELATED ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The rapid diffusion of portable electronic machines or appliances has created a demand for smaller and lighter batteries as their power source. Primary batteries that meet this demand are lithium primary cells having an anode of lithium metal which are small is size and light in weight and yet have a high capacity. Unfortunately, they cannot be used repeatedly by charging and hence they are limited in use. Secondary batteries such as lead batteries, nickel-cadmium batteries, and nickel-hydrogen batteries can be used repeatedly, but they are low in operating voltage because they rely on an aqueous electrolytic solution. Therefore, they are not suitable for use which requires high capacity, small size, and light weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Demand for a secondary battery having a high capacity, small size, and light weight has been met by the development of a practical lithium ion battery. It has found widespread use in portable electronic and communications machines and equipment, such as CAM coder, digital camera, cellular phone, and notebook computer. It has also found as a power source for hybrid cars and pure electric cars. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A lithium ion battery is characterized by its anode and cathode active materials made of a substance capable of occluding and releasing lithium ions. In principle, it works without requiring electrodeposition of lithium metal. Its anode and cathode may be made of a variety of substances capable of occluding and releasing lithium ions. Their combination permits one to design the battery capacity and working voltage as desired. For example, the cathode is practically made of a carbonaceous material. It is expected to be made of a Group IVA element or an oxide thereof, a lithium-transition metal composite nitride, or an organic compound such as polyacetylene. The anode is practically made of LiMn<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>or LiCoO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and will be made of LiNiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, LiFeO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, or LiMnO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>under developmental stage. A lithium ion battery formed from the above-mentioned anode active material and a carbonaceous material for the cathode undergoes charging by the following mechanism. The anode permits lithium to dissolve in an electrolytic solution composed of an organic solvent and a lithium salt (as en electrolyte) dissolved therein. The cathode (which is separated from the anode by a fine porous separator) causes the carbonaceous material to occlude (by intercalation) lithium ions from the electrolytic solution. Discharging proceeds in the reverse process, thereby delivering electrons to the external circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The above-mentioned lithium ion battery has a designed battery capacity which is determined by the amount of lithium in the anode or the capacity of the cathode occluding lithium ions, whichever smaller. Charging in excess of this battery capacity is referred to as overcharging. In the overcharging state, the anode releases more lithium than it should keep, causing the active material to disintegrate, and the cathode receives excess lithium ions, causing lithium metal to separate out (a phenomenon called dendrite). This results in the battery increasing in voltage and temperature. Thus, overcharging of lithium batteries poses a problem with battery safety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> To address this problem, there has been proposed a method of inhibiting overcharging by causing the electrolytic solution to consume current when overcharging occurs. See, for example, Japanese Patent Laid-open Nos. 338347/1994, 302614/1995, 106835/1997, 17447/1994, 50822/1997, and 162512/1999. The proposed method consists of incorporating the electrolytic solution with an aromatic compound which has an oxidation potential which is higher than the anode potential (usually 4.1-4.3 V) at the time of charging. The object is achieved as the aromatic compound undergoes oxidation reaction, thereby consuming overcharging current and inhibiting reactions due to overcharging. This action is attributable to the oxidation reduction reaction of the &pgr; electron conjugated system of the aromatic compound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The above-mentioned aromatic compound produces a good effect of inhibiting overcharging but has a disadvantage of deteriorating the cycle characteristics and storage characteristics of the battery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In order to address this problem, there has been proposed a new compound, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open Nos. 156243/2000, 58112/2000, 58113/2000, 58114/2000, 58116/2000, and 58117/2000. The proposed compound produces a good effect but has a disadvantage because it contains many phenyl groups in the molecule and hence has a high molecular weight. The disadvantage is that the compound is low in solubility (and hence is limited in its amount that can be added to the electrolytic solution) and has an extended &pgr; electron conjugated system (to inhibit overcharging), with the result that consumption of overcharging current by each methyl group is low and the effect per unit amount added is poor. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 1 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> This comparative example is designed to evaluate the overcharging characteristics and storage characteristics. A cylindrical lithium secondary battery constructed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> was produced in the following manner. For the cathode active material, a mixture was prepared from artificial graphite (mesophase microbeads) and PVDF as a binder in a ratio of 91:9 by weight. The mixture was dissolved in N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP for short) as a solvent to give a paste. This paste was applied to both sides of copper foil as a cathode current collector <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The coating was dried, pressed with heating, and vacuum-dried. In this way the cathode layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> was formed on both sides of the cathode current collector <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Thus there was obtained the cathode. For the anode active material, a mixture was prepared from lithium cobaltite, graphite as a conducting material, and PVDF as a binder in a ratio of 85:7:8 by weight. The mixture was dissolved in NMP as a solvent to give a paste. This paste was applied to both sides of aluminum foil as an anode current collector <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The coating was dried, pressed with heating, and vacuum-dried. In this way the anode layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> was formed on both sides of the anode current collector <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Thus there was obtained the anode. A cathode lead <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and an anode lead <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> (both made of nickel foil) were attached by electric welding respectively to the uncoated parts of the cathode and anode. The cathode and anode, with a separator <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> interposed between them, were wound up. The outermost separator was fixed with a tape. The thus obtained electrode group was inserted into a battery can <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of stainless steel, in such a way that the cathode lead <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> comes into contact with the bottom of the can, with a polypropylene insulator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> interposed between them. The cathode lead <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> was connected by electric welding to the battery can <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> so as to form the cathode circuit. The anode lead <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> was connected by electric welding to the anode cap <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, with an anode insulator <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> interposed between them. For the electrolytic solution, a mixed solvent was prepared from ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) in a ratio of 1:2 by volume. In this solvent was dissolved 1M (mol/dm<highlight><superscript>&minus;3</superscript></highlight>) of LiPF<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>. (The composition of the electrolytic solution will be described as &ldquo;1M LiPF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>EC/DMC (1/2 by volume)&rdquo; hereinafter.) The thus obtained electrolytic solution (about 4 ml) was poured into the battery can <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through its opening. The cathode can <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> was mechanically crimped with an anode cap <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (with a gasket <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>). Thus there was obtained the cylindrical lithium secondary battery (cobalt-based battery) for Comparative Example 1. Incidentally, the anode cap <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is equipped with a safety device which is a pressure switch CID (Current Interrupt Device, which opens the circuit at about 100 kPa) consisting of heat-sensitive resistance element PTC (Positive Temperature Coefficient, resistance trip temperature at about 80&deg; C.) and aluminum foil circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The thus obtained battery was charged at a constant current of 1 A and a constant voltage of 4.2 V, with the charge end current being 20 mA. Then the battery was discharged at a discharge current of 1 A, with the discharge end voltage being 3 V. In other words, V<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>was 4.2 V and the discharge voltage was 3 V. The charging-discharging cycle was repeated twice. Then the battery was charged until 4.2 V at a current of 1 A. The battery was charged further (for overcharging) at 1 A until charging was interrupted by the action of the safety device. It was found that the battery has a charging capacity C<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>of 1380 mAh when charged to 4.2 V and the battery has an overcharging capacity C<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>of 1300 mAh when overcharged until charging was interrupted by the safety device. It follows therefore that the safety effect (&xgr;) of the battery defined in the formula (4) below is 0.94. </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>Safety effect (&xgr;)&equals;(Overcharging effect C<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)/(Initial discharge capacity C<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>)&emsp;&emsp;(4) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The smaller value of safety effect means that the battery is safe with a remote possibility of overcharging. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> For evaluation of the initial discharge capacity S<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, the battery prepared in the same way as above was charged at 1 A up to 4.2 V and then discharged at room temperature under the same conditions as mentioned above. The battery was charged again under the same conditions. The charged battery was allowed to stand at 60&deg; C. for 10 days. After cooling to room temperature, the battery was discharged at 1 A. The battery was charged and discharged again and the recovered capacity was measured. The capacity after storage is designated as S<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. The storage characteristic was evaluated according to the formula (5) below. </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>Storage characteristic (%)&equals;(Recovered discharge capacity after storage S<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)/(Initial discharge capacity S<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>)&times;100&emsp;&emsp;(5) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The battery in Comparative Example 1 has a storage characteristic of 93%. The larger is this value, the better is the storage characteristic of the battery. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 2 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> A cobalt-based battery was produced in the same way as in Comparative Example 1 except that the electrolytic solution (1M LiPF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>EC/DMC (1/2 by volume)) contains 0.1 M of anisole (An for short hereinafter) dissolved therein. The resulting battery had an overcharging capacity of 1120 mAh and a safety effect (&xgr;) of 0.81. However, it had a storage characteristic of 72%, which is lower than that of the battery in Comparative Example 1. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 1 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> An electrolytic solution was prepared from 1M LiPF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>EC/DMC (1/2 by volume), 5 vol % of methyl perfluorobutyrate (HFE1 for short hereinafter) as a fluorinated solvent, and 0.1 M of An. This electrolytic solution was used to produce the same cobalt-based battery as in Comparative Example 1. The resulting battery had a charging capacity (up to 4.2 V) of 1395 mAh, but it had an overcharging capacity of 870 mAh. Therefore, the safety effect (&xgr;) of the battery was 0.62. This result indicates that the battery containing a specific fluorinated solvent (HFE1) in the electrolytic solution decreases in overcharge current capacity much more than that in Comparative Examples 1 and 2 even though An as an overcharge inhibiting agent is used in common. Moreover, the battery in this example had a storage characteristic of 82%, which is higher by 10% than that in Comparative Example 2. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 2 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> An electrolytic solution was prepared from 1M LiPF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>EC/DMC (1/2 by volume), 5 vol % of 2,2,3,3,3-tetrafluoropropyl difluoromethyl ether (HFE2 for short hereinafter) as a fluorinated solvent, and 0.1 M of An. This electrolytic solution was used to produce the same cobalt-based battery as in Comparative Example 1. The resulting battery had a charging capacity (up to 4.2 V) of 1410 mAh, but it had an overcharging capacity of 820 mAh. Therefore, the safety effect (&xgr;) of the battery was 0.58 (which is better than that in Example 1). This result indicates that the fluorinated solvent of ether structure added to the electrolytic solution improves further the effect of inhibiting overcharging. Moreover, the battery in this example had a storage characteristic of 86%, which is higher by 4% than that in Example 1. This suggests that the fluorinated solvent of ether structure also contributes to the storage characteristics. </paragraph>

This electrolytic solution was used to produce the same cobalt-based battery as in Comparative Example 1. The resulting battery had a charging capacity (up to 4.2 V) of 1390 mAh, but it had an overcharging capacity of 810 mAh. Therefore, the safety effect (&xgr;) of the battery was 0.58. This result indicates that the fluorinated solvent of ether structure produces the effect of inhibiting overcharging. Moreover, the battery in this example had a storage characteristic of 88%, which is higher by 2% than that in Example 1. This suggests that the nanofluorobutyl methyl ether greatly improves the storage characteristics. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The above-mentioned results are summarized in Table 1. As mentioned above, the combination of an aromatic compound and a fluorinated solvent produces the effect of inhibiting overcharging for both the cobalt/graphite carbon battery and the manganese/amorphous carbon battery and gives rise to batteries which decrease in capacity only a little during storage. In addition, it was found that the aromatic compound known as an overcharge inhibiting agent has its effect enhanced when used in combination with a fluorinated solvent. Of several fluorinated solvents, that of ether structure is most effective.

<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> A battery of the same shape as in Comparative Example 4 was prepared in which the anode active material is LiNi<highlight><subscript>0.5</subscript></highlight>Mn<highlight><subscript>1.5</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and the cathode active material is graphite carbon and the electrolytic solution is 1M LiPF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>EC/DMC (1/2 by volume). This battery will be referred to as &ldquo;5V-class Mn-graphite battery&rdquo; hereinafter. This battery was charged under the condition of constant current and constant voltage (V<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>) of 4.9 V. The charging voltage was set at 4.9 V because this battery has a high average discharge voltage. The current at the end of charging was 20 mA. The battery was discharged at a constant current of 1 A until the voltage decreased to 3.7 V. This charging and discharging cycle was repeated twice, and the charging capacity (C<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>) and the overcharging capacity (C<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) were measured. It was found that the charging capacity (C<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>) is 1100 mAh and the overcharging capacity (C<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) is 870 mAh and the safety effect (&xgr;) is 0.79.

<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, the combined use of fluorinated solvent and overcharge inhibiting agent improves the safety effect and prevents the storage characteristics from decreasing also in the case of 5V-class Mn-graphite battery. In addition, ether-type fluorinated solvents are more effective than ester-type ones also in the case of 5V-class Mn-graphite battery. </paragraph>

When evaluated under the same condition as in Comparative Example 5, the resulting battery was found to have a charging capacity of 1120 mAh and an overcharging capacity of 580 mAh. Therefore, the safety effect (&xgr;) of the battery was 0.52, which is lower by 0.05 than that of the battery in Example 40. The storage characteristic of the battery was 86%, which is 1% higher than that of the battery in Example 40.

<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, the combined use of fluorinated solvent and overcharge inhibiting agent improves the safety effect and prevents the storage characteristics from decreasing also in the case of 5V-class Mn-amorphous battery. In addition, ether-type fluorinated solvents are more effective than ester-type ones also in the case of 5V-class Mn-amorphous battery. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> It has been demonstrated by Examples in the foregoing that the combined use of an overcharge inhibiting agent and a fluorinated solvent protects the lithium secondary battery from overcharging. (The fluorinated solvent enhances the action of the overcharge inhibiting agent and prevents the adverse effect of the fluorinated solvent on the storage characteristics.) The lithium secondary battery according to the present invention has a lower overcharge current than the conventional one by more than 20%. Therefore, it can be increased in capacity with safety. The first commercialized lithium secondary battery had a capacity of 1000 mAh; the capacity has increased to 2000 mAh since then. The increase in capacity is accompanied by danger. Assuming a safety effect of 0.9, the battery with a capacity of 1000 mAh has an energy of 17.1 kJ if overcharged up to 5V, whereas the battery with a capacity of 2000 mAh has an energy of 34.2 kJ if overcharged up to 5V. In other words, the latter battery has twice as much energy as the former battery. By contrast, the battery according to the present invention has a safety effect of, say, 0.6 and hence it has an energy of 28.8 kJ in its overcharged state even though it has a capacity of 2000 mAh. The magnitude of this energy is 1.68 times that of the battery with a capacity of 1000 mAh. In other words, if the safety effect is set at 0.6, the battery with an overcharge capacity of 2400 mAh will have the same energy of the conventional battery with an overcharge capacity of 2000 mAh which has a safety effect of 0.9. Thus according to the present invention, it is possible to increase the capacity of lithium batteries without impairing safety. Also, the present invention can be utilized in any electrical appliance as well. Note, an electrical appliance is defined to include any electrical object capable of utilizing a lithium secondary battery. </paragraph>
