<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a golf ball with high durability and very high resilience. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A method of improving a cover material by adding an inorganic filler (titanium dioxide and barium sulfate) thereto has been proposed, for example, in Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Hei 6-277312. The addition of titanium dioxide and barium sulfate to the cover of a golf ball is effective to give excellent properties such as a carrying performance to the golf ball. With respect to the reason for this, the document describes that the addition of titanium dioxide and barium sulfate to the cover &ldquo;shifts a weight distribution in the ball from the core center to the cover side, to increase an inertia moment of the ball, thereby increasing the carry of the golf ball&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Such a proposal, however, has been required to be further improved in terms of factors determining golf ball performances, for example, a hardness factor of the cover and core, a composition factor of the cover and core, and a dimple factor. In particular, the ball disclosed in the embodiment of the above proposal has been required to be improved in terms of feeling of hitting the ball and the carry of the ball. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the properties of a golf ball strongly demanded by golf players are generally player&apos;s soft feeling at the time of hitting the ball and the carrying performance of the ball; however, it is regarded as difficult to make both the properties compatible with each other for the following reasons: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> (1) If the core is softened for ensuring the player&apos;s soft feeling, a deformed amount of the hit ball becomes large, to degrade the durability against cracking. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> (2) If both the core and cover are softened for ensuring both the player&apos;s soft feeling and durability against cracking, the resilience and initial velocity of the ball are reduced, to sacrifice the carrying performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> (3) If the ball is excessively improved only in terms of the player&apos;s soft feeling, the other properties are sacrificed, to cause such an inconvenience that local deformation of the hit ball becomes large, not to keep the sphericalness of the ball at the initial stage of the carry of the ball, thereby degrading the carrying performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> To solve the above problems, Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2000-5341 has proposed an excellent golf ball characterized by combining a core, which is softened to improve the player&apos;s soft feeling and durability against cracking, with a cover to which a reinforcement filler is added. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Such a golf ball, however, has been required to be further improved in terms of resilience. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> An object of the present invention is to provide a golf ball with high durability and very high resilience. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> As a result of an examination made, by the present inventor, to achieve the above object, it has been found that a golf ball including: a core made from a rubber composition containing polybutadiene as a main rubber component and also an organic sulfur compound; and a cover made from a cover material mainly containing an ionomer resin composed of an Li ion neutralized type ionomer resin and a Mg ion neutralized ionomer resin, and also an inorganic filler having a specific gravity of 3.50 or more; wherein a flexural amount of the core, measured by applying a load of 980 N thereto, is in a range of 4.0 to 5.5 mm; and a specific gravity of the cover material is in a range of 1.020 to 1.110, and a Shore D hardness of the cover is in a range of 55 to 65, is advantageous in improving the productivity and exhibiting excellent properties as described below by a synergism effect of the above-described optimized requirements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> (1) Since the specific gravity of an inorganic filler is optimized, it is possible to improve the durability and prevent degradation of the resilience (carrying performance). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> (2) Since an ionomer resin composed of two kinds of ionomer resins of specific metal ion neutralized types is used, it is possible to further improve the resilience (carrying performance) and the carry of the ball. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> (3) Since the core is made from a material containing an organic sulfur compound, it is possible to improve the resilience. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The present inventor has further found that the carrying performance of the above-described golf ball is further improved by optimizing dimples of the golf ball as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> (4) If a ball is relatively soft, the spin of the hit ball becomes small, and therefor, if the ballistic path of the ball is excessively low, the carry of the ball may become insufficient because of the &ldquo;drop&rdquo; of the ball. To cope with such an inconvenience, the dimple total volume ratio (VR) is specified, to prevent the &ldquo;drop&rdquo; of the ball, thereby ensuring a high carrying performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been accomplished on the basis of the above-described knowledge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, there is provided a golf ball including: a core made from a rubber composition containing polybutadiene as a main rubber component and also an organic sulfur compound; and a cover made from a cover material mainly containing an ionomer resin composed of an Li ion neutralized type ionomer resin and a Mg ion neutralized ionomer resin, and also an inorganic filler having a specific gravity of 3.50 or more; wherein a flexural amount of the core, measured by applying a load of 980 N thereto, is in a range of 4.0 to 5.5 mm; and a specific gravity of the cover material is in a range of 1.020 to 1.110, and a Shore D hardness of the cover is in a range of 55 to 65. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In the above golf ball, preferably, a flexural amount of the golf ball, measured by applying a load of 980 N thereto, is in a range of 3.2 to 4.5 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The inorganic filler preferably contains at least barium sulfate, and a content of the inorganic filler is in a range of 10 to 25 parts by mass on the basis of 100 parts by mass of the ionomer resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A thickness of the cover is preferably in a range of 1.0 to 2.0 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> A content of the organic sulfur compound is preferably in a range of 0.05 to 3.00 parts by mass on the basis of 100 parts by mass of the main rubber component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Further, in the above golf ball, preferably, the golf ball has in the cover surface a large number of dimples; and a dimple total volume ratio (VR) is in a range of 0.85% or less, the dimple total volume ratio being defined as a ratio of a total volume of dimple spaces each of which is present under a plane surface surrounded by an edge portion of the dimple to a total volume of a virtual ball being the same as the golf ball except that the virtual ball has no dimples.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The present invention will be hereinafter described in more detail. A golf ball of the present invention includes a solid core and a cover. The solid core is made from a rubber composition containing polybutadiene as a main rubber component and also an organic sulfur compound as an essential component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Concretely, cis-1,4-polybutadiene may be used as polybutadiene as the main rubber component of the rubber composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In addition to polybutadiene, another diene based rubber, such as styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), natural rubber, isoprene rubber, or ethylene-propylene-diene rubber (EPDM) may be suitably mixed in the above base rubber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The solid core of the present invention contains an organic sulfur compound as an essential component for significantly improving the resilience thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Examples of the organic sulfur compounds may include thiophenol, thionaphthol, halogenated thiophenol, or metal salts thereof, more concretely, zinc salts of pentachlorothiophenol, pentafluorothiophenol, pentabromothiophenol, and parachlorothiophenol; and diphenyl polysulfide, dibenzil polysulfide, dibenzoil polysulfide, dibenzothiazoil polysulfide, and dithiobenzoil polysulfide, each of which has the sulfur number of 2 to 4. In particular, a zinc salt of pentachlorothiophenol or diphenyl disulfide is preferably used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the content of the organic sulfur compound may be set, on the basis of 100 parts by mass of the main rubber component, in a range of 0.05 part by mass or more, preferably, 0.10 part by mass or more, more preferably, 0.20 part by mass or more, with the upper limit being in a range of 3.00 parts by mass or less, preferably, 2.50 parts by mass or less, more preferably, 2.00 parts by mass or less. If the content is excessively small, the resilience is not improved, and if excessively large, the hardness and strength of the core are reduced, and further it may take a lot of time to mold the rubber composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In addition to the above-described main rubber component and organic sulfur compound, unsaturated carboxylic acid and/or a metal salt thereof and an organic peroxide can be added to the rubber composition of the solid core of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Examples of the unsaturated carboxylic acids may include acrylic acid, metacrylic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid. In particular, acrylic acid and metacrylic acid are preferably used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Examples of the metal salts of unsaturated carboxylic acids may include zinc salts and magnesium salts of unsaturated aliphatic acids, for example, zinc metacrylate and zinc acrylate. In particular, zinc acrylate is preferably used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The content of the unsaturated carboxylic acid and/or metal salt thereof may be set, on the basis of 100 parts by mass of the main rubber component, in a range of 10 parts by mass or more, preferably, 15 parts by mass or more, more preferably, 20 parts by mass or more, with the upper limit being in a range of 50 parts by mass or less, preferably, 45 parts by mass or less, more preferably, 40 parts by mass or less, most preferably, 35 parts by mass or less. If the content is excessively small, the resilience is reduced, and if excessively large, the solid core becomes excessively hard, which may sometimes make player&apos;s feeling of hitting of the golf ball undesirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> As the organic peroxide, there can be used a commercial product such as &ldquo;Percumyl D&rdquo; (sold by NOF CORPORATION), &ldquo;Perhexa 3M&rdquo; (sold by NOF CORPORATION), &ldquo;Luperco 231XL&rdquo; (sold by Elf Atochem Japan). Two kinds or more organic peroxides may be used in combination as needed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The content of the organic peroxide may be set, on the basis of 100 parts by mass of the main rubber component, in a range of 0.1 part by mass or more, preferably, 0.3 part by mass or more, more preferably, 0.5 part by mass or more, with the upper limit being in a range of 5 parts by mass or less, preferably, 4 parts by mass or less, more preferably, 3 parts by mass or less, most preferably, 2 parts by mass or less. If the content is excessively large or small, the resilience, player&apos;s feeling of hitting the golf ball, and durability against cracking may be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In addition to the above-described essential components, an inorganic filler can be added to the rubber composition of the present invention for adjusting the specific gravity, as needed. Examples of the inorganic fillers may include zinc oxide, barium sulfate, and calcium carbonate. In order to obtain a suitable weight and desirable resilience, the content of the inorganic filler may be set, on the basis of 100 parts by mass of the main rubber component, in a range of 1 part by mass or more, preferably, 3 parts by mass or more, more preferably, 5 parts by mass or more, most preferably, 7 parts by mass or more, with the upper limit being in a range of 60 parts by mass or less, preferably, 50 parts by mass or less, more preferably, 45 parts by mass or less, most preferably, 40 parts by mass or less. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> An antioxidant may be further added to the rubber composition of the present invention, as needed. As the antioxidant, there can be used a commercial product such as &ldquo;NOCRAC NS-6, NS-30&rdquo; (sold by Ouchi-Sinko Chemical Industrial Co., Ltd.), or &ldquo;Yoshinox 425&rdquo; (Yoshitomi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.). In order to obtain desirable resilience and durability, the content of the antioxidant may be set, on the basis of 100 parts by mass of the main rubber component, in a range of 0 part by mass or more, preferably, 0.05 part by mass or more, more preferably, 0.1 part by mass or more, most preferably, 0.2 part by mass or more, with the upper limit being in a range of 3 parts by mass or less, preferably, 2 parts by mass or less, more preferably, 1 part by mass or less, most preferably, 0.5 part by mass or less. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The solid core of the present invention can be formed by vulcanizing and heating the above-described rubber composition by a known process. For example, a vulcanizing temperature may be set in a range of 100 to 200&deg; C., and a vulcanizing time be set in a range of 10 to 40 min. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the hardness of the solid core, which is expressed in a flexural amount, that is, a deformed amount of the solid core measured by applying a load of 980 N (100 kg) thereto, may be set in a range of 4.0 mm or more, preferably, 4.2 mm or more, more preferably, 4.6 mm or more, with the upper limit being in a range of 5.5 mm or less, preferably, 5.3 mm or less, more preferably, 5.2 mm or less. If the flexural amount, that is, the flexural amount is excessively small, player&apos;s feeling of hitting the golf ball becomes harder, and particularly, the spin of the ball becomes excessively high at the time of long-shot with a driver when the ball is liable to be largely deformed, to reduce the carry of the ball, and if excessively large, player&apos;s feeling of hitting the ball becomes dull, the carry of the ball is reduced because of insufficient resilience, and durability against cracking due to repeated hitting is degraded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The diameter of the solid core of the present invention may be set in a range of 38.0 mm or more, preferably, 38.5 mm or more, more preferably, 38.7 mm or more, most preferably, 38.9 mm or more, with the upper limit being in a range of 41.0 mm or less, preferably, 40.7 mm or less, more preferably, 40.3 mm or less, most preferably, 40.1 mm or less. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The specific gravity of the solid core may be set in a range of 1.000 or more, preferably, 1.050 or more, more preferably, 1.100 or more, with the upper limit being in a range of 1.300 or less, preferably, 1.250 or less, more preferably, 1.200 or less. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The golf ball of the present invention is a solid golf ball including the above-described solid core and a cover. Such a solid golf ball may be any one of a two-piece type including one cover layer and a multi-piece type including two or more cover layers. The solid golf ball of the present invention, however, is required to have a cover layer made from a specific cover material to be described later, irrespective of the type. According to the present invention, particularly, from the viewpoint of effectively achieving the effect of improving a golf ball, the golf ball may be of a two-piece solid golf ball. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The cover of the golf ball of the present invention is made from a cover material mainly containing an ionomer resin. To improve the resilience, the ionomer resin is required to be composed of an Li ion neutralized ionomer resin and a Mg ion neutralized ionomer resin. In this case, the mixing ratio in mass between the Li ion neutralized ionomer resin and the Mg ion neutralized ionomer resin may be set in a range of 95:5 to 10:90, preferably, 90:10 to 30:70. If the mixing ratio is out of the above range, it may fail to improve the resilience. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> As the above ionomer resin, there can be used a commercial product, for example, &ldquo;Surlyn 6320 or 7930&rdquo; (Du Pont DE NEMOURS &amp; COMPANY, USA). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The cover material of the present invention is required to contain an inorganic filler. The specific gravity of the inorganic filler may be set in a range of 3.50 or more, preferably, 3.60 or more, more preferably, 3.70 or more, with the upper limit being in a range of 20.0 or less, preferably, 10.0 or less, more preferably, 7.5 or less. If the specific gravity is excessively small, it fails to improve the durability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The content of the inorganic filler may be set, on the basis of 100 parts by mass of the ionomer resin, in a range of 10 parts by mass or more, preferably, 11 parts by mass or more, more preferably, 12 parts by mass or more, with the upper limit being in a range of 25 parts by mass or less, preferably, 24 parts by mass or less, more preferably, 23 parts by mass or less. If the content is excessively small, it fails to improve the durability, and if excessively large, the resilience and the moldability may be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Examples of the inorganic fillers may include barium sulfate and titanium dioxide. Preferably, barium sulfate and titanium dioxide are used in combination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the specific gravity of the cover material is required to be adjusted in a range of 1.020 or more, preferably, 1.030 or more, more preferably, 1.040 or more, with the upper limit being in a range of 1.110 or less, preferably, 1.090 or less. With such adjustment, it is possible to improve the durability and suppress reduction in the resilience due to excessive addition of the inorganic filler. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In addition, a UV absorbent, an oxidation inhibitor, a dispersant, and a coloring agent may be added to the cover material, as needed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The cover of the golf ball of the present invention can be formed by a known process of putting the solid core in a specific mold for injection molding, and injection-molding the cover material. Alternatively, the cover can be formed by preparing a pair of cup-halves made from the cover material, putting the solid core covered with the cup-halves in a specific mold, and press-molding the resultant solid core covered with the cup-halves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The Shore D hardness of the cover of the golf ball of the present invention may be set in a range of 55 or more, preferably, 56 or more, more preferably, 57 or more, with the upper limit being in a range of 65 or less, preferably, 64 or less, more preferably, 63 or less. In this way, the cover of the golf ball is relatively harder than a cover of a general golf ball; however, the cover can exhibit desirable resilience while keeping high durability against cracking. If the hardness is higher than the above range, player&apos;s feeling of hitting the ball is degraded, and if lower than the above range, the resilience is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In spite of the type of the golf ball, that is, a two-piece solid golf ball or a multi-piece solid golf ball (in this case, the thickness of a cover is the total thickness of cover layers), the thickness of the cover may be set in a range of 1.0 mm or more, preferably, 1.2 mm or more, with the upper limit being in a range of 1.3 mm or less, preferably, 2.0 mm or less, more preferably, 1.9 mm or less. If the cover is excessively thick, player&apos;s feeling of hitting the ball may be degraded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Like a general golf ball, the golf ball of the present invention has in the cover surface a large number of dimples. These dimples are required to be optimized for obtaining a desirable carry of the ball by preventing the drop of the ball. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The optimization of the dimples will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is an enlarged sectional view of one dimple illustrating the definition of a VR (Volume Ratio) of dimples according to the present invention. In the figure, the right and left top points E at the edge portion of the dimple are horizontally positioned, and the deepest portion of the dimple having a maximum depth De is located at the center of the dimple. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> To be more specific, the top points E are defined as points at which a dimple diameter Di crosses a circle formed by the edge portion of the dimple, and the maximum depth De is defined as a distance from a line connecting the points E to each other to the deepest portion of the dimple. Each dimple volume V is defined as a volume of the dimple space present under the plane surface surrounded by the edge portion of the dimple. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the dimples are optimized by specifying a dimple total volume ratio (VR) in a range of 0.85% or less, preferably, 0.84% or less, more preferably, 0.83% or less. The dimple total volume ratio (VR) is defined as a ratio of a total volume of dimple spaces each of which is present under a plane surface surrounded by an edge portion of the dimple to a total volume of a virtual ball being the same as the golf ball except that the virtual ball has no dimples. With this optimization of the dimples, it is possible to prevent the drop of the hit ball, and hence to improve the carry of the ball. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The volume V of each dimple can be measured, for example, by a measurement apparatus described in Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Hei 11-30508. If the dimples are not optimized as described above, the hit ball may be dropped, to reduce the carry of the ball. In addition, there is no limitation to the total number, kinds, shape, and the like of the dimples. For example, the total number of the dimples may be set in a range of 350 pieces or more, preferably, 370 pieces or more, with the upper limit being in a range of 500 pieces or less, preferably, 480 pieces or less. The kinds of the dimples may be set in a range of two or more, preferably, three or more. The shape of each dimple is not limited to the circular shape, and the diameter of each dimple may be set in a range of 2.0 mm or more, preferably, 2.2 mm or more, with the upper limit being in a range of 5.0 mm or less, preferably, 4.8 mm or less. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The golf ball of the present invention can be produced with its diameter and weight specified under a golf rule for golf games. Concretely, the diameter of the golf ball can be set in a range of 42.67 mm or more, with the upper limit being in a range of 44.0 mm or less, preferably, 43.5 mm or less, more preferably, 43.0 mm or less, and the weight of the golf ball can be set in a range of 45.93 g or less, with the lower limit being in a range of 44.5 g or more, preferably, 44.8 g or more, most preferably, 45.0 or more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> As described above, the present invention can provide a golf ball with high durability and very high resilience. </paragraph>
