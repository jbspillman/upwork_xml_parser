<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men with an estimated 317,000 cases in 1996 in the United States. It is the second leading cause of death among men who die from neoplasia with an estimated 40,000 deaths per year. Prompt detection and treatment is needed to limit mortality caused by prostate cancer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Detection of Prostate Cancer </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> When it metastasizes, prostatic cancer has a distinct predilection for bone and lymph nodes. Saitoh et al., &ldquo;Metastatic Patterns of Prostatic Cancer. Correlation Between Sites And Number Of Organs Involved,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Cancer, </italic></highlight>54:3078-3084 (1984). At the time of clinical diagnosis, as many as 25% of patients have bone metastasis demonstrable by radionuclide scans. Murphy, G. P., et al., &ldquo;The National Survey Of Prostate Cancer In The United States By The American College Of Surgeons,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>J. Urol., </italic></highlight>127:928-939 (1982). Accurate clinical evaluation of nodal involvement has proven to be difficult. Imaging techniques such as computed tomography (&ldquo;CT&rdquo;) or magnetic resonance (&ldquo;MR&rdquo;) imaging are unable to distinguish metastatic prostate cancer involvement of lymph nodes by criterion other than size (i.e., &gt;1 cm). Therefore, by definition, these imaging modalities are inherently insensitive in the detection of small volume (&lt;1 cm) disease as well as non-specific in the detection of larger volume adenopathy. A recent study assessed the accuracy of MR in patients with clinically localized prostate cancer. Rifkin et al., &ldquo;Comparison Of Magnetic Resonance Imaging And Ultrasonography In Staging Early Prostate Cancer,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>N. Engel. J. Med., </italic></highlight>323:621-626 (1990). In this study, 194 patients underwent an MR and 185 of these patients had a lymph node dissection. 23 (13%) patients had pathologically involved lymph nodes. MR was suspicious in only 1 of these 23 cases resulting in a sensitivity of 4%. Similar results have also been noted with CT scans. Gasser et al., &ldquo;MRI And Ultrasonography In Staging Prostate Cancer,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>N. Engl. J. Med. </italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>Correspondence</italic></highlight>), 324 (7): 49-495 (1991). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The elevation of serum acid phosphatase activity in patients having metastasized prostate carcinoma was first reported by Gutman et al., <highlight><italic>J. Clin. Invest </italic></highlight>17:473 (1938). In cancer of the prostate, prostatic acid phosphatase is released from the cancer tissue into the blood stream with the result that the total serum acid phosphatase level can be greatly increased above normal values. Numerous studies of this enzyme and its relation to prostatic cancer have been made since that time, e.g. Yam, <highlight><italic>Amer. J. Med. </italic></highlight>56:604 (1974). However, the measurement of serum acid phosphatase is elevated in about 65-90 percent of patients having carcinoma of the prostate with bone metastasis; in about 30 percent of patients without roentgenological evidence of bone metastasis; and in about only 5-10 percent of patients lacking clinically demonstrable metastasis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Prior art attempts to develop a specific test for prostatic acid phosphatase have met with only limited success, because techniques which rely on enzyme activity on a so-called &ldquo;specific&rdquo; substrate cannot take into account other biochemical and immunochemical differences among the many acid phosphatases which are unrelated to enzyme activity of prostate origin. In the case of isoenzymes, i.e. genetically defined enzymes having the same characteristic enzyme activity and a similar molecular structure but differing in amino acid sequences and/or content and, therefore, immunochemically distinguishable, it would appear inherently impossible to distinguish different isoenzyme forms merely by the choice of a particular substrate. It is, therefore, not surprising that none of these prior art methods is highly specific for the direct determination of prostatic acid phosphatase activity; e.g. see <highlight><italic>Cancer </italic></highlight>5:236 (1952); <highlight><italic>J. Lab. Clin. Med. </italic></highlight>82:486 (1973); <highlight><italic>Clin. Chem. Acta. </italic></highlight>44:21 (1973); and <highlight><italic>J. Physiol. Chem. </italic></highlight>356:1775 (1975). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In addition to the aforementioned problems of non-specificity which appear to be inherent in many of the prior art reagents employed for the detection of prostate acid phosphatase, there have been reports of elevated serum acid phosphatase associated with other diseases, which further complicates the problem of obtaining an accurate clinical diagnosis of prostatic cancer. For example, Tuchman et al., <highlight><italic>Am. J. Med. </italic></highlight>27:959 (1959) noted that serum acid phosphatase levels appear to be elevated in patients with Gaucher&apos;s disease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Due to the inherent difficulties in developing a &ldquo;specific&rdquo; substrate for prostate acid phosphatase, several researchers have developed immunochemical methods for the detection of prostate acid phosphatase. However, the previously reported immunochemical methods have drawbacks of their own which have precluded their widespread acceptance. For example, Shulman et al., <highlight><italic>Immunology </italic></highlight>93:474 (1964) described an immuno-diffusion test for the detection of human prostate acid phosphatase. Using antisera prepared from a prostatic fluid antigen obtained by rectal massage from patients with prostatic disease, no cross-reactivity precipitin line was observed in the double diffusion technique against extracts of normal kidney, testicle, liver, and lung. However, this method has the disadvantages of limited sensitivity, even with the large amounts of antigen employed, and of employing antisera which may cross-react with other, antigenically unrelated serum protein components present in prostatic fluid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> WO 79/00475 to Chu et. al. describes a method for the detection of prostatic acid phosphatase isoenzyme patterns associated with prostatic cancer which obviates many of the above drawbacks. However, practical problems are posed by the need for a source of cancerous prostate tissue from which the diagnostically relevant prostatic acid phosphatase isoenzyme patterns associated with prostatic cancer are extracted for the preparation of antibodies thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In recent years, considerable effort has been spent to identify enzyme or antigen markers for various types of malignancies with the view towards developing specific diagnostic reagents. The ideal tumor marker would exhibit, among other characteristics, tissue or cell-type specificity. Previous investigators have demonstrated the occurrence of human prostate tissue-specific antigens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Treatment of Prostate Cancer </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> As described in W. J. Catalona, &ldquo;Management of Cancer of the Prostate,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>New Engl. J. Med., </italic></highlight>331(15): 996-1004 (1994), the management of prostate cancer can be achieved by watchful waiting, curative treatment, and palliation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> For men with a life expectancy of less than 10 years, watchful waiting is appropriate where low-grade, low-stage prostate cancer is discovered at the time of a partial prostatectomy for benign hyperplasia. Such cancers rarely progress during the first five years after detection. On the other hand, for younger men, curative treatment is often more appropriate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Where prostate cancer is localized and the patient&apos;s life expectancy is 10 years or more, radical prostatectomy offers the best chance for eradication of the disease. Historically, the drawback of this procedure is that most cancers had spread beyond the bounds of the operation by the time they were detected. However, the use of prostate-specific antigen testing has permitted early detection of prostate cancer. As a result, surgery is less extensive with fewer complications. Patients with bulky, high-grade tumors are less likely to be successfully treated by radical prostatectomy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> After surgery, if there are detectable serum prostate-specific antigen concentrations, persistent cancer is indicated. In many cases, prostate-specific antigen concentrations can be reduced by radiation treatment. However, this concentration often increases again within two years. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Radiation therapy has also been widely used as an alternative to radical prostatectomy. Patients generally treated by radiation therapy are those who are older and less healthy and those with higher-grade, more clinically advanced tumors. Particularly preferred procedures are external-beam therapy which involves three dimensional, conformal radiation therapy where the field of radiation is designed to conform to the volume of tissue treated; interstitial-radiation therapy where seeds of radioactive compounds are implanted using ultrasound guidance; and a combination of external-beam therapy and interstitial-radiation therapy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> For treatment of patients with locally advanced disease, hormonal therapy before or following radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy has been utilized. Hormonal therapy is the main form of treating men with disseminated prostate cancer. Orchiectomy reduces serum testosterone concentrations, while estrogen treatment is similarly beneficial. Diethylstilbestrol from estrogen is another useful hormonal therapy which has a disadvantage of causing cardiovascular toxicity. When gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists are administered testosterone concentrations are ultimately reduced. Flutamide and other nonsteroidal, anti-androgen agents block binding of testosterone to its intracellular receptors. As a result, it blocks the effect of testosterone, increasing serum testosterone concentrations and allows patients to remain potent&mdash;a significant problem after radical prostatectomy and radiation treatments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Cytotoxic chemotherapy is largely ineffective in treating prostate cancer. Its toxicity makes such therapy unsuitable for elderly patients. In addition, prostate cancer is relatively resistant to cytotoxic agents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Use of Monoclonal Antibodies in Prostate Cancer Detection and Treatment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Theoretically, radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies (&ldquo;mAbs&rdquo;) offer the potential to enhance both the sensitivity and specificity of detecting prostatic cancer within lymph nodes and elsewhere. While many mAbs have previously been prepared against prostate related antigens, none of these mAbs were specifically generated with an imaging objective in mind. Nevertheless, the clinical need has led to evaluation of some of these mAbs as possible imaging agents. Vihko et al., &ldquo;Radioimaging of Prostatic Carcinoma With Prostatic Acid Phosphatase&mdash;Specific Antibodies,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Biotechnology in Diagnostics, </italic></highlight>131-134 (1985); Babaian et al., &ldquo;Radioimmunological Imaging of Metastatic Prostatic Cancer With 111-Indium-Labeled Monoclonal Antibody PAY 276,<highlight><italic>&rdquo; J. Urol., </italic></highlight>137:439-443 (1987); Leroy et al., &ldquo;Radioimmunodetection Of Lymph Node Invasion In Prostatic Cancer. The Use Of Iodine 123 (123-I)-Labeled Monoclonal Anti-Prostatic Acid Phosphatase (PAP) 227 A F (ab&prime;) 2 Antibody Fragments In Vivo,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Cancer, </italic></highlight>64:1-5 (1989); Meyers et al., &ldquo;Development Of Monoclonal Antibody Imaging Of Metastatic Prostatic Carcinoma,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>The Prostate, </italic></highlight>14:209-220 (1989). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In some cases, the monoclonal antibodies developed for detection and/or treatment of prostate cancer recognize antigens specific to malignant prostatic tissues. Such antibodies are thus used to distinguish malignant prostatic tissue (for treatment or detection) from benign prostatic tissue. See U.S. Pat. No. 4,970,299 to Bazinet et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 4,902,615 to Freeman et al. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Other monoclonal antibodies react with surface antigens on all prostate epithelial cells whether cancerous or benign. See U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,446,122 and Re 33,405 to Chu et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,863,851 to McEwan et al., and U.S. Pat. No. 5,055,404 to Ueda et al. However, the antigens detected by these monoclonal antibodies are present in the blood and, therefore, compete with antigens at tumor sites for the monoclonal antibodies. This causes background noise which makes the use of such antibodies inadequate for in vivo imaging. In therapy, such antibodies, if bound to a cytotoxic agent, could be harmful to other organs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Horoszewicz et al., &ldquo;Monoclonal Antibodies to a New Antigenic Marker in Epithelial Prostatic Cells and Serum of Prostatic Cancer Patients,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Anticancer Research, </italic></highlight>7:927-936 (1987) (&ldquo;Horoszewicz&rdquo;) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,162,504 to Horoszewicz describe an antibody, designated 7E11, which recognizes prostate specific membrane antigen (&ldquo;PSMA&rdquo;). Israeli et al., &ldquo;Molecular Cloning of a Complementary DNA Encoding a Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Cancer Research, </italic></highlight>53:227-230 (1993) (&ldquo;Israeli&rdquo;) describes the cloning and sequencing of PSMA and reports that PSMA is prostate-specific and shows increased expression levels in metastatic sites and in hormone-refractory states. Other studies have indicated that PSMA is more strongly expressed in prostate cancer cells relative to cells from the normal prostate or from a prostate with benign hyperplasia. Furthermore, PSMA is not found in serum (Troyer et al., &ldquo;Detection and Characterization of the Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) in Tissue Extracts and Body Fluids,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Int. J. Cancer, </italic></highlight>62:552-558 (1995)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> These characteristics make PSMA an attractive target for antibody mediated targeting for imaging and therapy of prostate cancer. Imaging studies using indium-labeled 7E11 have indicated that the antibody localizes quite well to both the prostate and to sites of metastasis. In addition, 7E11 appears to have clearly improved sensitivity for detecting lesions compared to other currently available imaging techniques, such as CT and MR imaging or bone scan. Bander, &ldquo;Current Status of Monoclonal Antibodies for Imaging and Therapy of Prostate Cancer,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Sem. In Oncology, </italic></highlight>21:607-612 (1994). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> However, the use of 7E11 and other known antibodies to PSMA to mediate imaging and therapy has several disadvantages. First, PSMA is an integral membrane protein known to have a short intracellular tail and a long extracellular domain. Biochemical characterization and mapping (Troyer et al., &ldquo;Biochemical Characterization and Mapping of the 7E11-C5.3 Epitope of the Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Urol. Oncol., </italic></highlight>1:29-37 (1995)) have shown that the epitope or antigenic site to which the 7E11 antibody binds is present on the intracellular portion of the molecule. Because antibody molecules do not, under normal circumstances, cross the cell membrane unless they bind to the extracellular portion of a molecule and become translocated intracellularly, the 7E11 antibody does not have access to its antigenic target site in an otherwise healthy, viable cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Consequently, imaging using 7E11 is limited to the detection of dead cells within tumor deposits. Additionally, the therapeutic use of the 7E11 antibody is limited, because only cells that are already dead or tissue containing a large proportion of dead cells can be effectively targeted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to overcoming the deficiencies of prior art antibodies in diagnosing and treating prostate cancer. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> One aspect of the present invention relates to a method of ablating or killing normal, benign hyperplastic, and cancerous prostate epithelial cells. The process involves providing a biological agent which recognizes an extracellular domain of prostate specific membrane antigen. The biological agent can be used alone or can be bound to a substance effective to kill the cells upon binding of the biological agent to the cells. These biological agents are then contacted with the cells under conditions effective to permit both binding of the biological agent to the extracellular domain of the prostate specific membrane antigen and killing or ablating of the cells. </paragraph>

Hybridoma cell lines that produce monoclonal antibodies of these types are also disclosed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The biological agents of the present invention recognize the extracellular domain of antigens of normal, benign hyperplastic, and cancerous prostate epithelial cells. Unlike the 7E11 antibody, which recognizes an epitope of prostate-associated antigens which are exposed extracellularly only after cell lysis, the biological agents of the present invention bind to antigenic epitopes which are extracellularly exposed in living prostate cells. Using the biological agents of the present invention, living, unfixed normal, benign hyperplastic, and cancerous prostate epithelial cells can be targeted, which makes treatment and diagnosis more effective. In a preferred embodiment, the biological agents of the present invention also bind to and are internalized with the prostate specific membrane antigen, which permits the therapeutic use of intracellularly acting cytotoxic agents.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> One aspect of the present invention relates to a method of ablating or killing normal, benign hyperplastic, and cancerous prostate epithelial cells. The process involves providing a biological agent, such as an antibody or binding portion thereof, probe, or ligand, which binds to an extracellular domain of prostate specific membrane antigen of (i.e., a portion of prostate specific membrane antigen which is external to) such cells. The biological agent can be used alone or can be bound to a substance effective to kill the cells upon binding of the biological agent to the cells. These biological agents are then contacted with the cells under conditions effective to permit both binding of the biological agent to the extracellular domain of the prostate specific membrane antigen and killing or ablating of the cells. In its preferred form, such contacting is carried out in a living mammal by administering the biological agent to the mammal under conditions effective to permit both binding of the biological agent to the extracellular domain of the prostate specific membrane antigen and killing or ablating of the cells. Such administration can be carried out orally or parenterally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In a particularly preferred embodiment of the method of ablating or killing normal, benign hyperplastic, and cancerous prostate epithelial cells in accordance with the present invention, the biological agent binds to and is internalized with the prostate specific membrane antigen of such cells. Again, the biological agent can be used alone. Alternatively, the biological agent can be bound to a substance effective to kill the cells upon binding of the biological agent to prostate specific membrane antigen and upon internalization of the biological agent with the prostate specific membrane antigen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The mechanism by which the biological agent is internalized with the prostate specific membrane antigen is not critical to the practice of the present invention. For example, the biological agent can induce internalization of the prostate specific membrane antigen. Alternatively, internalization of the biological agent can be the result of routine internalization of prostate specific membrane antigen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the present invention relates to a method of detecting normal, benign hyperplastic, and cancerous epithelial cells or portions thereof in a biological sample. This method involves providing a biological agent, such as an antibody or binding portion thereof, probe, or ligand, which binds to an extracellular domain of prostate specific membrane antigen of such cells. The biological agent is bound to a label effective to permit detection of the cells or portions (e.g., prostate specific membrane antigen or fragments thereof liberated from such normal, benign hyperplastic, and cancerous cells) thereof upon binding of the biological agent to the cells or portions thereof. The biological sample is contacted with the biological agent having a label under conditions effective to permit binding of the biological agent to the extracellular domain of the prostate specific membrane antigen of any of the cells or portions thereof in the biological sample. The presence of any cells or portions thereof in the biological sample is detected by detection of the label. In its preferred form, such contacting is carried out in a living mammal and involves administering the biological agent to the mammal under conditions effective to permit binding of the biological agent to the prostate specific membrane antigen of any of the cells or portions thereof in the biological sample. Again, such administration can be carried out orally or parenterally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The method of the present invention can be used to screen patients for diseases associated with the presence of normal, benign hyperplastic, and cancerous epithelial cells or portions thereof. Alternatively, it can be used to identify the recurrence of such diseases, particularly when the disease is localized in a particular biological material of the patient. For example, recurrence of prostatic disease in the prostatic fossa may be encountered following radical prostatectomy. Using the method of the present invention, this recurrence can be detected by administering a short range radiolabeled antibody to the mammal and then detecting the label rectally, such as with a transrectal detector probe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the contacting step can be carried out in a sample of serum or urine or other body fluids, such as to detect the presence of PSMA in the body fluid. When the contacting is carried out in a serum or urine sample, it is preferred that the biological agent recognize substantially no antigens circulating in the blood other than PSMA. Since intact prostate cells do not excrete or secrete PSMA into the extracellular environment, detecting PSMA in serum, urine, or other body fluids generally indicates that prostate cells are being lysed. Thus, the biological agents and methods of the present invention can be used to determine the effectiveness of a prostate cancer treatment protocol by monitoring the level of PSMA in serum, urine or other body fluids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In a particularly preferred embodiment of the method of detecting normal, benign hyperplastic, and cancerous prostate epithelial cells in accordance with the present invention, the biological agent, such as the antibody or binding portion thereof, probe, or ligand, binds to and is internalized with the prostate specific membrane antigen of such cells. Again, the biological agent is bound to a label effective to permit detection of the cells or portions thereof upon binding of the biological agent to and internalization of the biological agent with the prostate specific membrane antigen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> As indicated above, biological agents suitable for either killing, ablating, or detecting normal, benign hyperplastic, and cancerous prostate epithelial cells include antibodies, such as monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies. In addition, antibody fragments, half-antibodies, hybrid derivatives, probes, and other molecular constructs may be utilized. These biological agents, such as antibodies, binding portions thereof, probes, or ligands, bind to extracellular domains of prostate specific membrane antigens or portions thereof in normal, benign hyperplastic, and cancerous prostate epithelial cells. As a result, the biological agents bind to all such cells, not only to cells which are fixed or cells whose intracellular antigenic domains are otherwise exposed to the extracellular environment. Consequently, binding of the biological agents is concentrated in areas where there are prostate epithelial cells, irrespective of whether these cells are fixed or unfixed, viable or necrotic. Additionally or alternatively, these biological agents, such as antibodies, binding portions thereof, probes, or ligands, bind to and are internalized with prostate specific membrane antigens or portions thereof in normal, benign hyperplastic, and cancerous prostate epithelial cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Monoclonal antibody production may be effected by techniques which are well-known in the art. Basically, the process involves first obtaining immune cells (lymphocytes) from the spleen of a mammal (e.g., mouse) which has been previously immunized with the antigen of interest either in vivo or in vitro. The antibody-secreting lymphocytes are then fused with (mouse) myeloma cells or transformed cells, which are capable of replicating indefinitely in cell culture, thereby producing an immortal, immunoglobulin-secreting cell line. The resulting fused cells, or hybridomas, are cultured, and the resulting colonies screened for the production of the desired monoclonal antibodies. Colonies producing such antibodies are cloned, and grown either in vivo or in vitro to produce large quantities of antibody. A description of the theoretical basis and practical methodology of fusing such cells is set forth in Kohler and Milstein, <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>256:495 (1975), which is hereby incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Mammalian lymphocytes are immunized by in vivo immunization of the animal (e.g., a mouse) with the protein or polypeptide of the present invention. Such immunizations are repeated as necessary at intervals of up to several weeks to obtain a sufficient titer of antibodies. Following the last antigen boost, the animals are sacrificed and spleen cells removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Fusion with mammalian myeloma cells or other fusion partners capable of replicating indefinitely in cell culture is effected by standard and well-known techniques, for example, by using polyethylene glycol (&ldquo;PEG&rdquo;) or other fusing agents (See Milstein and Kohler, <highlight><italic>Eur. J. Immunol. </italic></highlight>6:511 (1976), which is hereby incorporated by reference). This immortal cell line, which is preferably murine, but may also be derived from cells of other mammalian species, including but not limited to rats and humans, is selected to be deficient in enzymes necessary for the utilization of certain nutrients, to be capable of rapid growth, and to have good fusion capability. Many such cell lines are known to those skilled in the art, and others are regularly described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Procedures for raising polyclonal antibodies are also well known. Typically, such antibodies can be raised by administering the protein or polypeptide of the present invention subcutaneously to New Zealand white rabbits which have first been bled to obtain pre-immune serum. The antigens can be injected at a total volume of 100 Al per site at six different sites. Each injected material will contain synthetic surfactant adjuvant pluronic polyols, or pulverized acrylamide gel containing the protein or polypeptide after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The rabbits are then bled two weeks after the first injection and periodically boosted with the same antigen three times every six weeks. A sample of serum is then collected 10 days after each boost. Polyclonal antibodies are then recovered from the serum by affinity chromatography using the corresponding antigen to capture the antibody. Ultimately, the rabbits are euthenized with pentobarbital 150 mg/Kg IV. This and other procedures for raising polyclonal antibodies are disclosed in E. Harlow, et. al., editors, <highlight><italic>Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual </italic></highlight>(1988), which is hereby incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In addition to utilizing whole antibodies, the processes of the present invention encompass use of binding portions of such antibodies. Such binding portions include Fab fragments, F(ab&prime;)<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>fragments, and Fv fragments. These antibody fragments can be made by conventional procedures, such as proteolytic fragmentation procedures, as described in J. Goding, <highlight><italic>Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice</italic></highlight>, pp. 98-118 (N.Y. Academic Press 1983), which is hereby incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the processes of the present invention can utilize probes or ligands found either in nature or prepared synthetically by recombinant DNA procedures or other biological or molecular procedures. Suitable probes or ligands are molecules which bind to the extracellular domains of prostate specific membrane antigens identified by the monoclonal antibodies of the present invention. Other suitable probes or ligands are molecules which bind to and are internalized with prostate specific membrane antigens. Such probes or ligands can be, for example, proteins, peptides, lectins, or nucleic acid probes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> It is particularly preferred to use the monoclonal antibodies identified below in Table 1.

<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> These antibodies can be used alone or as a component in a mixture with other antibodies or other biological agents to treat or image prostate epithelial cells with varying surface antigen characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Regardless of whether the biological agents are used for treatment or therapy, they can be administered orally, parenterally, subcutaneously, intravenously, intramuscularly, intraperitoneally, by intranasal instillation, by intracavitary or intravesical instillation, intraocularly, intraarterially, intralesionally, or by application to mucous membranes, such as, that of the nose, throat, and bronchial tubes. They may be administered alone or with pharmaceutically or physiologically acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers, and can be in solid or liquid form such as, tablets, capsules, powders, solutions, suspensions, or emulsions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The solid unit dosage forms can be of the conventional type. The solid form can be a capsule, such as an ordinary gelatin type containing the biological agent, such as an antibody or binding portion thereof, of the present invention and a carrier, for example, lubricants and inert fillers such as, lactose, sucrose, or cornstarch. In another embodiment, these compounds are tableted with conventional tablet bases such as lactose, sucrose, or cornstarch in combination with binders like acacia, cornstarch, or gelatin, disintegrating agents such as, cornstarch, potato starch, or alginic acid, and a lubricant like stearic acid or magnesium stearate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The biological agent of the present invention may also be administered in injectable dosages by solution or suspension of these materials in a physiologically acceptable diluent with a pharmaceutical carrier. Such carriers include sterile liquids such as water and oils, with or without the addition of a surfactant and other pharmaceutically and physiologically acceptable carrier, including adjuvants, excipients or stabilizers. Illustrative oils are those of petroleum, animal, vegetable, or synthetic origin, for example, peanut oil, soybean oil, or mineral oil. In general, water, saline, aqueous dextrose and related sugar solution, and glycols such as, propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol, are preferred liquid carriers, particularly for injectable solutions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> For use as aerosols, the biological agent of the present invention in solution or suspension may be packaged in a pressurized aerosol container together with suitable propellants, for example, hydrocarbon propellants like propane, butane, or isobutane with conventional adjuvants. The materials of the present invention also may be administered in a non-pressurized form such as in a nebulizer or atomizer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The biological agents may be utilized to detect normal, benign hyperplastic, and cancerous prostate epithelial cells in vivo. This is achieved by labeling the biological agent, administering the labeled biological agent to a mammal, and then imaging the mammal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Examples of labels useful for diagnostic imaging in accordance with the present invention are radiolabels such as <highlight><superscript>131</superscript></highlight>I, <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In, <highlight><superscript>123</superscript></highlight>I, <highlight><superscript>99m</superscript></highlight>Tc, <highlight><superscript>32</superscript></highlight>P, <highlight><superscript>125</superscript></highlight>I, <highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>H, <highlight><superscript>14</superscript></highlight>C, and <highlight><superscript>188</superscript></highlight>Rh, fluorescent labels such as fluorescein and rhodamine, nuclear magnetic resonance active labels, positron emitting isotopes detectable by a positron emission tomography (&ldquo;PET&rdquo;) scanner, chemiluminescers such as luciferin, and enzymatic markers such as peroxidase or phosphatase. Short-range radiation emitters, such as isotopes detectable by short-range detector probes, such as a transrectal probe, can also be employed. These isotopes and transrectal detector probes, when used in combination, are especially useful in detecting prostatic fossa recurrences and pelvic nodal disease. The biological agent can be labeled with such reagents using techniques known in the art. For example, see Wensel and Meares, <highlight><italic>Radioimmunoimaging and Radioimmunotherapy, </italic></highlight>Elsevier, N.Y. (1983), which is hereby incorporated by reference, for techniques relating to the radiolabeling of antibodies. See also, D. Colcher et al., &ldquo;Use of Monoclonal Antibodies as Radiopharmaceuticals for the Localization of Human Carcinoma Xenografts in Athymic Mice&rdquo;, <highlight><italic>Meth. Enzymol. </italic></highlight>121: 802-816 (1986), which is hereby incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> A radiolabeled biological agent of this invention can be used for in vitro diagnostic tests. The specific activity of a tagged biological agent, such as a tagged antibody, binding portion thereof, probe, or ligand, depends upon the half-life, the isotopic purity of the radioactive label, and how the label is incorporated into the biological agent. Table 2 lists several commonly-used isotopes, their specific activities and half-lives. In immunoassay tests, the higher the specific activity, in general, the better the sensitivity.

<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> In the case of a radiolabeled biological agent, the biological agent is administered to the patient, is localized to the tumor bearing the antigen with which the biological agent reacts, and is detected or &ldquo;imaged&rdquo; in vivo using known techniques such as radionuclear scanning using e.g., a gamma camera or emission tomography. See e.g., A. R. Bradwell et al., &ldquo;Developments in Antibody Imaging&rdquo;, <highlight><italic>Monoclonal Antibodies for Cancer Detection and Therapy, </italic></highlight>R. W. Baldwin et al., (eds.), pp. 65-85 (Academic Press 1985), which is hereby incorporated by reference. Alternatively, a positron emission transaxial tomography scanner, such as designated Pet VI located at Brookhaven National Laboratory, can be used where the radiolabel emits positrons (e.g., <highlight><superscript>11</superscript></highlight>C, <highlight><superscript>18</superscript></highlight>F, <highlight><superscript>15</superscript></highlight>O, and <highlight><superscript>13</superscript></highlight>N) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Fluorophore and chromophore labeled biological agents can be prepared from standard moieties known in the art. Since antibodies and other proteins absorb light having wavelengths up to about 310 nm, the fluorescent moieties should be selected to have substantial absorption at wavelengths above 310 nm and preferably above 400 nm. A variety of suitable fluorescers and chromophores are described by Stryer, Science, 162:526 (1968) and Brand, L. et al., <highlight><italic>Annual Review of Biochemistry, </italic></highlight>41:843-868 (1972), which are hereby incorporated by reference. The biological agents can be labeled with fluorescent chromophore groups by conventional procedures such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,940,475, 4,289,747, and 4,376,110, which are hereby incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> One group of fluorescers having a number of the desirable properties described above are the xanthene dyes, which include the fluoresceins derived from 3,6-dihydroxy-9-henylxanthhydrol and resamines and rhodamines derived from 3,6-diamino-9-phenylxanthydrol and lissanime rhodamine B. The rhodamine and fluorescein derivatives of 9-o-carboxyphenylxanthhydrol have a 9-o-carboxyphenyl group. Fluorescein compounds having reactive coupling groups such as amino and isothiocyanate groups such as fluorescein isothiocyanate and fluorescamine are readily available. Another group of fluorescent compounds are the naphthylamines, having an amino group in the &agr; or &bgr; position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Biological agents can be labeled with fluorchromes or chromophores by the procedures described by Goding, J. (supra, pp 208-249). The biological agents can be labeled with an indicating group containing the NMR-active <highlight><superscript>19</superscript></highlight>F atom, or a plurality of such atoms inasmuch as (i) substantially all of naturally abundant fluorine atoms are the <highlight><superscript>19</superscript></highlight>F isotope and, thus, substantially all fluorine-containing compounds are NMR-active; (ii) many chemically active polyfluorinated compounds such as trifluoracetic anhydride are commercially available at relatively low cost, and (iii) many fluorinated compounds have been found medically acceptable for use in humans such as the perfluorinated polyethers utilized to carry oxygen as hemoglobin replacements. After permitting such time for incubation, a whole body NMR determination is carried out using an apparatus such as one of those described by Pykett, <highlight><italic>Scientific American, </italic></highlight>246:78-88 (1982), which is hereby incorporated by reference, to locate and image prostate epithelial cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> In cases where it is important to distinguish between regions containing live and dead prostate epithelial cells or to distinguish between live and dead prostate epithelial cells, the antibodies of the present invention (or other biological agents of the present invention), labeled as described above, can be coadministered along with an antibody or other biological agent which recognizes only living or only dead prostate epithelial cells labeled with a label which can be distinguished from the label used to label the subject antibody. By monitoring the concentration of the two labels at various locations or times, spatial and temporal concentration variations of living and dead normal, benign hyperplastic, and cancerous prostate epithelial cells can be ascertained. In particular, this method can be carried out using the labeled antibodies of the present invention, which recognize both living and dead epithelial prostate cells, and labeled 7E11 antibodies, which recognize only dead epithelial prostate cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The biological agents can also be utilized to kill or ablate normal, benign hyperplastic, and cancerous prostate epithelial cells in vivo. This involves using the biological agents by themselves or with a cytotoxic drug to which the biological agents recognizing normal, benign hyperplastic, and cancerous prostate epithelial cells are bound. This involves administering the biological agents bonded to a cytotoxic drug to a mammal requiring such treatment. Since the biological agents recognize prostate epithelial cells, any such cells to which the biological agents bind are destroyed. Although such administration may destroy normal prostate epithelial cells, this is not problematic, because the prostate is not required for life or survival. Although the prostate may indirectly contribute to fertility, this is not likely to be a practical consideration in patients receiving the treatment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The biological agents of the present invention may be used to deliver a variety of cytotoxic drugs including therapeutic drugs, a compound emitting radiation, molecules of plants, fungal, or bacterial origin, biological proteins, and mixtures thereof. The cytotoxic drugs can be intracellularly acting cytotoxic drugs, such as short-range radiation emitters, including, for example, short-range, high-energy &agr;-emitters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Enzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof are exemplified by diphtheria toxin A fragment, nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin, exotoxin A (from <highlight><italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic></highlight>), ricin A chain, abrin A chain, modeccin A chain, &agr;-sacrin, certain <highlight><italic>Aleurites fordii </italic></highlight>proteins, certain Dianthin proteins, <highlight><italic>Phytolacca americana </italic></highlight>proteins (PAP, PAPII and PAP-S), <highlight><italic>Morodica charantia </italic></highlight>inhibitor, curcin, crotin, Saponaria officinalis inhibitor, gelonin, mitogillin, restrictocin, phenomycin, and enomycin, for example. Procedures for preparing enzymatically active polypeptides of the immunotoxins are described in WO84/03508 and WO85/03508, which are hereby incorporated by reference. Certain cytotoxic moieties are derived from adriamycin, chlorambucil, daunomycin, methotrexate, neocarzinostatin, and platinum, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Procedures for conjugating the biological agents with the cytotoxic agents have been previously described. Procedures for conjugating chlorambucil with antibodies are described by Flechner, I,. <highlight><italic>European Journal of Cancer, </italic></highlight>9:741-745 (1973); Ghose, T. et al., <highlight><italic>British Medical Journal, </italic></highlight>3:495-499 (1972); and Szekerke, M., et al., <highlight><italic>Neoplasma, </italic></highlight>19:211-215 (1972), which are hereby incorporated by reference. Procedures for conjugating daunomycin and adriamycin to antibodies are described by Hurwitz, E. et al., <highlight><italic>Cancer Research, </italic></highlight>35:1175-1181 (1975) and Arnon, R. et al. <highlight><italic>Cancer Surveys, </italic></highlight>1:429-449 (1982), which are hereby incorporated by reference. Procedures for preparing antibody-ricin conjugates are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,414,148 and by Osawa, T., et al. <highlight><italic>Cancer Surveys, </italic></highlight>1:373-388 (1982) and the references cited therein, which are hereby incorporated by reference. Coupling procedures as also described in EP 86309516.2, which is hereby incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> In a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention, a first biological agent is conjugated with a prodrug which is activated only when in close proximity with a prodrug activator. The prodrug activator is conjugated with a second biological agent according to the present invention, preferably one which binds to a non-competing site on the prostate specific membrane antigen molecule. Whether two biological agents bind to competing or non-competing binding sites can be determined by conventional competitive binding assays. For example, monoclonal antibodies J591, J533, and E99 bind to competing binding sites on the prostate specific membrane antigen molecule. Monoclonal antibody J415, on the other hand, binds to a binding site which is non-competing with the site to which J591, J533, and E99 bind. Thus, for example, the first biological agent can be one of J591, J533, and E99, and the second biological agent can be J415. Alternatively, the first biological agent can be J415, and the second biological agent can be one of J591, J533, and E99. Drug-prodrug pairs suitable for use in the practice of the present invention are described in Blakely et al., &ldquo;ZD2767, an Improved System for Antibody-directed Enzyme Prodrug Therapy That Results in Tumor Regressions in Colorectal Tumor Xenografts,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Cancer Research, </italic></highlight>56:3287-3292 (1996), which is hereby incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the biological agent can be coupled to high energy radiation emitters, for example, a radioisotope, such as <highlight><superscript>131</superscript></highlight>I, a &ggr;-emitter, which, when localized at the tumor site, results in a killing of several cell diameters. See, e.g., S. E. Order, &ldquo;Analysis, Results, and Future Prospective of the Therapeutic Use of Radiolabeled Antibody in Cancer Therapy&rdquo;, <highlight><italic>Monoclonal Antibodies for Cancer Detection and Therapy, </italic></highlight>R. W. Baldwin et al. (eds.), pp 303-316 (Academic Press 1985), which is hereby incorporated by reference. Other suitable radioisotopes include &agr;-emitters, such as <highlight><superscript>212</superscript></highlight>Bi, <highlight><superscript>213</superscript></highlight>Bi, and <highlight><superscript>211</superscript></highlight>At, and &bgr;-emitters, such as <highlight><superscript>186</superscript></highlight>Re and <highlight><superscript>90</superscript></highlight>Y. Radiotherapy is expected to be particularly effective, because prostate cancer is a relatively radiosensitive tumor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Where the biological agents are used alone to kill or ablate prostate epithelial cells, such killing or ablation can be effected by initiating endogenous host immune functions, such as complement-mediated or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The biological agent of the present invention can be used and sold together with equipment, as a kit, to detect the particular label. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Biological agents of the present invention can be used in conjunction with other therapeutic treatment modalities. Such other treatments include surgery, radiation, cryosurgery, thermotherapy, hormone treatment, chemotherapy, vaccines, and other immunotherapies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Also encompassed by the present invention is a method of killing or ablating which involves using the biological agents for prophylaxis. For example, these materials can be used to prevent or delay development or progression of prostate cancer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Use of the prostate cancer therapy of the present invention has a number of benefits. Since the biological agents according to the present invention only target prostate epithelial cells, other tissue is spared. As a result, treatment with such biological agents is safer, particularly for elderly patients. Treatment according to the present invention is expected to be particularly effective, because it directs high levels of biological agents, such as antibodies or binding portions thereof, probes, or ligands, to the bone marrow and lymph nodes where prostate cancer metastases predominate. Moreover, tumor sites for prostate cancer tend to be small in size and, therefore, easily destroyed by cytotoxic agents. Treatment in accordance with the present invention can be effectively monitored with clinical parameters such as serum prostate specific antigen and/or pathological features of a patient&apos;s cancer, including stage, Gleason score, extracapsular, seminal, vesicle or perineural invasion, positive margins, involved lymph nodes, etc. Alternatively, these parameters can be used to indicate when such treatment should be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Because the biological agents of the present invention bind to living prostate cells, therapeutic methods using these biological agents are much more effective than those which target lysed prostate cells. For the same reasons, diagnostic and imaging methods which determine the location of living normal, benign hyperplastic, or cancerous prostate epithelial cells are much improved by employing the biological agents of the present invention. In addition, the ability to differentiate between living and dead prostate cells can be advantageous, especially to monitor the effectiveness of a particular treatment regimen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Hybridomas E99, J415, J533, and J591 have been deposited pursuant to, and in satisfaction of, the requirements of the Budapest Treaty on the International Recognition of the Deposit of Microorganisms for the Purposes of Patent Procedure with the American Type Culture Collection (&ldquo;A.T.C.C.&rdquo;) at 12301 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, Md. 20852. Hybridoma E99 was deposited on May 2, 1996, and received A.T.C.C. Designation Number HB-12101. Hybridoma J415 was deposited on May 30, 1996, and received A.T.C.C. Designation Number HB-12109. Hybridomas J533 and J591 were deposited on Jun. 6, 1996, and received A.T.C.C. Designation Numbers HB-12127 and HB-12126, respectively. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> LNCaP cells (2&times;10<highlight><superscript>7</superscript></highlight>) were biotinylated with biotin-NHSS (at final concentration of 5 mM) for 30 minutes on ice. After washing, the biotinylated cells were resuspended in 1 ml lysis buffer (20 mM Tris/HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, 1% triton X-100) for 30 min on ice. The suspension was centrifuged at 1500 g&times;100 min at 4&deg; C., and the supernatant was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm&times;15 min at 4&deg; C. The resulting lysate was preabsorbed with rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG-coated pansorbin for 1 hour at 4&deg; C. The pre-absorbed lysate was incubated with the mAb overnight at 4&deg; C. Rabbit or goat anti-mouse Ig-coated agarose beads were added for 2 hours at 4&deg; C. and then washed. The beads were resuspended in Tris-base/NaCl, added to sample buffer with 2-mercaptoethanol, and boiled for 5 min. After centrifuging, the supernatant was run on an SDS-PAGE 12% gel. The gel was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane which was blocked and stained with straptavidin-peroxidase. The membrane was developed with diaminobenzidine (&ldquo;DAB&rdquo;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Sequential immunoprecipitation was similar except that the lysate was initially pre-cleared with one mAb overnight at 4&deg; C. A second mAb was then used to immunoprecipitate the pre-cleared lysate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Approximately 2000 clones were screened, of which four clones were selected as described in Example 3, above. After subcloning, supernatants from the 4 hybridomas, E99, J415, J533, and J591, were assayed by immunofluorescence against viable (i.e. unfixed) LNCaP, immunoprecipitation, and sequential immunoprecipitation to confirm reactivity to PSMA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> The immunofluorescence study using the LNCaP target cell (described originally in Horoszewicz, which is hereby incorporated by reference, to make the 7E11 antibody and the prototype cell line for expression for PSMA) shows that E99 antibody binds to and renders viable LNCaP cells immunofluorescent. This is in contrast to the 7E11 antibody, which, as noted originally in Horoszewicz, which is hereby incorporated by reference, gives only poor or no binding to viable LNCaP cells but exhibits strong binding once the cells are fixed (killed). </paragraph>

Seminal plasma (400 &mgr;g/lane) or LNCaP lysate were loaded into lanes of 12% SDS-PAGE gels. After electrophoresis, the gels are transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% dry milk/Tris-buffered saline-tween 20 (&ldquo;TBST&rdquo;) for 60 min at room temperature. After washing, the membranes were incubated with primary mAb for 60 min at room temperature. After repeat washing, the membranes were incubated with sheep anti-mouse-Ig-peroxidase {fraction (1/5000)} in 5% dry milk/TBST for 60 min at room temperature. After repeat washing, the membranes were developed using a chemiluminescent tag designated &ldquo;ECL&rdquo; (Amersham Life Sciences, International, Arlington Heights, Ill.) according to the manufacturer&apos;s directions. The results of the Western Blot experiment are presented in Table 4.

<heading lvl="1">Competition Studies </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> A competition study was carried out to determine whether J591, J533, E99, and J415 detected the same or different antigenic sites (epitopes) of the prostate specific membrane antigen molecule using the following procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Plates were coated with LNCaP cell line lysate as a source of prostate specific membrane antigen and washed to remove unbound material. &ldquo;Cold&rdquo; (unlabeled) monoclonal antibody was incubated on the plate for 1 hour at room temperature to allow binding to its antigenic site. Subsequently, a second monoclonal antibody, labeled either with biotin or <highlight><superscript>125</superscript></highlight>I, was added for an additional hour. Plates were washed to remove unbound material. The amount of the second monoclonal antibody bound to the prostate specific membrane antigen-coated plate was determined either by avidin-alkaline phosphatase in an enzyme-linked immunoassay (in the case of biotin-labeled second monoclonal antibody) or by physically counting the well in a gamma counter (in the case of <highlight><superscript>125</superscript></highlight>I-labeled second monoclonal antibody). Controls consisted of using the same monoclonal antibody both cold and labeled to define &ldquo;100% competition&rdquo; or using monoclonal antibody to a totally different molecule (e.g., monoclonal antibody I-56, which detects inhibin, a prostate related protein different from prostate specific membrane antigen) to define &ldquo;0% competition&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The results indicated that J591, J533, and E99 each interfere, compete, or block binding of one another but do not block binding of J415 and vice versa. 7E11/CYT356, known to bind PSMA at a different (intracellular) site, did not block any of J591, J533, E99, or J415. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Having pairs of monoclonal antibodies which bind to non-competing sites permits development of antibody sandwich assays for detecting soluble antigens, such as solubilized prostate specific membrane antigen or fragment thereof, in, for example, body fluids. For example, the antigen (e.g., prostate specific membrane antigen or a fragment thereof) could be &ldquo;captured&rdquo; from body fluid with J591 and, in another step, detected by labeled J415. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> In another setting, e.g. treatment, one could increase antibody binding by using a combination of non-competing monoclonal antibodies. For example, assuming the non-competing sites are each represented once on the prostate specific membrane antigen molecule, adding a combination of J591 plus J415 would bind twice as many monoclonal antibody molecules as either monoclonal antibody alone. Binding two non-competing antigenic binding sites also can result in greater antigen cross-linking and, perhaps, increased internalization. Furthermore, since the two detected sites are physically located on the same prostate specific membrane antigen molecule, the binding of two monoclonal antibody molecules to that single prostate specific membrane antigen molecule puts the two monoclonal antibody molecules in close proximity to each other, a setting which provides optimal drug-prodrug interaction. For example, monoclonal antibody J591 can be conjugated with an inactive pro-drug and J415 can be conjugated with a pro-drug activator. Since prodrug and activator would be bound in close proximity only at the site of prostate specific membrane antigen-expressing cells (e.g., prostate cancer cells), prodrug activation to the active form would occur only at those sites. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> VH and VK cDNA were prepared using reverse transcriptase and mouse &kgr; constant region and mouse IgG constant region primers. The first strand cDNAs were amplified by PCR using a variety of mouse signal sequence primers (6 for VH and 7 for VK). The amplified DNAs were gel-purified and cloned into the vector pT7Blue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> The VH and VK clones obtained were screened for correct inserts by PCR, and the DNA sequence of selected clones was determined by the dideoxy chain termination method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Excluding the primer region (as the sequence of this depended on the sequence of the primer that was used), all the VH clones obtained gave identical sequence. This sequence was obtained from clones produced with three different 5&prime; primers. One clone had one base pair change within the signal sequence, and one clone contained an aberrant PCR product. Using the sequencing strategy shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the nucleotide sequence for the heavy chain was obtained. It is designated SEQ. ID.
