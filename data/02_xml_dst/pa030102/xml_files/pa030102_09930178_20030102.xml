<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">Access to a CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection) network is provided via a telephone line by providing a master modem at the head end and a slave modem at the subscriber end of the line. The master modem provides a CSMA/CD interface to the network and controls half duplex communications with the slave modem via the line to avoid collisions of information packets on the line. The information packets are enveloped in frames on the line with error checking information; control information between the modems is contained in the same and/or in separate frames. The modulation method and signal bandwidth can be varied depending on errors to provide optimum communications capacity via any particular line, and a ratio of upstream to downstream information packets can be varied depending on buffer fills at the modems. The master modem can be multiplexed for multiple lines. The modulated signal frequencies are above telephone signal frequencies so that each line can be frequency diplexed for simultaneous telephone communications. </paragraph>

<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/640,705 filed May 1, 1996 in the names of J. B. Terry et al. entitled &ldquo;Information Network Access Apparatus And Methods For Communicating Information Packets Via Telephone Lines&rdquo;, pending, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference This invention relates to information network access, and is particularly concerned with apparatus and methods for communicating information packets, generally referred to as Ethernet frames, via two-wire lines such as telephone subscriber lines. </paragraph>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Computers and related devices are increasingly being connected into networks for communications between the devices. Typically, the networks comprise LANs (local area networks) which provide communications among devices within a relatively small geographical area different LANs being interconnected via MANs (metropolitan area networks) and WANs (wide area networks). This has resulted in a global computer information network which is generally known as the Internet. The term &ldquo;Network&rdquo; is used herein to refer generically to this global computer information network and to any other network of computers and related devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Different technologies can be used to facilitate communications on any LAN and throughout the Network, the most common being Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) technology. This is documented in IEEE Standard 802.3 entitled &ldquo;Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) Access Method and Physical Layer Specifications&rdquo; which has been adopted by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). The 802.3 Standard is based on the 1985 Version 2 Standard for Ethernet and, although there are some differences including different use of a length/type field, the two Standards are largely interchangeable and can be considered equivalent as far as this invention is concerned. The term &ldquo;CSMA/CD&rdquo; is used herein to refer generically to this technology. Using CSMA/CD, packets of data are communicated in frames that are generally referred to as Ethernet frames. This term is also used herein, regardless of whether the frames comply with the 802.3 Standard or the Ethernet Standard (i.e. regardless of the value contained in the length/type field of the frame). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) reference model established by the ISO defines packetized communications protocols in seven layers, of which Layer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is the physical layer which is concerned with the physical interfaces between devices and the communications medium, and Layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is the data link layer which is concerned with sending and receiving blocks of data together with information for example for synchronization and error and flow control. For LANs, the data link layer is generally considered as comprising two sub-layers, referred to as the LLC (logical link control) layer and the MAC (medium access control) layer. The LLC layer (Layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) is addressed by IEEE Standard 802.2. The CSMA/CD Standards address communications at the MAC and physical layers (Layers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A particularly convenient and popular physical medium for LAN communications is twisted pair wiring as is commonly used for telephone communications. Such wiring typically consists of 0.4 mm to 0.6 mm diameter (26 AWG to 22 AWG) unshielded wires twisted together in pairs in a multipair cable. For example, one of the options for the physical layer documented for CSMA/CD is referred to as 10BASE-T and provides baseband communications at a data rate of 10 Mb/s over twisted pair wiring. The performance specifications are generally met by up to 100 m (meters) of 0.5 mm telephone twisted pair wire without the use of a repeater. Longer wiring lengths are permitted as long as the performance specifications, in particular a maximum delay, are met. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, devices that are located relatively close to one another, for example within a building, can be relatively easily connected in a LAN using twisted pair wiring. For CSMA/CD communications via the LAN and for access to the Network, each device is easily equipped with an Ethernet interface card, which is connected via a respective twisted pair of wires to a repeater or CSMA/CD hub, and with TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) software that handles the packetized communications at Layers <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the OSI model (Network and Transport Layers, respectively). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Increasingly, access to the Network is required from devices that are relatively distant from existing Network facilities. For example, such devices may be located within residences and small businesses, and they may be isolated computers or they may be connected in a LAN that is not connected to the rest of the Network. Such devices may for example comprise general-purpose computers or specific-purpose devices such as a Network browser, game machine, and/or entertainment device, and may also comprise related and/or ancillary equipment such as workstations, printers, scanners, bridges, routers, etc. that it may be desired to connect to the Network. The generic term &ldquo;terminal device&rdquo; and its abbreviation &ldquo;ID&rdquo; is used below to embrace all such devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is known to provide for access to the Network from a relatively distant terminal device, or TD, via a communications path between a router on the Network and the distant TD, the communications path typically being constituted by a telephone line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A simple form of such a communications path is a serial link comprising modem communications via a conventional two-wire telephone line. At Layers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the OSI model the CSMA/CD communication, which can not be used on the serial link because of its length and characteristics, is replaced for the communication with each distant TD by modem communications via the respective telephone line and a point-to-point protocol, such as PPP (Point to Point Protocol) or SLIP (Serial Link Internet Protocol). Currently, modem communications generally provide a maximum data rate of 28.8 kb/s, and may typically operate in practice at lower, fall-back, data rates such as 19.2 or 14.4 kb/s. Such data rates are increasingly insufficient to meet demands imposed on communications for Network access, in particular for rapid downloading of relatively large amounts of data, e.g. for graphics. In addition, use of such modem communications prevents simultaneous use of the telephone line for telephone communications. Furthermore, such a communications path is set up as a dialled connection via the public switched telephone network (PSTN), which involves the inconvenience to the distant TD user of having to establish the dialled connection and the disadvantage of long connection times via the PSTN. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> An alternative form of telephone communications path comprises an ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) telephone line. This provides two 64 kb/s B-channels each of which can be used for carrying voice communications or data A TD can be connected to the ISDN line via a terminal adapter, which can thereby provide a total bit rate of 128 kb/s for data on both B-channels, or 64 kb/s for data on one B-channel simultaneously with digital telephone voice communications on the other B-channel While this provides a significant increase in data rate compared with using a conventional two-wire telephone line, it requires an ISDN telephone line which, in the relatively limited areas in which it is available, involves additional cost, and the connection still has the disadvantage of being a dialled connection via the telephone network. In addition, a terminal adapter is generally more costly than a modem. Furthermore, even data rates of 64 kb/s or 128 kb/s are likely to be increasingly insufficient with evolution of the Network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Higher speed telecommunications lines may be available for lease to provide high data rate communications, but these are not economical for TDs in residences and most small businesses. Cable modems have also been proposed for providing Network access via coaxial (coax) or hybrid fiber-coax (HFC) cable television distribution networks that provide bidirectional communications. While such proposals offer the possibility of high data rates, they are also limited to their own serving areas and are likely to involve relatively high costs for both the modem equipment and the ongoing use of the service. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, there is an increasing need to facilitate access from terminal devices to the Network at relatively low cost both for equipment and ongoing service, that is not restricted to particular areas, that provides for high data rates, and that desirably does not preempt telephone communications or require long connection times via the PSTN. An object of this invention is to address this need. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> According to one aspect, this invention provides a method of communicating information packets to and from a CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection) path via a bidirectional communications path, comprising the steps of: coupling a first end of the communications path to a first modem; communicating information packets between the CSMA/CD path and the first modem via a CSMA/CD interface: coupling a second end of the communications path to a second modem; communicating information packets and control information, for controlling operation of the second modem, from the first modem to the second modem via the communications path; and communicating information packets from the second modem to the first modem via the communications path under control of the control information; the control information providing half duplex communications on the bidirectional communications path. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The half duplex communications, which can alternatively be considered as time division duplex or time compression multiplex communications, avoid collisions or interference between information packets communicated in the two directions of communication on the communications path by ensuring that the communications in the two directions take place at different times. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Preferably each step of communicating information packets comprises enveloping them in information frames which also comprise error check fields for error checking of at least the enveloped information packets. Information relating to operation of the modems, such as the control information from the first modem to the second modem and response information from the second modem to the first modem, can be included in at least some of the information frames and/or in further frames which comprise this information and an error check field for error checking of at least this information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Preferably each information packet communicated between the modems via the communications path comprises at least address, length, and data fields of an Ethernet frame communicated via the CSMA/CD path, it desirably also comprises a frame check sequence of the respective Ethernet frame, and may further comprise a preamble and start frame delimiter of an Ethernet frame. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, the communications path comprises a two-wire telephone subscriber line and the modems communicate said information packets via the line at frequencies greater than telephone signal frequencies, the method further comprising the steps of communicating telephone signals via the line and, at each end of the line, combining telephone signals and information packets to be communicated via the line, and separating telephone signals and information packets communicated via the line, using a diplexer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The method can further comprise the step of multiplexing signals of the first modem for communicating information packets between the first modem and a plurality of second modems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The method can further comprise the steps of monitoring errors in communicating said information packets between the first and second modems via the communications path, and determining operations of the first and second modems in dependence upon monitored errors. The step of determining operations of the moderns in dependence upon monitored errors can comprise varying a signal bandwidth and/or a modulation method of the modems. This enables an optimum rate to be achieved for communicating information packets via any particular two-wire line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The method can further comprise the step of communicating information packets between the second modem and a second CSMA/CD path via a second CSMA/CD interface.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates elements of a known arrangement for access from a subscriber to the Network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> via a conventional two-wire telephone line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Subscriber equipment includes a terminal device (TD) <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which for example is constituted by a personal computer (PC), and a modem <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> connected to the line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and for example providing a maximum data rate of 28.8 kb/s. Although shown separately from the TD <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the modem <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can instead be incorporated therein. The modern <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> communicates with a modem in a pool of dial-up modems <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> with a dialled connection which is established in well-known manner via the PSTN <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to which the telephone line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is connected. The modems in the modem pool <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are connected via an Ethernet interface (ENET I/F) <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to a router <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> which is connected to the Network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and hence can be considered to be a part of the Network, the Network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> generally being considered to include all of the terminal devices connected to it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> An upper part of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates protocols in accordance with which the arrangement operates. TCP/IP operates at OSI Layers <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> end-to-end throughout the entire Network and access arrangement, with TCP/IP software running on the TD <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. At the MAC layer of OSI Layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, communications in the access arrangement between the Ethernet interface <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the TD <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> operate in accordance with a point-to-point protocol such as PPP or SLIP, and communications between the Ethernet interface <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the Network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and within the Network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, comprise Ethernet frames as described below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. These frames can be carried in a wide variety of forms and via various physical media, for example as the Ethernet frames themselves on a CSMA/CD LAN, in ATM (asynchronous transfer mode) cells, in SONET (synchronous optical network) formats, and so on. For communications between the Network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the TD <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the router <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> converts between the Ethernet frames of the Network and the serial communications on the line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> between the modems <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> A generally similar arrangement to that of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is provided in the event that the telephone line is an ISDN line, except that the modem <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is replaced by an ISDN terminal adapter and communications on the line are digital at a rate that can be 64 or 128 kb/s. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates the Ethernet frame at the MAC layer. It consists of, in order, a preamble field of 7 bytes or octets (8 bits) of alternating 1s and 0s starting with a 1; a start frame delimiter (SFD) field of 1 byte having the sequence 10101011; a destination address field of 6 bytes: a source address field of 6 bytes: a length or type field of 2 bytes described further below; a data field of 46 to 1500 bytes, and a frame check sequence (FCS) field of 4 bytes or octets constituted by a CRC (cyclic redundancy check) of the data packet constituted by the address, length or type, and data fields. Data of less than 46 bytes in a frame is padded to the minimum data field size of 46 bytes. In accordance with the 802.3 Standard, the length or type field represents the length of data in the data field up to the maximum of 1500 bytes. In accordance with the Ethernet Standard, the length or type field is a value greater than 1500 that represents the type of data packet, and IP data packets are identified by one specific type value in this field. Thus the two Standards are different but inter-operable in this respect. It follows from this format that each frame comprises a data packet of from 60 to 1514 bytes, together with overhead (preamble, SFD, and FCS fields) of 12 bytes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the CSMA/CD Standards, the bits of each Ethernet frame are communicated using Manchester coding (a 1 bit is encoded as a 01 sequence, and a 0 bit is encoded as a 10 sequence, in each case with a transition in the middle of the bit period) at a predetermined data rate which is typically 10 Mb/s. Any terminal device connected to a CSMA/CD LAN can transmit a frame to the LAN (Multiple Access) in accordance with a contention scheme which is summarized by the following steps: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> 1. Monitor the LAN (Carrier Sense). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> 2. When the LAN is idle, transmit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> 3. While transmitting, monitor the LAN for a collision (Collision Detection) by comparing transmitted bits with what is received from the LAN. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> 4. When a collision is detected, continue transmitting for a short period so that all TDs on the LAN detect the collision (this is referred to as jamming). Wait a random period of time determined by a binary exponential back-off algorithm, then return to step 1 for retransmission. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The minimum and maximum Ethernet frame size, predetermined data rate, and characteristics and lengths of segments of the LAN are inter-related in a manner that ensures effective operation of this contention scheme. For a 10BASE-T LAN using twisted pair wiring, as explained in the background of the invention this results in a maximum segment length of the order of 100 meters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The two-wire telephone line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the arrangement of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is constituted by twisted pair wiring, but has a length which is invariably much greater than 100 meters. Typically the length may be a maximum of about 5500 meters, with an average length for telephone lines in North America of the order of 1700 meters. These lengths are much greater than the approximate 100 meter maximum for a 10BASE-T LAN, and propagation delays make it impossible for the contention scheme outlined above to operate over such distances of twisted pair wiring. Even if this were not the case, signal attenuation over these distances of twisted pair wiring would make it very difficult to provide any reliable detection of collisions. Accordingly, it is not practical to use CSMA/CD on the telephone line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Instead, the serial link point-to-point protocols are used in conjunction with the modems <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> as discussed above to provide Network access, with the data rate and other limitations discussed in the background of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates a Network access arrangement in accordance with an embodiment of this invention which is described first below, and also illustrates variations of this which are described subsequently below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> TD <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of a subscriber is again connected to the Network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> via a two-wire telephone subscriber line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which in this arrangement, as in the arrangement of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, is not being used for telephone communications. The TD <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in this arrangement is connected to the line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> via an Ethernet interface (ENET I/F) <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and a modem <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The interface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is a conventional Ethernet interface which, although shown separately from the TD <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, can be conveniently incorporated into the TD <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> either on a plug-in card or as a permanent part of the TD <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The interface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is the same as would be provided for connecting the TD <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> directly to a CSMA/CD LAN. The modem <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> has a form for example as described in detail below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, and has an Ethernet interface that is connected to the interface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and a two-wire line interface that is connected to the line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Conveniently, the connection between the Ethernet interface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the modem <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is a 10BASE-T connection using twisted pair wiring. The modem <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is referred to below as a slave modem as explained further below. The Ethernet interface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> provides a Network address for the TD <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> as is well known. Similarly, the Ethernet interface within the modem <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> provides this with a Network address. Although the slave modem <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is shown separately from the interface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the TD <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the modem <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can be physically combined with the Ethernet interface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for example as described below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, and can be incorporated into the TD <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> At its other end, for example at a PSTN central office (CO) or remote terminal (RT), the two-wire telephone line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is connected to a modem <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> which is referred to as a master modem and an example of which is described below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. The modem <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> also has a 10BASE-T Ethernet interface which provides the master modem with a Network address. This interface is connected via twisted pair wiring <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, an Ethernet switch <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, and a router <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to the rest of the Network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in known manner. As is well known, functions of the switch <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and router <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> can be combined in a single device referred to as a brouter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> An upper part of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates in a similar manner to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, protocols in accordance with which the Network access arrangement operates. As in the arrangement of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, TCP/IP operates at OSI Layers <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> end-to-end throughout the entire Network and access arrangement, with TCP/IP software running on the TD <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. At the MAC layer, communications within and between the Network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, router <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, switch <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, and master modem <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> comprise Ethernet frames as described above. Similarly, communications between the slave modem <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the Ethernet interface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> comprise Ethernet frames as described above, and the TD <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> operates in exactly the same known manner as it would if the interface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> were connected directly to a LAN. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Communications between the master modem <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the slave modem <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are carried out in accordance with a new point-to-point protocol which uses collision avoidance to communicate Ethernet frames between the modems. This protocol is described below and for convenience is referred to herein as ECAP (Ethernet frame Collision Avoidance Protocol). It is observed that this protocol operates only between the modems <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and hence need not be known to, and does not change the operation of, the TD <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> or the rest of the Network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The protocol and modems simply serve to replace a direct (short-distance) connection between the interface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the twisted pair wiring <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> by a remote connection via the (much greater distance) two-wire line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Thus although as described here the line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is a telephone subscriber line, it can be appreciated that the same arrangement of master and slave modems operating in accordance with this new protocol can be used to communicate Ethernet frames via any twisted pair wiring which is too long to permit conventional 10BASE-T or similar LAN interconnections. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> also illustrates a management device <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, for example a computer, coupled to the Ethernet switch <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> for providing operations, administration, management, test, and other functions relating to the communications in known manner. In order to provide communications via multiple lines <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to multiple subscribers, preferably the master modem <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> contains multiplexing functions as described below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, and other master modems, one of which is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and referenced <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>&prime;, are connected to the switch <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> similarly to the modem <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> At the subscriber, one or more further arrangements of a slave modem <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>&prime;, Ethernet interface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>&prime;, and TD <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&prime; can be similarly connected to the same two-wire line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as shown by a dashed line connection <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Alternatively (or in addition), and generally more desirably, as shown by a dashed line connection <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> the 10BASE-T connection of the slave modem <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can be connected to a bridge <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of known form, to which a plurality of TDs <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&Prime; can be connected via their respective Ethernet interfaces (E I/Fs) in known manner to provide a subscriber LAN. These arrangements can be extended as desired in known manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> It can be seen from the above description that embodiments of the invention are centered on the arrangement and functioning of the modems <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Before describing embodiments of these in detail, a further Network access arrangement is described below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. This further arrangement illustrates that the communications on each line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can comprise not only the data communications for the Network as described herein but also conventional telephone communications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, this illustrates the master and slave modems <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> respectively, with 10BASE-T interfaces to twisted pair wiring <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> respectively as described above, coupled via a two-wire subscriber line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which also serves for conventional telephone connections between a subscriber telephone <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and a telephone CO or RT <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> connected to the PSTN. To this end, a passive diplexer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is provided at each end of the two-wire line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the two diplexers <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> conveniently having the same form and being for example as described below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. Thus at a head end of the line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> the CO or RT <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and the master modem <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are connected via a diplexer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to the line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and at a subscriber end of the line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> the subscriber telephone <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and the slave modem <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are connected to the line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> via a diplexer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. As also shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the master modem <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can be multiplexed for other telephone subscriber lines <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&prime; to which it is similarly connected via respective diplexers <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>&prime;. It can be appreciated that diplexers can be similarly provided in the arrangement of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> to permit simultaneous telephone and Network communications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates a simple form of the diplexer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, which comprises a d.c. and low pass filter (LPF) <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> between a two-wire connection to the line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a two-wire connection to the telephone <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> or CO or RT <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and a d.c. isolator and high pass filter (HPF) <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> between the two-wire connection to the line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a two-wire connection to the modem <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the LPF <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> can comprise one or more balanced filter sections comprising series inductors (which pass the telephone loop current) and shunt capacitors, and the HPF <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> can comprise two series capacitors having a capacitance such that they do not represent a significant load to the line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. More complicated forms of diplexer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> can be provided as desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The graph in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates the low frequency spectrum <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of analog telephony signals, and two high frequency spectra <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> for Network communications. A desirable response <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> for the LPF <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the diplexer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> separates the low frequency telephony signals on the two-wire line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> from the Network communications signals on the same line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. It can be seen from this illustration that the telephony and Network communications signals occupy substantially different frequency bands and hence are easily separated by the diplexers <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the spectra <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> relate to two different signal bandwidths which can be used for the Network communications. For example, the relatively wide bandwidth spectrum <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> can correspond to a modulation method with a symbol or clock rate of 3 MHz, and the relatively narrower bandwidth spectrum <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> can correspond to a modulation method with a symbol or clock rate of 300 kHz. Other signal bandwidths, not shown, can be similarly provided. The use of different bandwidths and modulation methods is described further below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates a form of the master modem <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, including optional but desirable multiplexing for a plurality of two-wire lines. The master modem includes an Ethernet interface <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of known form providing a 10BASE-T connection to the twisted pair wiring <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and providing (for example from a read-only memory within the interface <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>) a Network address for the master modem. The interface <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is connected to a control unit <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the master modem, to the input of a FIFO (first in, first out) buffer <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> for buffering downstream Ethernet frames supplied from the Network via the wiring <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and the interface <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, and to the output of a FIFO buffer <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> for supplying upstream Ethernet frames via the interface <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and the wiring <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to the Network. An output of the buffer <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is coupled via a modulator <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and a downstream demultiplexer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> (constituted by switches) to a respective one of the multiplexed two-wire lines <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> via a respective isolating transformer (TR) <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, the output of the modulator <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> providing a matched termination for the line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. An upstream multiplexer <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> (constituted by switches) has inputs also coupled to the lines <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> via the transformers <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, and has an output coupled via a high pass filter (HPF) <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> which provides a matched termination for the respective line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to which it is connected via the multiplexer <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. An output of the HPF <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is connected to an input of a demodulator <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> having an output connected to an input of the buffer <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. The transformers <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> can also provide a balun function between the balanced lines <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the demultiplexer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and multiplexer <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The demultiplexer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and multiplexer <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> are addressed by the control unit <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> via address lines <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> respectively to provide downstream frames to and to receive upstream frames from respective ones of the lines <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The addresses on the lines <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> are generally different for efficient data flow in the downstream and upstream directions, but they can be the same for example for loopback testing of a slave modem <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. To provide different logical buffers for frames in the buffers <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> associated with the respective lines <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the buffers <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> are also addressed via the address lines <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> respectively. A store <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> is also addressed with the upstream multiplexer address on the lines <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> to provide to the demodulator <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> stored data, such as echo coefficients and signal amplitude level, relating to the respective line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to facilitate fast acquisition (recognition of the preamble of a frame) by the demodulator <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. A store <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> is similarly addressed with the downstream demultiplexer address on the lines <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> to provide to the modulator <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> stored data to determine a signal transmission level and possibly frequency characteristics for the respective line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Information for the stores <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> is determined, and the stores are updated, by the control unit <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> in known manner. Control lines <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> are provided between the control unit <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and the modulator <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and demodulator <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> respectively for communicating control information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> illustrates a complementary form of a slave modem <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The slave modem includes an Ethernet interface <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of known form providing a 10BASE-T connection to the twisted pair wiring <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and providing (for example from a read-only memory within the interface <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) a Network address for the slave modem. The interface <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is connected to a control unit <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the slave modem, to the input of a FIFO buffer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> for buffering upstream Ethernet frames supplied from the TD via the wiring <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and the interface <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, and to the output of a FIFO buffer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> for supplying downstream Ethernet frames via the interface <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and the wiring <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to the TD. An output of the buffer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is coupled via a modulator <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, a current generator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and an isolating transformer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to the two-wire line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The transformer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, which can also provide a balun function for the balanced line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, is also coupled via a high pass filter <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and a demodulator <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> to an input of the buffer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The current generator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> provides a high output impedance to avoid loading of the line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and the HPF <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> provides a matched termination of the line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, so that these can both be connected to the line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> without any switching. This enables loopback testing of the line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> from the control unit <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Control lines are provided between the control unit <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the buffers <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, modulator <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, and demodulator <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> It can be appreciated that, apart from the functions related to the multiplexing and switching for a plurality of lines <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and the operation of the modems as described below, the master modem <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the slave modem <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are similar, and the arrangement of the slave modem shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> could also be used as a master modem for a single line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In each of the modems <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> the modulator, demodulator, and related functions are conveniently implemented in known manner using one or more DSPs (digital signal processors) with analog-digital conversion in known manner. DSPs can be conveniently controlled to provide an arbitrary number of different signal bandwidths for example as illustrated by the spectra <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. Conveniently the DSPs provide a common lower frequency limit of about 10 kHz for all of the signal bandwidths as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, with the different bandwidths being determined by the symbol or clock rate as described above. The particular modulation method that is used is relatively arbitrary, but conveniently the DSPs in the modems are programmed to select any of a plurality of modulation methods, for example 16QAM (quadrature amplitude modulation), QPSK (quadrature phase shift keying), and BPSK (binary phase shift keying), providing different numbers of bits per symbol. These particular methods and numbers are given only by way of example, and other modulation methods, such as VSB (vestigial sideband), carrierless amplitude-phase, and DMT (discrete multi-tone) modulation, may be used instead, numerous different numbers of bits per symbol may be used, and the signal bandwidths may be arbitrarily defined (e.g. with different low-frequency cutoffs) as desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The master and slave modems communicate Ethernet frames downstream (from the master modem <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to the slave modem <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>) and upstream (from the slave modem <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to the master modem <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>) in a manner described in detail below. Briefly, this communication involves half-duplex transmission using a collision avoidance protocol (ECAP) in which the master modem <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> has priority and control over the slave modem <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Thus the master modem <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> determines when to send information downstream via the line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and informs the slave modem when it is permitted to send information upstream via the line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. To facilitate these communications, the information sent via the line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> comprises not only the data packets of Ethernet frames for Network communications but also control packets downstream and response packets upstream between the master and slave modems. These packets are incorporated into ECAP frames examples of which are described below with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The control units <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in the master and slave modems perform the necessary conversions between the Ethernet frames and ECAP data frames, and generate and respond to the ECAP control and response frames. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> illustrates an ECAP data frame which comprises overhead information O/H, followed by an Ethernet frame in exactly the same form as described above with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, followed by a check sequence CHK. The O/H field for example consists of a few bytes comprising a preamble and start-of-frame (SOF) indication of a suitable form for the modulation method in use by the master and slave modems, possibly followed by other information such as an ECAP frame sequence number for frame identification in known manner (e.g. for identifying frames for acknowledgement or retransmission). The check sequence CHK conveniently comprises a CRC sequence which can be produced in exactly the same manner as the FCS field of the Ethernet frame, the CRC operating on all of the information in the ECAP frame following the SOF indication up to and including the FCS at the end of the Ethernet frame. Thus as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> the Ethernet fame is enveloped, intact and without any change, within the ECAP frame. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the preamble and SFD fields can be stripped from the Ethernet frame and only the remainder of the Ethernet frame (i.e. the data packet and FCS field) incorporated into the ECAP frame between the overhead field O/H and the check sequence CHK. In this case the preamble and SFD fields of the Ethernet frame are stripped for example by the control unit of whichever of the master and slave modems <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is sending the frame, and is reinserted by the control unit of the receiving one of the modems <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> for forwarding the Ethernet frame to the respective Ethernet interface. This reduces slightly the amount of information to be transmitted via the line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Further reductions are possible if for example the pad, used for increasing data packets of less than 46 bytes to the minimum data field size of an Ethernet frame, can also be identified, stripped prior to sending the remainder of the frame between the modems <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and reinserted at the receiving modem. However, it may be more desirable for the modems <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> always to communicate the entire data packet and FCS field of each Ethernet frame intact, to avoid risk of corrupting the Ethernet frame contents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Thus whereas transmission of undersized frames is not possible in a CSMA/CD arrangement because of the nature of the contention scheme (they are generally interpreted as collisions), in this ECAP scheme collisions are avoided by the protocol between the master and slave modems so that short frames are not only permitted but can be desirable because they reduce the amount of information that must be communicated via the line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> To this end, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> illustrates an ECAP control frame comprising a control packet to be communicated from the master modem <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to the slave modem <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The control frame comprises an initial overhead field O/H as described above, followed by a control packet described below, and the check field CHK providing a CRC sequence for all of the information in the ECAP frame following the SOF indication up to the end of the control packet. The control packet comprises destination and source address fields, a length/type field L/T, and a control field which is generally much shorter than the minimum 46 byte data field of an Ethernet frame and whose length is given by the contents of the field L/T. For such a control packet the destination and source addresses are the Network addresses of the slave modem <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the master modem <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Conversely, an ECAP response frame can have the same form as the control frame shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, except that it contains a response field instead of the control field and the destination and source addresses are exchanged because the response frame is communicated from the slave modem <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to the master modem <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Other ECAP frame formats can alternatively be provided to suit particular situations; for example for convenience or simplicity the control and response frames can have a fixed size and can be the same size as a data frame containing a minimum-size data packet. In addition, although as described here by way of example the control frames are separate from the data frames, control information can instead be incorporated into the ECAP data frames, desirably keeping the enveloped Ethernet frame contents intact, for example as an additional part of the overhead field O/H or between the CRC fields FCS and CHK. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The following description of an example of the collision avoidance protocol, with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, assumes for simplicity and clarity that the master modem <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> typically sends a single data frame followed by a control frame downstream, and then waits for a response from the slave modem <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and that the slave modem waits for these downstream frames and then typically sends a response frame followed by a single data frame upstream. It also assumes for simplicity that there is only one slave modem <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> connected to the line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Various modifications and extensions of this protocol, for example to accommodate multiple slave modems <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> connected to the same line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, can be contemplated and some variations are described later below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> illustrates a downstream transmitting flow chart for the master modem <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> illustrates an upstream receiving flow chart for the master modem <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, the master modem <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> being assumed here simply to alternate between the transmitting and receiving states for communications with a single slave modem <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. As already described, the master modem <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can provide multiplexed operations for a plurality of slave modems, so that in practice the transmitting and receiving processes can take place simultaneously and independently in a multiplexed manner for a plurality of slave modems. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> illustrates a downstream receiving and upstream transmitting flow chart for the slave modem <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The operations in the modems in each case take place under the control of the respective control unit <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and the master and slave modems differ in the manner in which these units operate as described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, in the transmitting sequence of the master modem <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> its control unit <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> initially determines in a decision <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> whether the downstream buffer <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> (for the respective line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and slave modem <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>) is empty. If not, i.e. if there is at least one Ethernet frame to be sent from the buffer <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, then at a block <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> the next frame to be sent downstream from the buffer <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is transmitted in an ECAP data frame as described above. At a block <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> the control unit <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> then sends a control frame as described above, and sets a timer for a response from the slave unit. In the event that the buffer <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is empty as determined in the decision <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, then in a decision <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> the control unit <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> determines whether or not to send a control frame, if so proceeds to the block <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> to send a control frame, and if not returns to the start of the transmitting sequence. The decision <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> whether or not to send a control frame may depend upon various parameters which are monitored by the control unit <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, such as the fill state of the upstream receiving buffer <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, the state of the slave modem and the fill state of its upstream transmitting buffer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and the time since the previous control frame was sent to the slave modem. The contents of the control frame can comprise, for example, a request (poll) for the slave modem to transmit a frame of data upstream, a request for retransmission by the slave modem of a previous frame that has not been received correctly as determined by its check field CHK, control information such as operating parameters for the slave modem, and/or a request for status information, such as the fills of the buffers <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, from the slave modem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, at a block <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> the control unit <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the slave modem <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> initially waits for a frame to be received from the master modem <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. This waiting, and the subsequent operation of the slave modem in response to a received frame and operation of the master modern, ensures that collisions on the line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are avoided by giving control of the ECAP frames on the line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> entirely to the master modem <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. In response to receipt of a downstream frame from the master modem <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, the control unit <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the slave modem determines in a decision <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> from the field CHK whether the frame has been received properly and, if not, at a block <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> sets a status flag to request retransmission of the frame and returns to the wait block <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. If the frame has been properly received the control unit <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> proceeds to a decision <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> In the decision <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> the control unit <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> determines whether or not the destination address in the received frame is the address of the slave modem, and hence whether the frame is a control frame or a data frame. If the frame is determined to be a data frame, then in a block <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> the control unit <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> sets a status flag for acknowledgement of the frame, and in a block <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> the data frame is stored in the buffer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and a return is made to the wait block <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> If in the decision <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> the frame is determined to be a control frame, then in a block <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> the control unit <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> generates and sends a response frame upstream to the master modem. The contents of the response frame depend on the nature of the received control frame and the status of the slave modem, but for example can include status information, an acknowledgement of the received data frame (based on the acknowledgement status flag), a request for retransmission of an incorrectly received frame (based on the retransmission status flag), and buffer fills of the buffers <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. In a decision <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight>, the control unit <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> then determines whether a data frame is to be sent upstream, i.e. whether the received downstream control frame included a retransmission request or a poll for an upstream data frame and such a data frame is available in the upstream transmission buffer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. If so, at a block <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> the control unit <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> sends the requested data frame from this buffer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> upstream to the master modem. After the block <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>, or if no upstream frame is to be sent as determined in the decision <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight>, a return is made to the wait block <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, after the downstream transmitting sequence described above with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> the control unit <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> in the master modem <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> waits, as shown by a block <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, for an upstream frame to be received or for the timer (set at block <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>) to time out. If an upstream frame is received, then in a decision <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> the control unit <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> determines from the field CHK whether the frame has been received properly and, if so, proceeds to a decision <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. In the event that the timer times out in the block <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> or the frame is incorrectly received as determined in the decision <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>, then in a block <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> the control unit <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> updates a record of the communications status of the master modem with the slave modem. This status record contains various parameters of the communications such as those already discussed, for example the status of acknowledgements and retransmission requests, buffer fills, and operating parameters of the modems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> In the decision <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> the control unit determines, from the destination address of the received upstream frame and in accordance with its expectations based on the status of the communications, whether this is a response frame (i.e. the destination address is the address of the master modem) as expected first from the slave modem, or a data frame for which a poll or retransmission request has been sent to the slave modem as described above, or whether the frame does not have the expected form (e.g. it is a data frame when a response frame is expected). In the latter case the communications status is updated in the block <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>, and the control unit <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> proceeds in a manner dependent upon the updated status. For example, from the block <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> the control unit returns from the upstream receiving sequence of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> to the downstream transmitting sequence of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, and can send a control frame requesting retransmission of an upstream frame for which there has been a timeout from the block <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, a CRC error as determined in the decision <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>, or an unexpected frame as determined in the decision <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> On receipt of an expected response frame, in a block <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> the communications status is updated accordingly, and in dependence upon a decision <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> either a return is made to the block <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> for a data frame expected following the response frame (a data frame is expected if it has been requested from the slave modem and the response frame has not indicated that the upstream transmitting buffer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is empty; the timer for the block <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> can be reset as desired) or the receiving sequence ends if no subsequent data frame is expected. On receipt of an expected data frame as determined in the decision <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, in a block <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> the control unit <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> sets a status flag for acknowledgement of the frame, and in a subsequent block <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight> the received data frame is stored in the upstream receiving buffer <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and the receiving sequence ends. As already described above, at the end of the upstream receiving sequence the control unit <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the master modem <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> returns to the start of the downstream transmitting sequence already described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The collision avoidance protocol as described above provides for an approximate one-to-one ratio of downstream and upstream Ethernet frames, and gives priority to the master modem and the transmission of downstream frames. This is desirable because the modem arrangement has no control over the supply from the Network of Ethernet frames incoming to the buffer <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, and it is desirable to avoid overflow of this buffer which would result in a loss of data frames. Such a data frame loss can be accommodated by the TCP/IP operating at Layers <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the OSI model, but this is preferably avoided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The same principles apply for upstream Ethernet frames incoming to the buffer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> from the TD <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, but in this case overflow of the buffer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> can be prevented by the Ethernet interface <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the slave modem <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, under the control of the control unit <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in the event that the buffer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is about to overflow, jamming the 10BASE-T connection on the wiring <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> by transmitting a dummy signal to it. As discussed in the introduction, jamming is a well-known process for ensuring that a collision detected at one device on a CSMA/CD LAN is also detected by all other devices on the LAN, but in this case the jamming is triggered differently, by the potential overflow of the buffer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The jam or artificially created collision on the wiring <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is detected by the TD <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> connected to this wiring, and the TD backs off for subsequent retransmission of the Ethernet frame in known manner. In this manner, a loss of upstream data frames due to overflow of the buffer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is avoided. The same situation can take place in the event that the wiring <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is connected to the bridge <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> on a subscriber LAN as described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, but in this case either the bridge <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> must be a learning bridge to avoid passing to the slave modem <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> via the wiring <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> subscriber LAN frames not intended for upstream transmission, or such a learning function must be incorporated into the slave modem itself, otherwise jamming of all frames on the subscriber LAN will occur when the buffer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is about to overflow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> To reduce the possibility of buffer overflow, especially of the buffer <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, the collision avoidance protocol described above can provide dynamic variation of the ratio of the numbers of downstream and upstream frames, for example in dependence upon the fills of the buffers. The buffer fills are monitored as described above by the control unit <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, either directly in the case of the master modem <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> or via status information in response frames from the slave modem <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. If the fill of the buffer <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is increasing, then the master modem can simply send a plurality of data frames downstream instead of each single data frame as described above with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, before sending the control frame to poll the slave modem for an upstream data frame, thereby increasing the downstream to upstream data frame ratio. Conversely, if the buffer <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is relatively empty and the buffer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is relatively full, the master modem can provide repeated polls for single upstream data frames without sending downstream data frames using the protocol exactly as described above, or more desirably the ECAP control frame poll can be arranged to indicate to the slave modem a number of data frames that it is requested to transmit upstream in response to particular polls, with the slave modem responding accordingly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> It can be appreciated from the description above that the collision avoidance protocol ensures that the modems <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> operate in a half-duplex manner for communications between them via the line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, with the total transmission capacity of the line being shared, preferably dynamically dependent upon buffer fills as described above, between the downstream and upstream directions of transmission. The protocol can be refined, from its basic form as described above, in various ways to maximize the efficiency with which the total transmission capacity is used. For example, such refinements can include provisions for sending multiple data frames successively in either direction as described above, concatenating or merging control and/or data frames sent in the same direction, and advancing the timing of downstream frame transmission from the master modem in view of the loop delay on the line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (which can be measured in known manner by the master modem) and the knowledge in the master modem control unit <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of what upstream frames are expected from the slave modem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> This total transmission capacity on the line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can also be varied dynamically by the master modem <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> in dependence upon monitored operating conditions, as explained further below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> As described above, the modulation and demodulation functions in the master and slave modems are desirably implemented using DSPs. A clock rate of the DSPs can be changed to vary the signal bandwidth as shown by the two different spectra <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. A high clock rate provides a corresponding large bandwidth, for example as shown by the spectrum <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, providing a high symbol transmission rate on the line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> between the modems <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. However, this involves greater susceptibility to noise (a large noise bandwidth) and greater signal attenuation (which is dependent on frequency). Conversely, a lower clock rate provides a smaller bandwidth, for example as shown by the spectrum <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, providing a lower symbol transmission rate on the line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with less susceptibility to noise and less signal attenuation. Considered generally, higher symbol rates on the line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> produce greater total transmission capacity and greater error rates, resulting in frames having to be retransmitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> As also described above, the control unit <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> in the master modem <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> determines from the check field CHK of each received upstream frame whether the frame has been received correctly, and can monitor a proportion of correct upstream frames received The control unit <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> can similarly monitor a proportion of correct downstream frames received by the slave modem <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> from information similarly available in the control unit <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the slave modem and communicated to the control unit <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> via the response frames. From such ongoing monitoring, the control unit <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> can determine dynamically whether the clock rate in current use for the DSPs is appropriate or should desirably be increased to increase the total transmission capacity on the line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or decreased to decrease the proportion of frames received in error. This can be determined either independently or in common for the upstream and downstream directions of transmission. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> For example, if the control unit determines that a high proportion, more than an upper threshold value of for example 95 to 99%, of frames are received correctly, then it can decide to increase the DSP clock rate and hence the total transmission capacity. To this end it generates a control frame which is sent from the master modem to the slave modem instructing the slave modem to adopt a new, higher, clock rate for future frames, the slave modem responds accordingly, and the master modem switches its own clock rate. Conversely, if the control unit determines that a low proportion, less than a lower threshold value of for example 50 to 75%, of frames are received correctly, then it can decide to decrease the DSP clock rate to reduce errors. To this end it generates a control frame which is sent from the master modem to the slave modem instructing the slave modem to adopt a new, lower, clock rate for future frames, the slave modem responds accordingly, and the master modem switches its own clock rate. It can be appreciated that the threshold levels can be determined to provide a desired hysteresis for changing the clock rate, and that they may be adaptively adjusted by the control unit <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> in dependence upon the results of previous changes in clock rate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The total transmission capacity is determined not only by the symbol transmission rate on the line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> but also by the number of bits per symbol, and hence by the modulation method that is used. As described above, the modem DSPs can provide any of a plurality of modulation methods, such as 16QAM, QPSK, and BPSK providing respectively 4 bits, 2 bits, and 1 bit per transmitted symbol. In a similar manner to that described above for dynamically varying the symbol transmission rate, the control unit <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> can also or instead dynamically vary the modulation method. A determination as to whether to change the symbol transmission rate and/or the modulation method can be made by the control unit <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> in dependence upon various parameters such as the current symbol transmission rate and modulation method, a history of these operating parameters, the error rate, and monitored characteristics of the line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> such as delay, signal levels, and echo parameters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> In any event, the dynamic variations discussed above enable the control unit <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> in the master modem <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to determine and use, at any particular time for any particular line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to which it is connected, a clock rate and modulation method to provide an optimal total transmission capacity on that line. It can be appreciated that this optimal capacity may well include a certain proportion of frames that are in error and must be retransmitted, and that this is accommodated by the collision avoidance protocol as already described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The total transmission capacity can vary over an extremely wide range. For example, for a short line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and under good conditions, the modulation method may be 16QAM and the clock rate 3 MHz to provide a total transmission capacity of the order of the 10BASE-T bit rate of 10 Mb/s. Conversely, for a long line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (it is observed here that the line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> must be unloaded to permit communication of signals at frequencies above the voice-band) and in poor conditions (e.g. in the presence of noise and crosstalk) the modulation method may be BPSK and the clock rate may be reduced to for example 30 kHz, thereby providing a total transmission capacity of about 25 kb/s (at for example 0.85 bits per Hertz to allow for excess bandwidth of the modem filters). However, it is noted that even this total transmission capacity is commensurate with the maximum bit rates of dial-up modems currently used to provide Network connections via conventional two-wire telephone lines. In practice, the total transmission capacity provided will be between these extremes, and will generally be substantially more than can be provided by currently used dial-up modems or on ISDN telephone lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> It is also noted that the master modem <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can be arranged to fall back to known modem communications methods in the event that it does not receive any ECAP response frames from a slave modem, so that the same master modem can operate alternatively with slave modems as described above or with conventional modems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> In use of the network access arrangement and protocol as described above, the master and slave modems and the line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> simply serve to communicate Ethernet frames in both directions transparently between the wiring <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the subscriber is provided with a Network connection without any dialling process, and hence without involving a telephone connection via the PSTN, in the same way (as seen by the Network and by the subscriber) as if the wiring <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> were directly interconnected. As described above, this Network connection is established in a manner that is dynamically variable to provide an optimum total transmission capacity, which can be shared in a dynamically variable and optimized ratio of upstream to downstream data frames, for any prevailing conditions such as the characteristics of the line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and noise and crosstalk levels. For short lines <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the total transmission capacity is comparable with the bit rate of 10BASE-T LANS, so that there is no inherent deterioration of performance for communication of Ethernet frames. In addition, it is observed that because the frames on the line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are communicated in burst mode, there is statistically less energy on the line than would be the case for continuous data transmission on the same line, so that crosstalk with other lines in the same cable is reduced. Furthermore, the same line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can simultaneously carry conventional telephone signals, so that provision of the network access arrangement to a telephone subscriber does not necessitate the provision of an additional or separate telephone line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Thus the use of the network access arrangement from a TD <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is substantially the same as if the TD <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> were connected directly via an Ethernet interface to the Ethernet switch <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The TD <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> runs conventional software which, for initial access to the Network, in known manner sends information packets in Ethernet frames upstream, these packets containing for example the Network address of the management device <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> as the destination address and the Network address of the TD <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> as the source address. The packets are routed via the Ethernet switch <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> in known manner to the device <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, and the switch <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> stores the address of the TD <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for subsequent direction of Ethernet frames addressed to this address to this TD. In known manner, the device <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> either recognizes the source address of the TD <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and provides a welcome message, or does not recognize it and initiates a registration process, and communications continue in known manner except that they take place via the modems <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> instead of via a direct connection as is known. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> In the embodiments described in detail above and as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> the slave modem <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is separate from the Ethernet interface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> connected to the TD <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and includes its own Ethernet interface and Network address. While this is convenient in the case that the slave modem is connected to a subscriber LAN via the wiring <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, it can be superfluous or undesirable in the event that the slave modem <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is connected to only a single TD <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, especially if the slave modem <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and Ethernet interface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are merged together into a combined unit that may be incorporated into the TD <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> as would be desirable for example for an entertainment device. Even in the case of a subscriber LAN, the bridge <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> can be considered as a terminal device in which the slave modem <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> could be incorporated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> It can be seen, therefore, that the manner in which the slave modem <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is ultimately connected to the TD <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is relatively arbitrary as far as this invention is concerned, it only being necessary that the information be converted or translated between the Ethernet frames to and from the buffers <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> of the slave modem and whatever form is required for the connection to the TD <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (for example, a PCM/CIA interface of known form), and that a Network address identify the TD, translator, and/or slave modem. Desirably, the slave modem <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the Ethernet interface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are merged into a combined unit, which can have a form for example as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, the combined unit has a similar form and operation to the slave modem <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> as described above with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, and the same reference numerals are used to denote similar parts, except that the Ethernet interface <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and wiring <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the slave modem of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, as well as the Ethernet interface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, are replaced by a data translator <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. The translator <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> has an interface <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> to the control unit <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and buffers <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, and an interface <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> to the TD <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, which are arranged and operate in the same manner as the corresponding parts of the known Ethernet interfaces <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> discussed above. Between these interfaces <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, the unit <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> includes a minimized subset of the known circuits and functions of the Ethernet interfaces <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> necessary to translate data between the TD interface <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> and the Ethernet frame buffers <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, and to provide a single Network address. This avoids the disadvantage of needing two Network addresses for the slave modem <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the Ethernet interface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> respectively as in the embodiments of the invention described above, but makes it necessary to distinguish between ECAP control frames for the control unit <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and ECAP data frames enveloping Ethernet frames containing data for the TD <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Where the control frames and data frames are separate ECAP frames, this distinction can conveniently be provided by using the L/T field of the Ethernet frame. For an ECAP control frame, the L/T field can contain a pre-assigned (and otherwise unused) type having a value greater than the maximum value of 1500 for an Ethernet fame, which is recognized by the control unit <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> so that the control frame is not forwarded to the translator <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, or in addition, as described above ECAP control information can be appended to Ethernet frames, for example in the overhead field O/H or between the FCS field of the enveloped Ethernet frame and the check field CHK of the ECAP frame. In either case the control information can be of a fixed size or it can include its own length field to indicate its size. The L/T field of the enveloped Ethernet frame is not changed, to avoid any risk of corrupting the Ethernet frame. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Although particular embodiments of the invention and various modifications have been described in detail, it should be appreciated that numerous other modifications, variations, and adaptations may be made without departing from the scope of the invention as defined in the claims. </paragraph>
