<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Production by Cultivation of Transformant </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The lipolytic enzyme of the invention may be produced by transforming a suitable host cell with a DNA sequence encoding the lipolytic enzyme, cultivating the transformed organism under conditions permitting the production of the enzyme, and recovering the enzyme from the culture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The host organism is preferably a eukaryotic cell, in particular a fungal cell, such as a yeast cell or a filamentous fungal cell, e.g. a strain of Aspergillus, Fusarium, Trichoderma or Saccharomyces, particularly <highlight><italic>A. niger, A. oryzae, F. graminearum, F. sambucinum, F. cerealis </italic></highlight>or <highlight><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></highlight>. The production of the lipolytic enzyme in such host organisms may be done by the general methods described in EP 238,023 (Novo Nordisk), WO 96/00787 (Novo Nordisk) or EP 244,234 (Alko). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Hybridization </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The hybridization is used to indicate that a given DNA sequence is analogous to a nucleotide probe corresponding to a DNA sequence of the invention. The hybridization conditions are described in detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Suitable conditions for determining hybridization between a nucleotide probe and a homologous DNA or RNA sequence involves presoaking of the filter containing the DNA fragments or RNA to hybridize in 5&times; SSC (standard saline citrate) for 10 min, and prehybridization of the filter in a solution of 5&times; SSC (Sambrook et al. 1989), 5&times; Denhardt&apos;s solution (Sambrook et al. 1989), 0.5% SDS and 100 &mgr;g/ml of denatured sonicated salmon sperm DNA (Sambrook et al. 1989), followed by hybridization in the same solution containing a random-primed (Feinberg, A. P. and Vogelstein, B. (1983) <highlight><italic>Anal. Biochem. </italic></highlight>132:6-13), <highlight><superscript>32</superscript></highlight>P-dCTP-labeled (specific activity&gt;1&times;10<highlight><superscript>9 </superscript></highlight>cpm/&mgr;g) probe for 12 hours at approx. 45&deg; C. The filter is then washed two times for 30 minutes in 2&times; SSC, 0.5% SDS at a temperature of at least 55&deg; C., more preferably at least 60&deg; C., more preferably at least 65&deg; C., even more preferably at least 70&deg; C., especially at least 75&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Molecules to which the oligonucleotide probe hybridizes under these conditions are detected using an x-ray film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Alignment and Identity </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The lipolytic enzyme and the nucleotide sequence of the invention may have identity to the disclosed sequences of at least 85%, particularly at least 90% or at least 95%, e.g. at least 98%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> For purposes of the present invention, alignments of sequences and calculation of identity scores were done using a Needleman-Wunsch alignment (i.e. global alignment), useful for both protein and DNA alignments. The default scoring matrices BLOSUM50 and the identity matrix are used for protein and DNA alignments respectively. The penalty for the first residue in a gap is &minus;12 for proteins and &minus;16 for DNA, while the penalty for additional residues in a gap is &minus;2 for proteins and &minus;4 for DNA. Alignment is from the FASTA package version v20u6 (W. R. Pearson and D. J. Lipman (1988), &ldquo;Improved Tools for Biological Sequence Analysis&rdquo;, PNAS 85:2444-2448, and W. R. Pearson (1990) &ldquo;Rapid and Sensitive Sequence Comparison with FASTP and FASTA&rdquo;, Methods in Enzymology, 183:63-98). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Lipase Activity (LU) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> A substrate for lipase is prepared an emulsion of 5% by volume of tributyrin (glycerin tributyrate) using 0.1% gum Arabic as emulsifier. The hydrolysis of tributyrin at 30&deg; C. at pH 7 is followed in a pH-stat titration experiment. One unit of lipase activity (1 LU) equals the amount of enzyme capable of releasing 1 &mgr;mol butyric acid/min at the standard conditions. 1 KLU&equals;1000 LU. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Use of Lipolytic Enzyme </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The lipolytic enzyme of the invention can be used in various industrial application of lipolytic enzymes, e.g. in baking, detergents, diglyceride synthesis (EP 307154), acidolysis, interesterification (WO 8802775), ester hydrolysis, oil degumming (JP-A 2-153997, U.S. Pat. No. 5,264,367), production of lysolecithin (JP patent 2794574, JP-B 6-087751) and in the process described in PCT/DK 00/00109. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Use in Baking </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The lipolytic enzyme of the invention can be used in the preparation of dough, bread and cakes, e.g. to improve the elasticity of the bread or cake. Thus, the lipolytic enzyme can be used in a process for making bread, comprising adding the lipolytic enzyme to the ingredients of a dough, kneading the dough and baking the dough to make the bread. This can be done in analogy with WO 9404035 and EP 585988. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Use in Detergent </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The variant may be used as a detergent additive, e.g. at a concentration (expressed as pure enzyme protein) of 0.001-10 (e.g. 0.01-1) mg per gram of detergent or 0.001-100 (e.g. 0.01-10) mg per liter of wash liquor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The detergent composition of the invention may for example be formulated as a hand or machine laundry detergent composition including a laundry additive composition suitable for pre-treatment of stained fabrics and a rinse added fabric softener composition, or be formulated as a detergent composition for use in general household hard surface cleaning operations. In a laundry detergent, the variant may be effective for the removal of fatty stains, for whiteness maintenance and for dingy cleanup. A laundry detergent composition may be formulated as described in WO 97/04079, WO 97/07202, WO 97/41212, PCT/DK WO 98/08939 and WO 97/43375. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The detergent composition of the invention may particularly be formulated for hand or machine dishwashing operations. e.g. as described in GB 2,247,025 (Unilever) or WO 99/01531 (Procter &amp; Gamble). In a dishwashing composition, the variant may be effective for removal of greasy/oily stains, for prevention of the staining/discoloration of the dishware and plastic components of the dishwasher by highly colored components and the avoidance of lime soap deposits on the dishware.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Construction of Expression Vector and Transformation into <highlight><italic>Aspergillus oryzae </italic></highlight></heading>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The cloned phospholipase gene in the TOPO vector, as well as pJVi9 (WO 97/47746) was cut with the restriction enzymes BamHI and XhoI. The pJVI9 vector and the phospholipase gene were purified from a 1% agarose gel, and ligated o/n. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The ligation was transformed into the <highlight><italic>E.coli </italic></highlight>strain DH10b, and transformants were isolated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> DNA preparations where made using the Qiagen minispinprep kit and the clones where verified by sequencing using 19670 and 19671 primer (SEQ ID NO: 12 and 13). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The resulting plasmid was transformed into the <highlight><italic>Aspergillus oryzae </italic></highlight>strain Jal125 (WO 97/35956) using the following method: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Transformation of Aspergillus oryzae (General Procedure) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> 100 ml of YPD (Sherman et al., (1981), Methods in Yeast Genetics, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory) are inoculated with spores of <highlight><italic>A. oryzae </italic></highlight>and incubated with shaking for about 24 hours. The mycelium is harvested by filtration through miracloth and washed with 200 ml of 0.6 M MgSO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>. The mycelium is suspended in 15 ml of 1.2 M MgSO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, 10 mM NaH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>PO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, pH 5.8. The suspension is cooled on ice and 1 ml of buffer containing 120 mg of Novozym&reg; 234 is added. After 5 min., 1 ml of 12 mg/ml BSA (Sigma type H25) is added and incubation with gentle agitation continued for 1.5-2.5 hours at 37&deg; C. until a large number of protoplasts is visible in a sample inspected under the microscope. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The suspension is filtered through miracloth, the filtrate transferred to a sterile tube and overlayed with 5 ml of 0.6 M sorbitol, 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. Centrifugation is performed for 15 min. at 1000 g and the protoplasts are collected from the top of the MgSO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>cushion. 2 volumes of STC (1.2 M sorbitol, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM CaCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) are added to the protoplast suspension and the mixture is centrifuged for 5 min. at 1000 g. The protoplast pellet is resuspended in 3 ml of STC and repelleted. This is repeated. Finally, the protoplasts are resuspended in 0.2-1 ml of STC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> 100 &mgr;l of protoplast suspension are mixed with 5-25 &mgr;g of p3SR2 (an <highlight><italic>A. nidulans </italic></highlight>amdS gene carrying plasmid described in Hynes et al., Mol. and Cel. Biol., Vol. 3, No. 8, 1430-1439, August 1983) and 5 &mgr;g of the pJVI9-phospholipase plasmid in 10 &mgr;l of STC. The mixture is left at room temperature for 25 min. 0.2 ml of 60% PEG 4000 (BDH 29576), 10 mM CaCl<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 is added and carefully mixed (twice) and finally 0.85 ml of the same solution are added and carefully mixed. The mixture is left at room temperature for 25 min., spun at 2.500 g for 15 min. and the pellet is resuspended in 2 ml of 1.2M sorbitol. After one more sedimentation the protoplasts are spread on minimal plates (Cove, (1966), Biochem. Biophys. Acta 113, 51-56) containing 1.0 M sucrose, pH 7.0, 10 mM acetamide as nitrogen source and 20 mM CsCl to inhibit background growth. After incubation for 4-7 days at 37&deg; C. spores are picked, suspended in sterile water and spread for single colonies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> 12 independent transformants from the pJVI9-phorpholipase transformations were isolated on minimal plates (Cove, (1966), Biochem. Biophys. Acta 113, 51-56) containing 1.0 M sucrose, pH 7.0, 10 mM acetamide as nitrogen source and 20 mM CsCI to inhibit background growth, and at the same time inoculated into a 96-well microtiter dish containing 200 &mgr;l minimal media of 1*vogel, 2% maltose (e.g., <highlight><italic>Methods in Enzymology</italic></highlight>, Vol. 17 p. 84) in each well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> After three days of incubation at 34&deg; C., media from the cultures in the microtiter dish were assayed for lipase activity. A 10 &mgr;l aliquot of media from each well was added to a microtiter well containing 200 &mgr;l of a lipase substrate of 0.018% p-nitrophenylbutyrate, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mM CaCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, 50 mM Tris pH 7.5. Activity was assayed spectrophotometrically at 15-second intervals over a five minute period, using a kinetic microplate reader (Molecular Device Corp., Sunnyvale Calif.), using a standard enzymology protocol (e.g., <highlight><italic>Enzyme Kinetics, Paul C. Engel, ed., </italic></highlight>1981, Chapman and Hall Ltd.) Briefly, product formation is measured during the initial rate of substrate turnover and is defined as the slope of the curve calculated from the absorbance at 405 nm every 15 seconds for 5 minutes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> This procedure was repeated and spores of the best producing transformants after the second re-isolation were stored as a defined transformant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> <highlight><italic>A. oryzae </italic></highlight>JaL 125 (WO 97/35956) is derived from <highlight><italic>Aspergillus oryzae </italic></highlight>IFO 4177 available from Institute for Fermention, Osaka; 17-25 Juso Hammachi 2-Chome Yodogawa-ku, Osaka, Japan, having the alkaline protease gene named &ldquo;alp&rdquo; (described by Murakami K et al., (1991), Agric. Biol. Chem. 55, p. 2807-2811) deleted by a one step gene replacement method (described by G. May in &ldquo;Applied Molecular Genetics of Filamentous Fungi&rdquo; (1992), p. 1-25. Eds. J. R. Kinghorn and G. Turner; Blackie Academic and Professional), using the <highlight><italic>A. oryzae </italic></highlight>pyrG gene as marker. </paragraph>
