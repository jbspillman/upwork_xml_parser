<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to drug delivery devices, and more specifically relates to disposable, pre-fillable drug cartridge for use with a reusable body portion of an injection device for injecting drugs or medicaments into patients which are commonly known in the field as pens. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Hypodermic syringes are used to deliver selected doses of medication to patients. The prior hypodermic syringe includes a syringe barrel having opposed proximal and distal ends. A cylindrical chamber wall extends between the ends and defines a fluid receiving chamber. The proximal end of the syringe barrel is substantially open and receives a plunger in sliding fluid tight engagement. The distal end of the syringe barrel includes a passage communicating with the chamber. A needle cannula may be mounted to the distal end of the syringe barrel, such that the lumen of the needle cannula communicates with the passage and the chamber of the syringe barrel. Movement of the plunger in a proximal direction draws fluid through the lumen of the needle cannula and into the chamber. Movement of the plunger in a proximal-to-distal direction urges fluid from the chamber and through the lumen of the needle cannula. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Medication to be injected with the prior hypodermic syringe often is stored in a vial having a pierceable elastomeric seal. Medication in the vial is accessed by piercing the elastomeric seal with the needle cannula. A selected dose of the medication may be drawn into the chamber of the syringe barrel by moving the plunger a selected distance in a proximal direction. The needle cannula may be withdrawn from the vial, and the medication may be injected into a patient by moving the plunger in a distal direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Some medication, such as insulin is self-administered. The typical diabetes patient will require injections of insulin several times during the course of a week or day. The required dose of insulin will vary from patient to patient, and for each patient may vary during the course of the day and from day to day. Usually, each diabetes patient will establish a regimen that is appropriate for his or her own medical condition and for his or her lifestyle. The regimen typically includes some combination of a slow or medium acting insulin and a faster acting insulin. Each of these regimens may require the diabetes patient to periodically self-administer insulin in public locations, such as places of employment or restaurants. The required manipulation of the standard hypodermic syringe and vial can be inconvenient and embarrassing in these public environments. Examples of syringes are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,250,037 (Bitdinger) and 5,667,495 (Bitdinger), and an example of a filler for mixing insulins is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,542,760 (Chanoch), the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Medication delivery pens have been developed to facilitate the self-administration of medication. An example of one such medication delivery pen is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,279,585 (Balkwill), which includes a vial holder into which a vial of insulin or other medication may be received, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. The vial holder is an elongate generally tubular structure with proximal and distal ends. The distal end of the vial holder includes mounting means for engaging a double-ended needle cannula. The proximal end also includes mounting means for engaging a driver and dose setting apparatus as explained further below. A disposable vial for use with the vial holder includes a distal end having a pierceable elastomeric seal that can be pierced by one end of a double-ended needle cannula. The proximal end of this vial includes a plunger slidably disposed in fluid tight engagement with the cylindrical wall of the vial. This medication delivery pen is used by inserting the vial of medication into the vial holder. A pen body then is connected to the proximal end of the vial holder. The pen body includes a dose setting apparatus for designating a dose of medication to be delivered by the pen and a driving apparatus for urging the plunger of the vial distally for a distance corresponding to the selected dose. Other examples of pens are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,645,534 (Chanoch), 5,582,598 (Chanoch) and 5,569,214 (Chanoch), the disclosure of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The user of the pen mounts a double-ended needle cannula to the distal end of the vial holder such that the proximal point cannula of the needle cannula pierces the elastomeric seal on the vial as described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,549,575 (Giambattista et. al.), the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. The user then selects a dose and operates the pen to urge the plunger distally to deliver the selected dose. The user then removes and discards the needle cannula, and keeps the medication delivery pen in a convenient location for the next required medication administration. The medication in the vial will become exhausted after several such administrations of medication. The user then separates the vial holder from the pen body. The empty vial may then be removed and discarded. A new vial can be inserted into the vial holder, and the vial holder and pen body can be reassembled and used again as explained above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The above described reusable medication delivery pen is effective and much more convenient for self-administration of medication than the typical hypodermic syringe and separate medication vial. However, it has been found that there is a need for additional features and improvements for such a medication delivery pen. For example, with the increased use of pens for self-injection of drugs other than insulin, there is a need to prevent cross-use of insulin pens with other drugs and/or cross-use of drug cartridges with other pens. The problems associated with cross-use could also pose a potential hazard, where the dose dials of the pens are different, which might result in the administration of the wrong dosage of the drug. This is particularly hazardous where an overdose of insulin could lead to hypoglycemia and ER treatment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Thus, there has been a need for a pen, as well as a drug cartridge assembly, which would eliminate the problems and limitations associated with the prior devices discussed above, most significant of the problems being cross-use of the pen with other drug cartridge assemblies and/or cross-use of the drug cartridge assembly with other pens. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In contrast to the prior devices discussed above, it has been found that a pen particularly suited for use in reducing or otherwise eliminating cross-use can be constructed in accordance with the present invention. Specifically, the pen and the drug cartridge assembly of the present invention are keyed, i.e., they have a connection interface which mechanically prevents the cross-use of cartridge assemblies among designated pens by, for example, using matching threads, bayonets or snap fits on the pen and the holding sleeve of the drug cartridge assembly. Also, the cartridge assembly can have an embedded drug cartridge, not readily separable from each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to improve the design of the drug cartridge and holder sleeve so that they are a single integral unit for containing the drug, with a rubber septum for multiple needle penetrations along with a standard thread to attach the pen needle. On the far end of the pen needle thread, a connection interface prevents connection to pens other than the one for which use of the drug container is designed. In this way, the drug cartridge assembly will have minimal dead space and an insert molded rubber septum.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S) </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The medication delivery pen of the present invention is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 5</cross-reference>, with the pen being generally designated <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the pen includes a pen body assembly <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a cartridge assembly <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and a cap <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, with the cartridge assembly being situated between the body assembly and the cap <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and typically having sufficient medication for several doses. The pen body assembly and the cartridge assembly are keyed, i.e., they have a connection interface which mechanically prevents the cross-use of cartridges among designated pens by, for example, threadedly engaged by corresponding threads and grooves, bayonet threads and grooves, snap fits or a pair of lugs that mate in a reverse Luer-lock manner. In addition, all of these elements have a generally cylindrical configuration and are arranged coaxially from opposed proximal and distal ends <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the pen <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> respectively to define a generally cylindrical housing which can easily be handled by a patient or medical attendant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, and in greater detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the body assembly <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is used to set a desired dose of medication to be delivered by the pen <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and includes an advancing member preferably in the form of a lead screw <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> with a distal end <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> movable in the distal direction based on the dose set by a dose setting mechanism within the pen body <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The dose setting mechanism determines the distance through which lead screw <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is to be moved during the injection of medication by the pen <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. It is understood, however, that variations from this preferred embodiment may be provided, and are considered to be within the scope of the subject invention. Particularly, the specific construction of the pen body <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, including the mechanisms for advancing the lead screw, may include those, for example, disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,279,585 (Balkwill), 5,279,586 (Balkwill), 5,549,575 (Giambattista et al.), 5,569,214 (Chanoch), 5,582,598 (Chanoch) and 5,645,534 (Chanoch), and co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/314,179 (Chanoch et. al.), the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. Accordingly, the particular pen body is not essential to the present invention and is merely a matter of choice. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and in greater detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, the cartridge assembly <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is divided into two parts, i.e., an upper vial retainer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and a lower vial retainer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, with the lower vial retainer defining a vial retaining cavity <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> formed in the lower vial retainer. As explained further herein, one end <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>A of the upper vial retainer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is preferably dimensioned and configured to threadedly engage one end <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>A of the lower vial retainer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the other end <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>B of the lower vial retainer is configured to securely but releasably engage a needle cannula assembly (not shown). The particular needle cannula assembly is not essential to the present invention and may include the type disclosed in co-pending U.S. patent application No. (P4059) filed on Sep. 12, 1997 and entitled &ldquo;PEN NEEDLE ASSEMBLY,&rdquo; the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. The upper and lower retainers <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> both are described in greater detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The cartridge assembly <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 34 and 5</cross-reference>, includes a drug vial or cartridge <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, with the cavity <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> dimensioned and configured to securely receive and retain the drug cartridge therein. The drug cartridge <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> includes a generally tubular barrel <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> with a distal end <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>A defined by an inwardly converging shoulder <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and an open proximal end <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>B. A smaller diameter neck <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> projects distally from the shoulder <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the barrel <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, and is provided with a large diameter annular bead (not shown) extending circumferentially thereabout at the extreme distal end of the neck. A pierceable and resealable elastomeric seal or septum <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is securely mounted across the open distal end defined by the neck <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The seal <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is held in place by a metallic sleeve <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> which is crimped around the circumferential bead at the distal end of the neck <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Medication is pre-filled into the drug cartridge <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and is retained therein by an elastomeric stopper or plunger <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The plunger <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is in sliding fluid-tight engagement with the tubular wall of the barrel <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Distally directed forces on the plunger <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> urge the medication from the pen as explained further below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The portion of the lower retainer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> defining the cavity <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is of substantially uniform diameter which is slightly greater than the diameter of the vial barrel <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The interior of the upper vial retainer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> includes an inwardly extending annual portion or stop <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> dimensioned to prevent the drug cartridge <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> from moving within the vial retainers <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. In this way, when the drug cartridge <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is inserted into the cavity <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the vial retainers <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> threadedly engaged, the drug cartridge <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is securely held in the cavity <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> at the open proximal end <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>B of the tubular barrel <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> by the annual stop <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. More particularly, the neck <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and crimped metallic sleeve <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the drug cartridge <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are inserted in a proximal to distal direction into the open proximal end of the lower retainer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> with the crimped metallic sleeve <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> eventually passing entirely into the lower retainer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, which will require entry of the crimped metallic sleeve into the portion thereof for mounting the needle cannula assembly. Then, with the vial retainers <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> threadedly engaged, the open proximal end <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the drug vial <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> abuts the stops <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the upper vial retainer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Preferably, when using standard drug vials or cartridges <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the vial retainers <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are permanently secured to one another by glue, locking threads or other fastening means. In this way, the cartridge assembly <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with the drug vial <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> secured therein may disposed of after being used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The pen body assembly <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> includes an array of threads <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> for threaded engagement with the threaded other end <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>B of the upper vial retainer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and when threadedly engaged, the plunger <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is disposed in sliding fluid tight engagement in the cartridge assembly <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the lead screw <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> initially is disposed substantially adjacent the plunger <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the drug cartridge <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The portion of drug cartridge <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> between the plunger <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and the seal <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is filled with a medication <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. In this way, advancement of the plunger <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> causes the medication <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to be forced from the drug cartridge <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> through the needle cannula </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the pen body assembly <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is reusable and the drug cartridge <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in the cartridge assembly <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> will contain a volume of medication <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> sufficient for administration of several doses. After exhaustion of the medication <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, the cartridge assembly <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> will be threadedly disengaged from pen body assembly <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the drug cartridge <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> discarded. A new assembly containing a drug cartridge may then be mounted to the reusable pen body assembly <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The assembled reusable pen body assembly <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and cartridge assembly <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be stored until a selected dose of medication is required. Just prior to use, a needle cannula assembly may be threadedly engaged to distal end <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>B of cartridge assembly <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. This threaded engagement will cause a proximal tip of a needle cannula to the pierce the seal <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and provide communication with medication <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> A desired dose of medication may be set by rotating a dose knob <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> located at the distal end <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the pen which will cause advancement of the lead screw <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> into the cavity <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the cartridge assembly <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. When the desired dose is set, injection is achieved by merely pushing on actuator button <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and the lead screw <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> will be advanced axially into cartridge assembly <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. This axial advancement of lead screw <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> causes distal end <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> thereof to come in contact with the plunger <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and urge the plunger distally into the drug cartridge <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and hence causes the medication <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to be injected through the needle cannula. Injection will be terminated when the dose knob <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is fully depressed into engagement with the pen body assembly <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Upon completion of the injection, the needle cannula assembly may be disengaged from the cartridge assembly <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and safely discarded. The cap <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be mounted over cartridge assembly <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and the pen <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be stored or carried in a convenient location until the next dose of medication is required. A subsequent dose of medication will be set in exactly the manner as described above. However, for such a subsequent dose, the plunger <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> will be in a partly advanced position as a starting point. Dose setting and injections can be carried out until all of medication <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> has been used. The cartridge assembly <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may then be threadedly disengaged from pen body assembly <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and slidably separated from the lead screw <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and discarded in order to be replaced as described above. </paragraph>
