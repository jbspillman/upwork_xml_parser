<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an image display apparatus and a driving method thereof, and particularly to an image display apparatus and a driving method thereof which are suitable for displaying an image according to a multi-tone digital signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, there is known the following image display apparatus. A plurality of signal lines and a plurality of scanning lines are arranged in a matrix shape in a display region for displaying an image. The pixels connected to the signal lines and the scanning lines through the switch elements are provided in the respective regions near the intersections of the signal lines and the scanning lines. The scanning circuit for driving the scanning lines and the driving circuit for driving the signal lines are provided in the non-display region. The driving circuit is constructed to receive a six-bit 64-gradation digital signal and to generate a 64-gradation voltage according to this digital signal as disclosed in Extended Abstracts of the 1997 International Conference on Solid State Devices and Materials, pp.348-349, FIG. 2<highlight><italic>n</italic></highlight>, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> More specifically, this driving circuit includes a shift register, a data bus, two latches, and a DA converter circuit. That is, the data bus for transferring the six-bit binary data is provided between the shift register and one of the latches, which is connected to the data bus. In this case, the latch for driving one signal line has six signal paths which have their input sides connected to the respective lines of the data bus. In other words, the data bus and the one latch are connected through six lines. The 6-bit binary data fed on the six lines of the data bus are stored in the one latch in response to the latch pulse produced from the shift register. After the latch is all filled with the data, the data stored in the one latch is transferred in response to the latch pulse to the other latch, where it is stored. The data stored in the other latch is held until data is again latched. The data stored in the other latch is converted in the DA converter into one of the 64 different gradation voltages. The converted gradation voltage is produced on the signal line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> When the driving circuit is incorporated in the image display apparatus, the increase of the display gradation number of the image display apparatus (namely, the bit number of data) will result in the expansion of the region in which the driving circuit is formed in accordance with the increase of the number of the data lines. The increase of the region in which the driving circuit is formed in accordance with the increase of the display gradation number, however, results in the expansion of the non-display region. Thus, the area in which the driving circuit is formed must be limited. For example, in order to attain the image display apparatus having the definition of 200 pixels/inch with the pixels of the vertical color stripes, the interval of the signal lines is required to be 2.54 mm&divide;200&divide;3 (colors)&cong;42 &mgr;m. The circuit for driving one signal line must be disposed in this interval. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> However, when the image display apparatus having the definition of 200 pixels/inch is tried to be constructed according to the conventional construction, the interval between the signal lines cannot be achieved as required because of the large number of the wiring lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> That is, the prior image display apparatus is constructed in the following manner in order to transfer the 6-bit binary data to the DA converter. The data bus and the one latch are connected through the six lines, the one latch and the other latch are connected through the six lines, and the other latch and the DA converter are connected through the six lines. In addition, the image display apparatus uses two types of metals (namely, the gate metal used for the gate electrode of the thin film transistor (hereinafter, referred to as &ldquo;TFT&rdquo;) and the wiring metal connected to the source and drain electrodes of the TFT. It should be generally avoided to use three or more types of metals because of increasing the number of the processing steps, and hence the cost. Therefore, the six wiring lines (longitudinal lines) for connecting the data bus and the DA converter between which the two latches are provided, and the group of the lateral gradation voltage lines arranged to intersect the longitudinal lines at the DA converter are formed as two separate wiring layers. As a result, the six longitudinal lines cannot be overlapped each other, so that they are obliged to be formed in parallel. Accordingly, when the space and the wiring line are selected to be 4 &mgr;m and 4 &mgr;m according to the layout rule, the six wiring lines need the total width of (4&plus;4)&times;6 (lines)&equals;48 pm, which thus exceeds the required line width of 42 pm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the number of the TFTs is greatly affected by the increase of the gradation number. When the bit number of data is k, the DA converter alone needs the arrangement of the TFTs, the number of which is k&times;2<highlight><superscript>k </superscript></highlight>(e.g., 384 when k is 6). In addition, in order to provide two k-bit latches, it is necessary to use the layout rule of 1 pm or below, which is actually impractical. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Also, the power consumption of the driving circuit incorporated in the image display apparatus is required to be as small as possible. That is, the power consumption of the image display apparatus greatly affects the operating time of the battery-powered product with this display apparatus used. The data bus consumes power as a part of the power consumption of the driving circuit. The data bus functions to transmit the input data from the outside to the latches. The data bus is one of the wiring lines having the fast data transmission rate and the large power consumption. The power consumption of this data bus is proportional to the wiring capacitance, the number of the data changes, and the square of the signal voltage. Therefore, the power consumption of the data bus can be effectively reduced by decreasing the wiring capacitance, the number of the data changes, and the signal voltage. The wiring intersection capacitance of the wiring capacitance of the data bus is the great part. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Here, it is assumed that &ldquo;k&rdquo; represents the number of the wiring lines of the data bus. (k&minus;1) (five when six bits are used) intersections per signal line are necessary as the wiring intersections of the data buses in order for the data from the data bus to be taken out at the one latch as in the prior art. Regarding the number of the data changes (the number of times that data is changed from &ldquo;0&rdquo; to &ldquo;1&rdquo; or from &ldquo;1&rdquo; to &ldquo;0&rdquo;), when &ldquo;k&rdquo; is assumed to be the number of the wiring lines of the data bus, the average data changes per data is k/2 (3 when six bits are used), and the maximum number of the data changes is k (6 when six bits are used). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In addition, since the decoder means is used to select one single gradation voltage line, the number of the switch drive lines on which data is changed is maximum &ldquo;2&rdquo;, so that the number of times that data is changed is reduced. Thereby, even if the capacitance between the wiring lines is charged or discharged each time data is changed, the power consumption can be lowered by the reduction of the number of times that data is changed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Moreover, when the multi-tone images are displayed, the intersection wiring lines (i.e., the intersection wiring line capacitance) can be reduced, so that the power consumption on the switch drive lines for transmitting the fast signals can be reduced.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> One embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to drawings. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a diagram showing the construction of the main part of an image display apparatus according to one embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, on an insulating substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, there are formed a shift register <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a decoder <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a DA converter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, a scanning circuit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and a display region <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. This display region <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is formed as a region for displaying the high-definition multi-tone image. A plurality of signal lines S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and a plurality of scanning lines G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and G<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are disposed in the display region <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> in a matrix shape. Pixel TFTs <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> functioning as switch elements, and pixels <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are formed in the respective regions near the intersections of the signal lines and the scanning lines. The gate electrodes of the pixel TFTs <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are connected to the scanning lines G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and G<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, their source electrodes are connected to the signal lines S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and their drain electrodes are connected to the pixels <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> as illustrated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, six signal lines, two scanning lines, 6&times;2 pixel TFTs <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and 6&times;2 pixels <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are shown for the sake of simple explanation. However, these numbers are actually dependent on the number of the pixels <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. For example, when the display amount information of the image display apparatus corresponds to the color VGA, each of the numbers of the pixels <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the pixel TFTs <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are 640&times;480&times;3 (red, green and blue). Thus, the numbers of the signal lines and the scanning lines are 640&times;3 (red, green and blue) and 480, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> In the non-display region other than the display region <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, there are formed the scanning circuit for sequentially supplying the scanning pulses to the scanning lines G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and G<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and the shift register <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the decoder <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the DA converter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> as the driving circuits for driving the signal lines S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The DA converter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> has n gradation voltage lines LV<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-LVn as a group of gradation voltage lines, 2&times;n switch drive lines D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to Dn-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to Dn-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, trigger lines Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-Q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and output lines X<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-X<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> formed in order to convert the multi-tone gradation data to the analogue gradation voltages. The switch drive lines D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to Dn-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to Dn-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are connected to the output ends of the decoder <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the trigger lines Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-Q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are connected to the output ends of the register <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and the output lines X<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-X<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are connected to the signal lines S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The positional relation between the switch drive lines and the gradation voltage lines is such that when an arbitrary natural number i satisfies the condition of i&lE;n, switch drive lines Di-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and Di-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are disposed on both sides of the i-th gradation voltage line LVi to run in parallel with the voltage line. In other words, two switch drive lines are provided on both sides of each gradation voltage line in order that the region between the switch drive lines can be effectively used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> In addition, the trigger lines Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-Qn are disposed to intersect the switch drive lines, and two output lines are provided in parallel with each trigger line. Switch circuits SW are provided near the intersections of the switch drive lines or the gradation voltage lines to the trigger lines Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-Q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> or the output lines X<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-X<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> as illustrated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Different voltages V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-Vn as the gradation voltages corresponding to the display gradations are applied on the gradation voltage lines LV<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-LVn, respectively. Each of the gradation voltage lines is made of a low-resistivity wiring material such as aluminum or copper, and one end of each of the gradation voltage lines is connected to voltage generation means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> This voltage generation means may be n voltage sources the number of which is equal to the gradation number, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, for example. Alternatively, it may be the following voltage sources as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. A plurality of ladder resistors <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are connected in series between the voltage sources which generate the voltages V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and Vn, so that the difference voltage between the voltages V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and Vn are divided. The voltages V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and Vn and the divided voltages are applied to the gradation voltage lines LV<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-LVn as the gradation voltages V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-Vn, respectively. The order in which the gradation voltage lines LV<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-LVn are arranged and the order in which the voltages V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-Vn are applied are particularly not limited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The switch circuit SW includes an n-channel TFT tr<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, an n-channel TFT tr<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and a condenser (electrostatic capacity) Cm. The TFT tr<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> functioning as the first thin film transistor has the gate electrode connected to the trigger line Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the source electrode connected to the gradation voltage line D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and the drain electrode connected to one end of the condenser Cm. Thereby, the TFT tr<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> becomes conductive in synchronism with the trigger signal transmitted on the trigger line Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and allows the data on the switch drive line D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (switch drive signal) to be sampled by the condenser Cm. The condenser Cm is used as storage means for storing one-bit data, and has the other end connected to the gradation voltage line LV<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, or substantially grounded on an AC basis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> When the condition of substantially AC grounding cannot be obtained, the other end of the condenser Cm can be connected to a ground line <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> instead of the gradation voltage line LV<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The drain electrode of the TFT tr<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is also connected to the gate electrode of the TFT tr<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> functioning as the second thin film transistor. The source and drain electrodes of the TFT tr<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are connected to the gradation voltage line LV<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the output line X<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, respectively. Thereby, the TFT tr<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> functions as the switch controlled on/off according to the data sampled in the condenser Cm. In other words, the TFT tr<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is turned ON (conductive) when the high voltage is applied to the condenser Cm, and turned OFF (nonconductive) when the low voltage is applied to the condenser Cm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The switch circuit SW functions as the following switch means. When the trigger signal is applied, the switch means selects the specified gradation voltage line LV<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in response to the data (switch drive signal) from the switch drive line. Then, the switch means supplies the gradation voltage V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> from the specified gradation voltage line LV<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the signal line S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> via the output line X<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The switch circuits arranged in a matrix shape at all the intersections of the output lines X<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-X<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the switch drive lines D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to Dn-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to Dn-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are similarly constructed as mentioned above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The decoder <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is constructed as the decoder means which produces the switch drive signal for selecting any gradation voltage line according to the digital multi-tone image data (n-bit image data, for example, image data of six-bit 64 gradations). The decoder <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in this embodiment has two separate data lines Data-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and Data-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from which the image data is supplied so that data of &ldquo;1&rdquo; (switch drive signal) can be fed to two switch drive lines according to the multi-tone image data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> In other words, the decoder <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has two decoders <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. When the high-gradation image data are supplied from the data lines Data-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and Data-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the input terminals A-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and A-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the decoders <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> produce &ldquo;1&rdquo; signal (switch drive signal) at only a single output terminal of each of two separate output terminals Y<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to Yn-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and Y<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to Yn-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and &ldquo;0&rdquo; signal at the other output terminals according to the logic shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Here, &ldquo;1&rdquo; means the high voltage, and &ldquo;0&rdquo; means the low voltage. The input in is binary data. Although the data inputting to the input in is expressed by 1 through n for the sake of better understanding, it may be any n different values such as figures of 0 through (n&minus;1). In addition, although two separate input terminals A-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and A-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are provided as the input terminals of the decoder <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a separator may be provided before the input terminals of the decoders <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> so that a single input terminal can be effective. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Although the decoder <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is provided on one side, the decoders <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be provided on both sides of the DA converter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, respectively. In addition, the decoder <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> may be provided as an external IC <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> on the outside of the insulating substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> so that the external IC <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> can be connected via a flexible cable (FPC) <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to the insulating substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. Also, the external IC <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> may be mounted directly on the surface of the insulating substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The shift register <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as trigger signal output means for sequentially producing the trigger signals in synchronism with the image data is constructed using inverters, clocked inverters and AND gates, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, for example. The inverters, the clocked inverters and the AND gates can be constructed by circuits using TFTs, as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>C, respectively. The shift register <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> responds to a clock CK, a reverse-phase clock CKN and a start pulse ST to sequentially generate the trigger signals (trigger pulses) q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> from the AND gates. Although the trigger pulses q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are produced in turn from the shift register <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the order in which the trigger pulses are generated depends on the relation between the input data and the signal lines, and it is thus particularly not limited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The scanning circuit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is constructed using the similar circuits as is the shift register <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, for example, and is constructed as scanning means for sequentially producing the scanning pulse signals on the scanning lines G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and G<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> The n-channel TFTs are used for the switch circuits SW of the DA converter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> as described above. However, the mixture of the switch circuits SW using the n-channel TFTs, and the switch circuits SWp using the p-channel TFTs can be used to construct the DA converter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. In other words, when the gradation voltage of the gradation voltage line LVi is relatively lower than the signal voltage of the switch drive line Di, the signal source voltage to the switch drive lines can be reduced by using the n-channel TFT tr<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, when the gradation voltage of the gradation voltage LVj is relatively higher than the signal voltage of the switch drive line Dj, the signal source voltage to the switch drive lines can be reduced by using the p-channel TFTs tr<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>p. In this case, when the switch circuits SWp using the p-channel TFTs are connected to the decoder <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, an inverter <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> can be provided between the decoder <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the switch circuit SWp in order to invert the output logic of the decoder <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, or the structure for inverting the logic can be employed within the decoder <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> When the image display apparatus is used as a liquid crystal display apparatus, the pixels <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> provided in the display region <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> can be each constructed by a condenser <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> that holds the voltage sampled by the pixel TFT <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, and a liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> interposed between the insulating substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the opposed substrate (transparent substrate), as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. The condenser <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> has its one end connected to a ground line <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> so that the voltage sampled by the pixel TFT <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> can be stably held for one-frame period. The liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> has its one end connected to a common electrode <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> so that the difference voltage between the voltage held on the condenser <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and a voltage Vc applied on the common electrode <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can be applied across the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. Thereby, it is possible to change the light transmission factor of the liquid crystal layer (liquid crystal) <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> to display the image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> When the image display apparatus is used as a self-emitting type display apparatus, the pixels <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> can be each constructed by a condenser <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> for holding the voltage sampled by the pixel TFT <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, a voltage/current conversion circuit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> for converting the voltage sampled by the pixel TFT <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> into the current, and a light-emitting layer <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. The one ends of the condenser <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the light-emitting layer <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> are connected to a ground line <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and the voltage from a power source line <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is applied to the voltage/current conversion circuit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. When the external voltage is applied between the power source line <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and the ground line <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and the sampled voltage is held on the condenser <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, the light emission intensity of the light emitting layer <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> can be changed in accordance with the held voltage, thus displaying the image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> When the image is displayed on the display region <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the circuits of the image display apparatus operate as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. First, as the multi-tone image data, the odd-numbered image data is applied to the data line Data-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the decoder <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and the even-numbered image data is applied to the data line Data-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the decoder <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. For example, when a row of image data &num;1-&num;6, which are displayed on the display region <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, are &lsqb;2, 3, 4, 2, 1, n&rsqb; from left to right in turn, the image data &lsqb;2, 4, 1&rsqb; is fed to the data line Data-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and the image data &lsqb;3, 2, n&rsqb; is fed to the data line Data-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. When the image data is decoded by the decoder <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, one of the switch drive lines D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to Dn-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is turned &ldquo;1&rdquo;, and one of the switch drive lines D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to Dn-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> turned &ldquo;1&rdquo;, as the switch drive lines selected by the image data. The shift register <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, in synchronism with the input of this image data, outputs the trigger pulses on the trigger lines Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-Q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in turn. When the trigger pulses are sequentially output, the n-channel TFTs tr<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> connected to the trigger lines Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-Q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are turned ON, thus sequentially sampling the data on the switch drive lines. Of the switch circuits SW connected to the trigger lines Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-Q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the switch circuits SW with data of &ldquo;1&rdquo; produced on the switch drive lines stores the data of &ldquo;1&rdquo; corresponding to the image data. Further, the switch circuits SW with data of &ldquo;1&rdquo; produced on the switch drive lines stores data of &ldquo;0&rdquo;. These stored data are held until these data are sampled again. During this interval, the TFTs tr<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the switch circuits SW that have stored data of &ldquo;1&rdquo; are turned ON. Thereby, the gradation voltages on the gradation voltage lines, which are connected to the switch circuits SW with data of &ldquo;1&rdquo; stored, of the gradation voltage lines LV<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-LVn are applied to the output lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> In other words, according to the trigger pulses that start to be fed from time t<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, the gradation voltages are sequentially fed to the output lines X<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-X<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and then fed to the signal lines S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. At time t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> when the first trigger pulse is generated from the trigger line Q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the gradation voltages &lsqb;V<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, V<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, V<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, V<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, Vn&rsqb; corresponding to the image data &lsqb;2, 3, 4, 2, 1, n&rsqb; are applied to all the signal lines S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> During the process in which the gradation voltages are applied to the signal lines S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the scanning circuit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> sequentially produces the scanning pulses on the scanning lines G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and G<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> at intervals of one-line period. The one-line period is each of the time interval t<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>-t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the time interval t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-t<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The scanning line G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is turned &ldquo;1&rdquo; during the one-line period t<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>-t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and the scanning line G<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> turned &ldquo;1&rdquo; during the next one-line period t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-t<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> When the scanning line G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is &ldquo;1&rdquo;, the path between the source electrode and the drain electrode in each of the first row pixel TFTs <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> which are connected to the scanning line G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> becomes conductive. Thereby, the gradation voltages from the signal lines S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are written in the first row pixels <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> during the time interval t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> at the latest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Similarly, during the time interval t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-t<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the gradation voltages &lsqb;V<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, Vn, V<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, V<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&rsqb; corresponding to the image data &lsqb;2, 1, n, 4, 3, 1&rsqb; are applied to all the signal lines S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> by time t<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The gradation voltages from the signal lines S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are written in the second row pixels <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> during the time interval t<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-t<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> at the latest. By the repetition of the above operations, it is possible to apply the aimed voltages to the pixels <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> in the whole display region <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, so that it is possible to display the image in the whole display region <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> When the image display apparatus is driven, the drive frequency of the decoder <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is the same as the frequency of the image data fed via the data lines Data-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and Data-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The switch circuits SW are respectively driven once during one-line period by the trigger pulses on the trigger lines. In this case, since at least two data are inputted during one-line period, the drive frequency of the decoder <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is twice the drive frequency of the switch circuits SW, or more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Here, when the image display apparatus is used as the liquid crystal display apparatus, the voltages to be applied to the pixels <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are necessary to be the AC voltages with the polarities inverted every field. It is necessary to apply the AC voltages to the liquid crystal so that the light transmission factor can be changed by the root mean square values of the AC voltage. When the AC voltages with the polarities inverted every field are applied to the pixels, one of the following two methods can be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> In the first method for the application of AC voltages, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, the voltages to the pixels <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are inverted every field by fixing the fixed voltage Vc applied to the common electrode <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (the common electrode <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>). The voltage V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is the maximum voltage, and Vn is the minimum voltage. When the high AC voltage value Vmax is applied to the pixels <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the voltages V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and Vn are alternately produced every field as indicated by the line (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). When the low AC voltage value Vmin is applied to the pixels <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the voltages V(n/2) and V&lsqb;(n/2)&plus;l&rsqb; are alternately produced every field as indicated by the line (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> In this case, the decoders <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> operate according to the logic shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. In other words, the outputs out-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to out-(n/2) and the outputs out-((n/2)&plus;1) to out-n are switched at the odd-numbered field period and the even-numbered field period. Also, in this case, n is twice the gradation number that the image display apparatus can display. If the gradation bit number is 6 bits, the gradation number is 64. Thus, n&equals;128. There is also a method for the AC voltage application in which two voltage values are alternately applied every field to the gradation voltage lines. In this case, n is the same as the gradation number that the image display apparatus can display. For example, if the gradation bit number is 6 bits, the gradation number is 64. Thus, n&equals;64. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> In the second method for the AC voltage application, the common voltage Vc (the voltage applied to the common electrode <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>) is changed to the AC voltage as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. In this case, the voltage range on the gradation voltage line becomes narrow enough to reduce the voltages to the circuits and the power consumption thereon. Here, V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is the maximum voltage, and the Vn is the minimum voltage. When the high AC voltage value Vmax is applied to the pixels, the voltage V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is produced every field period during which the common voltage Vc is the low voltage, and the voltage Vn is produced every field period during which the common voltage Vc is the high voltage, as shown by the line (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). When the AC voltage value Vmax is applied to the pixels <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the voltages are applied with the combination opposite to that in the line (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), as shown by the line (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> When the gradation number is &ldquo;8&rdquo; and the gradation voltages are asymmetrical with respect to the input data, the gradation voltages having the characteristics shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> are selected. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, there are eight different output voltages in each of the odd-numbered fields, and there are eight different output voltages in each of the even-numbered fields. Further, four ones of the output voltages in the odd-numbered fields take the same values as those in the even-numbered fields, so that the four voltages can be used common to the odd-numbered and the even-numbered fields. In other words, when the voltages common to the odd-numbered and even-numbered fields are not used, eighteen different voltages are necessary. On the other hand, when the voltages V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, V<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, V<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and V<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are used common to the odd-numbered and the even-numbered fields, only twelve different voltages are enough for the gradation voltages. Thus, the number of the necessary gradation voltage lines is n&equals;12. In this case, the decoders <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> operate according to the logic shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>. For example, in each of the odd-numbered fields, the signal for selecting the voltage V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is generated for the gradation &ldquo;1&rdquo;, and the signal for selecting the voltage V<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is generated for the gradation &ldquo;2&rdquo;. Similarly, the signals for sequentially selecting the voltages V<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, V<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, V<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, V<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, V<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and V<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are generated for the gradations &ldquo;3&rdquo;, &ldquo;4&rdquo;, &ldquo;5&rdquo;, &ldquo;6&rdquo;, &ldquo;7&rdquo; and &ldquo;8&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> The gradation number may be arbitrary, and the necessary number of the different voltages (namely, the number n of the gradation voltage lines) depends on the number of the voltages that can be used common to the odd-numbered and the even-numbered fields. The maximum number is twice the gradation number, and the minimum number is equal to the gradation number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> shows an example of the circuit layout of the DA converter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. This example illustrates only the region including two switch circuits SW in the lateral direction, and four switch circuits SW in the longitudinal direction with respect to the drawing sheet. The gradation voltage lines LV<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and LV<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and the switch drive lines D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are the metal wiring lines formed as the same layer to run in the lateral direction with respect to the drawing sheet. The switch drive lines transmit the fast signals, and the gradation voltage lines are grounded on the AC basis. However, since the length of the wiring line is required to be long in the lateral direction, the switch drive lines and the gradation voltage lines that are formed in the lateral direction are made of preferably aluminum or copper in order to reduce their resistance. The trigger lines Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the output lines X<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-X<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are made of the metal wiring lines formed as the same layer as the metal wiring lines forming the gates of the TFTs, and are formed in the longitudinal direction to intersect the gradation voltage lines and the switch drive lines. The switch circuits SW are formed in each of the spaces between the switch drive line D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the gradation voltage line LV<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, between the gradation voltage line LV<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the switch drive line D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, between the switch drive line D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the gradation voltage line LV<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and between the gradation voltage line LV<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the switch drive line D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In each of the switch circuits SW, two n-channel TFTs tr<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and tr<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are formed, and are connected by the metal wiring lines and the gate metal film according to the circuit diagram shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The TFTs tr<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and tr<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are formed at the intersections of the polysilicon film and the gate metal film. The polysilicon film in the regions other than the intersections with the gate metal film has phosphorus doped to form the n-channel TFT. The condenser Cm is formed in the region in which the metal wiring lines for the gradation voltage lines, and the gate metal film (the electrode formed as the wiring layer different from the gradation voltage lines) are overlapped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> The layout rule of the metal wiring lines is 4-&mgr;m space and 4-&mgr;m line width. The pitch of the switch circuits SW in the lateral direction with respect to the drawing sheet is 84 &mgr;m. Since one pitch of the switch circuits SW corresponds to two pixels, the pitch of the pixels is half that, or 42 &mgr;m. Thus, the image display apparatus can be constructed to have the high definition of 200 pixels/inch or more. In other words, the increase of the gradation number will result in the increase of the numbers of the switch circuits SW, the gradation voltage lines and the switch drive lines. However, according to this embodiment, the numbers of the output lines and the trigger lines does not increase due to the increase of the gradation number, so that this pitch is not affected by the increase of the gradation bit number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> According to this embodiment, even when the image display apparatus is of the multi-tone display type, the number of the wiring lines in the longitudinal direction with respect to the drawing sheet is always 1.5 per signal line irrespective of the gradation number. That is, the wiring lines in the longitudinal direction are three lines (i.e., the output lines X<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and X<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the trigger line Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) relative to two signal lines S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, so that the number thereof is 1.5 wiring lines per signal line. Thus, the space for the wiring is only (4&plus;4)&times;1.5&equals;12 &mgr;m when the layout rule is, for example, 4-&mgr;m space and 4-&mgr;m line width, and hence even the image display apparatus of 200 pixels/inch can have the circuit forming space of 30 &mgr;m per line. Therefore, the image display apparatus can be constructed to have the high definition of over 200 pixels/inch based on the vertical color stripe pixels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> In addition, even when the gradation bit number is &ldquo;6&rdquo;, the number of the transistors of the DA converter 4 per signal line can be made as small as 2&times;64&equals;125. The width of the DA converter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in the longitudinal direction with respect to the drawing sheet is 52 &mgr;m&times;64&equals;3.584 mm, and thus the area to be occupied by the non-display region of the image display apparatus can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Each switch drive line has three intersections <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> with the longitudinal lines including two signal lines, or 1.5 intersections occur per signal line. That is, the wiring lines that intersect are only two output lines and one trigger line. In addition, since two switch drive lines are provided in parallel on both sides of each gradation voltage line, the switch drive lines never intersect each other. Therefore, the number of the intersections between the wiring lines is constant irrespective of the increase of the gradation number n. Accordingly, even though the image display apparatus display is of the multi-tone display type, the number of the intersections (i.e., the intersection capacitance) can be reduced, so that it is possible to reduce the power consumption due to the transmission of the fast signals on the switch drive lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Moreover, according to this embodiment, the number of the state changes in n switch drive lines connected to each of the decoders <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is maximum &ldquo;2&rdquo;, and 2&times;(1&minus;(1/n)) in average. Here, 1/n indicates the probability at which the same data occurs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> According to this embodiment, the maximum change of the gradation bit number is two or more, and the average bit value is four or more, thus the number of the changes being small. In other words, since each of the decoders <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> produces the signal of &ldquo;1&rdquo; on the single switch drive line alone, the number of the data change times can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Therefore, as compared with the conventional system in which the multi-tone data is inputted as the binary data via the data bus, this embodiment can reduce the power consumption to the maximum value of 2 bits or more or to the average value of 4 bits or more. Accordingly, even when the multi-tone images are displayed, the power consumption can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> In addition, according to this embodiment, when the decoder <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is constituted as the external IC <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, it is similarly possible to reduce the power consumption caused when the parasitic capacitance of the flexible cable, via which the external IC <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the image display apparatus are connected, is driven. Accordingly, it is possible to reduce the power consumption due to the transmission of the fast signals on the external wiring line such as a flexible cable <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> The second embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>. In this embodiment, a DA converter <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> in place of the DA converter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and a decoder <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> in place of the decoder <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are provided in the non-display region of an insulating substrate <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. The constructions of the other portions are the same as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>, only the arrangement concerned with the signal lines S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> The decoder <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is constructed to produce data of &ldquo;1&rdquo; (switch drive signal) on one of n switch drive lines D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-Dn and data of &ldquo;0&rdquo; on the other switch drive lines, when the multi-tone image data is inputted on a data line Data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> The DA converter <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> has n gradation voltage lines LV<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-LVn, n switch drive lines D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-Dn, trigger lines Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-Q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, output lines X<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-X<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, ground lines GND, and pulse lines LP. The ground line GND, the pulse line LP, and the gradation voltage lines LV<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-LVn are provided in parallel with the respective switch drive lines. The trigger lines Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-Q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the output lines X<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-X<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are arranged in parallel with each other in the direction in such a manner that these lines intersect the above-mentioned lateral lines. In addition, switch circuits SL are formed in the regions near the intersections of those lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> The switch drive lines D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-Dn are connected to the output ends of the decoder <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, the trigger lines Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-Q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are connected to the output ends of the shift register <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and the output lines X<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-X<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are connected to the signal lines S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> The switch drive lines and the gradation voltage lines are arranged such that under the condition of the arbitrary natural number i&lE;n, the switch drive line Di is in parallel with the i-th gradation voltage line LVi. The different voltages V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-Vn are applied to the gradation voltage lines LV<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-LVn as the gradation voltages which correspond to the display gradations, like the above-mentioned embodiment. The low voltage corresponding to data of &ldquo;0&rdquo; are applied to the ground lines GND, and the pulses necessary for the level shift operation in the switch circuits LS are applied to the pulse lines LP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> The switch circuit SL includes n-channel TFTs tr<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-tr<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and a condenser (electrostatic capacity) C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. This-switch circuit SL has a function to serve as switching means for selecting a specified gradation voltage line in response to the trigger signal and data (switch drive signal) from the switch drive line, and also a function to serve as a level shifter (voltage level conversion means) for amplifying the voltage on the switch drive line. The gate electrodes of the TFTs tr<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and tr<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are connected to the trigger line Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. When the trigger pulse (trigger signal) is fed via the trigger line Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, those TFTs sample the voltages on the switch drive line D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the ground line GND in synchronism with this trigger pulse so that those voltages can be applied to the ends a and b of the condenser C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, respectively. The opposite ends of the condenser C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are connected to the gate and drain electrodes of the TFT tr<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, respectively. The voltage at the end b of the condenser C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is shifted in level by the pulse on the pulse line LP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> The source and drain electrodes of the TFT tr<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are connected to the gradation voltage line LV<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the output line X<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, respectively. The TFT tr<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> can serve as a switch that is controlled in its ON/OFF state by the voltage at the end b of the condenser C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> so as to connect or disconnect the gradation voltage line LV<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the output line X<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In other words, the TFT tr<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is turned ON (conductive) when the high voltage is applied to the end b, and OFF (nonconductive) when the low voltage is applied thereto. The switch circuits SL arranged in a matrix shape at all the intersections of the output lines X<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-X<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the switch drive lines D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-Dn are similarly constructed as above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> The level shift operation in the switch circuit SL will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>. First, when the pulse of voltage VDD is applied on the trigger line Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> connected to the switch circuit SL, the voltage produced by sampling the switch drive line D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> appears at the point a, and the voltage of 0 V produced by sampling the ground line GND appears at the point b, as described above. The logic on the switch drive line is &ldquo;1&rdquo; or &ldquo;0&rdquo;, and the voltage of &ldquo;1&rdquo; is the voltage Vsig that is smaller than VDD but larger than at least the threshold voltage of the TFT tr<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. This voltage Ssig is usually smaller than 3 V. Therefore, when the voltage on the switch drive line is &ldquo;1&rdquo;, the voltage on the switch drive line is sampled so that the voltage at the point a is Vsig. When the voltage on the switch drive line is &ldquo;0&rdquo;, the voltage on the switch drive line is sampled so that the voltage at the point a is 0 V. After the completion of sampling, the pulse of voltage VDD is applied on the pulse line LP. Here, when the voltage at the point a is Vsig, the TFT tr<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is turned ON, and thus the voltage at the point b increases. The voltage at the point a is also risen through the condenser C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and further the increase of the voltage at the point b is accelerated. Then, finally the voltage at the point b is stabilized to be VDD, and the voltage at the point a to be Vsig&plus;VDD. When the voltage at the point a is 0 V, the TFT tr<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is-turned OFF, and thus the voltage at the point b remains 0 V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> By the above operations, the switch circuit SL can convert the voltage of amplitude Vsig on the switch drive line into the signal of amplitude VDD. Thus, when the voltage VDD is high, the TFT tr<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> can be switched ON/OFF to control the wider range of the voltage on the gradation voltage line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> When the image is displayed, the circuits of the image display apparatus operate as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>. When the multi-tone image data is fed to the input data line Data of the decoder <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> in the order of, for example, &lsqb;2, 4, 1&rsqb; as the lateral row of the image data &num;1-&num;3 to be displayed from left to right, the image data fed to the data line Data is decoded by the decoder <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. Then, according to the logic of the decoding, the signal of &ldquo;1&rdquo; is produced on one of the switch drive lines D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-Dn, and the signal of &ldquo;0&rdquo; on the other switch drive lines. When the shift register <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> sequentially produces the trigger pulses on the trigger lines Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-Q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in synchronism with the inputting of this image data, the TFTs tr<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the TFTs tr<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> connected to the trigger lines Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-Q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are turned ON. Of the switch circuits SL, data of &ldquo;1&rdquo; is stored in the switch circuits SL connected to the switch drive line on which data of &ldquo;1&rdquo; is produced, and data of &ldquo;0&rdquo; is stored in the other switch circuits SL. These data are held until they are again sampled. During this period, the TFTs tr<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the switch circuits SL in which data of &ldquo;1&rdquo; is stored are turned ON. As a result, of the gradation voltage lines V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-Vn, the gradation voltage from one gradation voltage line connected to the switch circuits SL in which data of &ldquo;1&rdquo; is stored is supplied to the output lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> When the pulse is fed on the pulse line LP after time t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> at which the generation of the trigger pulses fed on the trigger lines Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-Q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is completed, the switch circuit SL in which data of &ldquo;1&rdquo; is stored performs the level shift operation as described above. As a result, the gradation voltages are generated on all the output lines X<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-X<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the gradation voltages &lsqb;V<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, V<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&rsqb; corresponding to the image data &lsqb;2, 4, 1&rsqb; are supplied to all the signal lines S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> In the process in which the gradation voltages are supplied to the signal lines S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the scanning lines G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and G<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are alternately supplied thereon with the scanning pulse from the scanning circuit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> at every line periods. Each of the time periods t<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>-t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-t<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is one-line period. The scanning line G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is &ldquo;1&rdquo; during one line period of time t<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>-t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and then the scanning line G<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is &ldquo;1&rdquo; during one-line period of time t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-t<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. When the scanning line G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is &ldquo;1&rdquo;, the pixel TFTs <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> connected to the scanning line G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> have theirs source-drain paths made conductive, so that the gradation voltages from the signal lines S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are written in the first row of pixels <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> by time t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> at the latest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> Similarly, during one-line period of time t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-t<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the gradation voltages &lsqb;V<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, Vn, V<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&rsqb; corresponding to the image data &lsqb;2, n, 3&rsqb; are supplied to all the signal lines S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in the time period t<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-t<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and the gradation voltages from the signal lines S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are written in the second row of the pixels <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> by time t<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> at the latest. By the repetition of the above operations, it is possible to apply the aimed voltages to all the pixels <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> in the display region <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, thus displaying the image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> When the image display apparatus according to this embodiment is driven, the drive frequency of the decoder <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is the same as the frequency of the image data inputted via the data line Data. The switch circuits SL are once driven by the trigger pulses from the trigger lines during one line period. In addition, since at least two data are inputted during one line period, the drive frequency of the decoder <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is twice that of the switch circuits SL or more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> When the image display apparatus according to this embodiment is used as the liquid crystal display apparatus, the AC voltage with the polarities inverted every field is applied to each of the pixels <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. The light transmission factor of the liquid crystal can be changed by applying the root mean square value of this AC voltage to the liquid crystal. For this AC mode, the same method as in the first embodiment can be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference> shows an example of the circuit layout of the DA converter <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> in this embodiment. This example illustrates only the region including two switch circuits SL in the lateral direction and two switch circuits in the longitudinal direction with respect to the drawing sheet. The gradation voltage lines LV<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and LV<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the switch drive lines D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the ground lines GND, and the pulse lines LP are made of the metal wiring lines as the same layer, and are formed in the lateral direction. The fast signals are transmitted on the switch drive lines, and the gradation voltage lines are grounded on the AC basis. Since the wiring lines are necessary to be long in the lateral direction with respect to the drawing sheet, the wiring lines in the lateral direction are made of preferably aluminum or copper in order to have low resistance. The trigger lines Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the output lines X<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and X<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are made of the metal wiring lines formed as the same layer as those forming the gates of the TFTs, and are arranged in the longitudinal direction to intersect the gradation voltage lines and the switch drive lines. The switch circuits SL are formed in each of the spaces between the switch drive line D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the gradation voltage line LV<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and between the switch drive line D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the gradation voltage line LV<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> The switch circuit SL includes four n-channel TFTs tr<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-tr<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and is connected by using the metal wiring lines and the gate metal film according to the circuit diagram shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>. The TFT tri<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the TFT tr<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are formed at the intersections of the polysilicon film and the gate metal film. The polysilicon film formed in the regions other than the vicinities of the intersections with the gate metal film is doped with phosphorus to form the n-channel TFTs. The condenser C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is formed at the overlap region of the metal wiring lines and the gate metal film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> The layout rule of the metal wiring line is 4-&mgr;m spacing and 4-&mgr;m line width. The pitch of the switch circuits SL in the lateral direction with respect to the drawing sheet is 64 pm. Therefore, the image display apparatus as shown in the example of the circuit layout can be constructed to have the high definition of about 130 pixels/inch based on the pixels of the vertical color stripes. In this case, the numbers of the switch circuits SL, the gradation voltage lines and the switch drive lines increase with the increase of the gradation number, but the numbers of the output lines and the trigger lines do not increase. Thus, this pitch is not affected by the increase of the gradation bit number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> In other words, even when the multi-tone image is displayed, the number of the wiring lines in the longitudinal direction with respect to the drawing sheet is always &ldquo;2&rdquo; per signal line irrespective of the gradation number. Thus, the space necessary for the wiring lines is (4&plus;4)&times;2&equals;16 &mgr;m in which is smaller than 42 &mgr;m, under the layout rule of 4-&mgr;m spacing and 4-&mgr;m line width, for example. Therefore, although the layout shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference> has the definition of about 130 pixels/inch, the definition can be increased to over 200 pixels/inch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> In addition, the number of the intersections of the switch drive lines in this embodiment is &ldquo;2&rdquo; per signal line, as shown at intersections <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>. The wiring lines that intersect are two output lines and one trigger line. Moreover, since two switch drive lines are provided in parallel on both sides of each gradation voltage line, respectively, the switch drive lines never intersect each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> Also, when the numbers of the power supply lines and the common signal lines such as the ground lines GND and the pulse lines LP are increased, those lines can be arranged in parallel with the switch drive lines. Thus, the number of the intersections of the switch drive lines are never increased. Therefore, the number of the lines intersected is unchanged even when the gradation number n is increased. Thus, even when the image display apparatus is of the multi-tone display type, the lines intersected, or the intersection line capacitance can be decreased. As a result, it is possible to reduce the power consumption on the switch drive lines on which the fast signals are transmitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> Moreover, according to this embodiment, the number of the data change times on the n switch drive lines connected to one single decoder <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is maximum &ldquo;2&rdquo;, and 2&times;(1&minus;(1/n)) in average. That is, in this embodiment, the maximum gradation bit number is two or more, and the average gradation bit number is four or more, thus the number of changes being small. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> As compared with the conventional system in which the multi-tone image data is inputted as the binary data via the data bus, the maximum power consumption is 2 bits or more, and the average power consumption is 4 bits or more in this embodiment. Accordingly, it is possible to reduce the power consumption even when the multi-tone image is displayed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> In addition, when the decoder <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is constructed as the external IC <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, the power consumption due to the drive of the parasitic capacitance of the flexible cable via which the external IC <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the image display apparatus are connected can be reduced. Accordingly, it is possible to reduce the power consumption of the fast signals on the external wiring line such as a flexible cable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> Moreover, according to this embodiment, since the logic voltage of &ldquo;1&rdquo; on the switch drive lines can be reduced to the threshold voltage of the TFT tr<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the amplitude of the signal voltage on the switch drive lines can be decreased. Thus, it is possible to reduce the power consumption on the switch drive lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> The third embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>. In this embodiment, shift registers <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> in place of the shift register <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, decoders <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> in place of the decoder <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and a DA converter <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> in place of the DA converter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are formed in the non-display region of an insulating substrate <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. The constructions of the other portions are the same as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In this embodiment, only the arrangement concerned with the signal lines S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> Each of the shift register <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> is constructed by using inverters, clocked inverters, and AND gates as in the first embodiment to sequentially produce the trigger pulses on the trigger lines Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, Q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and Q<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in synchronism with the image data input. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> The decoders <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> have the same arrangements as the decoders <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, respectively. In response to the multi-tone image data, data of &ldquo;1&rdquo; is produced on one of the switch drive lines D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to Dn-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to Dn-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and data of &ldquo;0&rdquo; is produced on the other switch drive lines. The decoders <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> are disposed to oppose each other with the DA converter <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> interposed between them. Each of the decoder <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> may be constructed as the external IC <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> The DA converter <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> has n gradation voltage lines LV<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-LVn, 2&times;n switch drive lines D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to Dn-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to Dn-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, trigger lines Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-Q<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and output lines X<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-X<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The switch drive lines D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to Dn-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are connected to the output ends of the decoder <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The switch drive lines D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to Dn-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are connected to the output ends of the decoder <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. The trigger lines Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-Q<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are connected to the output ends of the shift registers <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. The output lines X<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-X<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are connected to the signal lines S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> The switch drive lines D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to Dn-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to Dn-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are arranged in parallel with the gradation voltage lines LV<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-LVn. The trigger lines Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-Q<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the output lines X<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-X<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are arranged to intersect the switch drive lines D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to Dn-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to Dn-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The switch circuits SW are formed in the regions near the intersections of the wiring lines. The different voltages V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-Vn are applied on the gradation voltage lines LV<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-LVn as the gradation voltages corresponding to the display gradations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> The switch circuit SW is constructed of the n-channel TFTs tr<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and tr<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and the condenser Cm, like the first embodiment. However, the switch circuits SW connected to the output lines X<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and X<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are connected to the switch drive lines D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to Dn-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The switch circuits SW connected to the output lines X<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and X<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are connected to the switch drive lines D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to Dn-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the switch drive lines are divided into two separate regions, but the gradation voltage lines are used common to the two regions. Therefore, the image can be prevented from being irregular due to the very small differences between the gradation voltages. The switch drive lines may be divided into more than two regions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> The circuits of the image display apparatus are operated as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference> to display the image on the display region <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. As the multi-tone image data, the left and right halves of the image are fed to the input end of the decoders <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> via the data lines Data-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and Data-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, respectively. When the image data &num;1-&num;4 of the first row to be displayed are &lsqb;2, 4, 3, 2&rsqb; from left to right in turn, image data of &lsqb;2, 4&rsqb; and image data of &lsqb;3, 2&rsqb; are fed via the data lines Data-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and Data-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, respectively. These data are decoded by the decoders <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, respectively. According to the logic of the decoding, one of the switch drive lines D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to Dn-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and one of the switch drive lines D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to Dn-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are turned &ldquo;1&rdquo;, and the other lines are turned &ldquo;0&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> At this time, the trigger pulses are supplied from the shift registers <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> to the trigger lines Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the trigger lines Q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and Q<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in synchronism with the inputting of the image data. When the trigger pulses are sequentially fed to the trigger lines, data of &ldquo;1&rdquo; is stored in the switch circuits SW connected to the switch drive lines of &ldquo;1&rdquo;, of the switch circuits SW to which the trigger pulses are applied. On the other hand, data of &ldquo;0&rdquo; is stored in all of the other switch circuits connected to the switch drive lines of &ldquo;0&rdquo;. These stored data are held until they are again sampled. During this interval, the TFTs tr<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the switch circuits SW in which &ldquo;1&rdquo; is stored are turned ON. As a result, the gradation voltages on the gradation voltage lines connected to the switch circuits SW in which &ldquo;1&rdquo; is stored, of the gradation voltage lines LV<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-LVn, are supplied to the corresponding output lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> In other words, the gradation voltages are sequentially fed to the output lines X<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-X<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> according to the trigger pulses generated from time t<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, and are supplied to the signal lines S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. At time t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> at which the final trigger pulses are fed to the trigger lines Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and Q<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the generation of the trigger pulses ends, the gradation voltages &lsqb;V<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, V<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, V<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, V<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&rsqb; corresponding to the image data &lsqb;2, 4, 3, 2&rsqb; are fed to all the signal lines S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> In the process in which the gradation voltages are fed to the signal lines, the scanning pulses are sequentially produced from the scanning circuit <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> to the scanning lines G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and G<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> every line period. One-line period is each of the time periods t<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>-t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-t<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The scanning line G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> becomes &ldquo;1&rdquo; during one-line period from time t<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to time t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and the scanning line G<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is turned &ldquo;1&rdquo; during one-line period from time t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to time t<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. When the scanning line G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is &ldquo;1&rdquo;, one row of the pixel TFTs <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> connected to the scanning line G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> have their source-drain paths made conductive. As a result, the gradation voltages from the signal lines S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are written in the row of the pixels <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> during the time period t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> at the latest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> Similarly, during the time period t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-t<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the gradation voltages &lsqb;V<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, Vn, V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, V<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&rsqb; corresponding to the image data &lsqb;2, n, 1, 4&rsqb; are supplied to all the signal lines S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> by time t<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Further, the gradation voltages on the signal lines S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are written in the second row of the pixels <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> during the time period t<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-t<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> at the latest. By the repetition of the above operations, it is possible to apply the aimed voltages to the pixels <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of all the display region <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and to display the image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> When the image display apparatus according to this embodiment is driven, the frequency of the decoders <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> is the same as that of the image data fed via the data lines Data-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and Data-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The switch circuits SW are driven by the trigger pulses from the trigger lines once per line period. Therefore, since at least two data are fed in each line period, the drive frequency of the decoders <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> is twice that of the switch circuits SW, or more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> When the image display apparatus according to this embodiment is used as the liquid crystal display apparatus, the AC voltages with the polarities inverted every field are applied to the pixels <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, and-the root means square values of the AC voltages are applied to drive the liquid crystal. Thereby, the light transmission factor of the liquid crystal is changed. The method of the AC application may be the same as that in the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> In addition, according to this embodiment, the output line X<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is directly coupled to the signal line S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. However, a distribution circuit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may be provided as means for distributing the voltage on the single output line to two signal lines S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>. The voltage on the output line X<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can also be distributed similarly. By employing such circuit arrangement, it is possible to reduce the number of the circuit elements of the DA converter <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. However, since the operation in one-line period as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference> must be made twice in one-line period, the circuit operation is performed with twice the speed as high. The voltage on the single output line may be distributed to two or more signal lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> According to this embodiment, even if the image display apparatus is of the multi-tone display type, two wiring lines in the longitudinal direction with respect to the drawing sheet are always used per signal line irrespective of the number of the gradations. Thus, when the layout rule is 4-&mgr;m spacing and 4-&mgr;m line width, the space necessary for the wiring is only (4&plus;4)&times;2&equals;16 &mgr;m in width, which is smaller than 42 &mgr;m, for example. Therefore, this embodiment can display the image with the high definition over 200 pixels/inch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the number of the intersections of the switch drive lines in this embodiment is two per signal line, like in the second embodiment. The intersection wiring lines are two output lines and one trigger line only. Since two switch drive lines are provided in parallel on both sides of the gradation voltage line, the switch drive lines never intersect each other. Therefore, the number of the intersection wiring lines is constant irrespective of the increase of the gradation number n. Thus, even when the image display apparatus is of the multi-tone display type, the intersection lines (i.e., the intersection wiring capacitance) becomes small, so that it is possible to reduce the power consumption on the switch drive lines on which the fast signals are transmitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> In addition, according to this embodiment, the number of the data changes (the number of the state changes) on n switch drive lines connected to each of the decoder <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> is maximum &ldquo;2&rdquo;, and the average value thereof is 2&times;(1&minus;(1/n)). In other words, according to this embodiment, the maximum gradation bit number is two or more, and the average gradation bit number is four or more. Thus, it is possible to reduce the number of the changes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> Therefore, as compared with the conventional system in which the multi-tone data is inputted as the binary data via the data bus, the maximum power consumption is 2 bits or more and the average power consumption is 4 bits or more according to this embodiment. Therefore, it is possible to reduce the power consumption even in the image display apparatus which displays the multi-tone image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> Also, when the decoders <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> are constructed as the external IC <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, the power consumed when the parasitic capacitance of the flexible cable connecting the external IC and the image display apparatus is driven can also be reduced. Thus, it is possible to reduce the power consumption when the fast signal is transmitted on the external line such as a flexible cable. </paragraph>
