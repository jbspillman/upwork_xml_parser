<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention concerns generally, and according to the first of its aspects, the cement industry. More specifically, the invention concerns, according to its first aspect, a manufacturing process of a cement from a first raw mix formed from a mixture consisting of the compounds CaCO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>and/or Al(OH)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, CaSO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and/or a product containing silica or silicates such as clay, all these compounds being present in anhydrous or hydrated form, individually or in combination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Cements of this type, which are called sulfoaluminate cements, have been used since 1974 for constructions in China. These cements form a new class of construction materials which are different from the portland cements, which have been known for approximately 150 years, or aluminous cements invented by the Lafarge Company at the beginning of the 20<highlight><superscript>th </superscript></highlight>century. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The preparation of cement includes cooking of a base or raw mixture. The quality of the heat treatment for transformation of this raw mix into clinker will be determined to obtain cement with satisfactory mechanical properties during its use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The kilns usually encountered in cement making are tubular and rotary. These kilns have been used for more than fifty years for the preparation of portland cements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In a known way, a raw mix for obtaining sulfoaluminate cement is introduced at the first end of the center of an approximately horizontal tubular kiln in the form of flour, then is heated by the combustion gases derived from a burner placed at a second end of the center. The center of the tubular kiln is mounted so that it rotates around its axis of symmetry and is slightly inclined towards the burner, such that the rotation of the tube causes the rotation and the fall of the flour towards the burner at the second end of the center. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In proportion to its progression in the kiln, the flour is reheated and successively undergoes dehydration, decarbonation and clinkering. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, because of the variability of the speed of movement of the flour in the center, this type of kiln does not make it possible to obtain a clinker of constant quality. In fact, it turns out that the flour remains stuck to the walls of the kiln and has a prolonged residence time. Likewise, the flour can go more rapidly from the first to the second end of the kiln without having been treated satisfactorily. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The use of raw mixes containing iron oxides to obtain ferroaluminate cements under conditions similar to those described above for the preparation of sulfoaluminate cements leads to worsening of the problems of sticking to the walls of the kiln. An increased crusting of the kiln is then observable, particularly in the clinkering zone where the iron oxides are in the liquid state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Another solution can consist of using a kiln with a fixed center in which the raw mix is brought progressively to the clinkering temperature, then cooled and milled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> This technique has the drawback of being expensive because of the heat losses connected with the heating then the cooling of the kiln between each cycle. Furthermore, the operating method of this type of kiln is not suitable for production of large amounts of clinker. Since the mixture to be clinkered is immovable, heterogeneous zones appear in the clinker because of local variations in the temperature in the kiln. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In this context, the invention has the goal of proposing a process enabling the production of sulfoaluminate cement of constant quality under industrially acceptable conditions. These conditions include minimizing the consumption of energy which is a determining parameter in the cost of the cement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> To this end, the cement manufacturing process according to the invention moreover conforms to the generic definition that is given in the preamble above, is essentially characterized in that the mixture is treated up to the clinkering by movement in a kiln center, with a sheet of approximately constant thickness, at approximately constant speed, along a treatment path subjected to a positive gradient of temperature, and during a treatment time during which this mixture remains below its melting temperature, and in which the clinkered material forming a sulfoaluminate cement is cooled upon exit of the treatment path. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Such a process makes it possible to improve the respective drawbacks of the tubular kiln with a rotary center and kilns with a fixed center, by the movement at controlled speed of a predetermined amount of mixture to be clinkered in an atmosphere at controlled temperature and which can be regulated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, even because of the layout of the kiln, it is possible to vary the composition of the hot gases circulating in the center, and therefore, the selection of a locally oxidizing or reducing atmosphere; for example, by evacuating the flue gases produced in the clinkering zone in any of the parts of the kiln or even by varying the oxygen content during combustion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In addition, the mixture can consist of Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>(SO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>in anhydrous or hydrated form. Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>(SO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>can represent up to 10 wt % of the mixture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The composition to be treated by the process according to the invention can in addition consist of at least one mineral phase high in at least one iron oxidation product to obtain a second raw mix, said cement then forming ferroaluminate cement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In addition, the mixture can consist of an oxide of transition metal chosen from Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Cd, La, Hf, Ta and W. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The transition metal oxide can represent up to 5-10 wt % of the mixture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The process of the invention can consist of the preparation of the composition by steps of (i) mixing of each of its constituents with water to obtain a slurry, (ii) filtering said slurry to obtain a pasty residue, (iii) transforming said residue with a view to its introduction into the kiln. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> According to the process of the invention, the first pasty raw mix can be transformed by mixing then extrusion, preferably in plates or in strips with approximately constant thickness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The first pasty raw mix can also be extruded in the form of varied geometrical units, insofar as they make it possible to obtain a clinkered product of satisfactory quality at the end of the heat treatment because of the speed of diffusion of the heat to the interior of the section. Thus, cylindrical or ovoid rods or even hollow bricks can be appropriate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> During the use of a composition consisting of iron oxidation products, the second raw mix can be deposited before clinkering on an underlayer of the first raw mix. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the movement of the composition in the center of the kiln is carried out on rollers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The rollers present in a clinkering zone of the center of the kiln can be silicon carbide, possibly coated with silicon, or MgO&mdash;ZrO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Coatings of MgO&mdash;ZrO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>can be obtained by depositing under vacuum, according to a technique called CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The rollers present in a clinkering zone of the center of the kiln can be coated with a refractory stainless steel with a melting point higher than 1400&deg; C. These coatings of stainless steel can consist of sleeves mounted so that they each rotate freely around a roller. A preferred refractory stainless steel can be an alloy with a high content of nickel, for example, Inconel&reg;, Inconel 601&reg; or even Inconel 706&reg;. It has been observed that during use between 1300 and 1400&deg; C., the sleeves mounted to freely rotate could possibly yield but presented good mechanical resistance to plating, wearing and corrosion. Therefore, they are particularly adapted for the manufacture of cement by the process of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Because of the particular composition of the raw mixes used in the invention, it is necessary for the clinkering to be carried out in an oxidizing atmosphere. This oxidizing atmosphere is obtained with the aid of gaseous oxygen in the clinkering zone of the raw mix. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> According to the manufacturing process of the invention, the mixture undergoes, along the path of the treatment, successively, (I) possibly a drying and/or dehydration (II) decarbonation and (III) clinkering. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The clinkered mixture obtained by a process in conformance with the invention can be milled and mixed with limestone and/or gypsum and/or anhydrite and possibly heavy metals or oxidation compounds of heavy metals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> According to a second of these aspects, the invention concerns cement obtained according to a process in conformance with its first aspect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> According to a third of these aspects, the invention concerns a manufacturing installation of cement consisting of a tank and a mixer for preparing a first raw mix formed by a mixture consisting of the compounds CaCO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>and/or Al(OH)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, CaSO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and/or a product containing silica or silicates such as clay. All these compounds are present in anhydrous or hydrated form, individually or in combination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The installation consists of a kiln and a kiln center, to treat the mixture up to clinkering by movement in said kiln center. The movement is carried out with a sheet of approximately constant thickness, at approximately constant speed, along a treatment path subjected to a positive temperature gradient, and during a treatment time during which this mixture remains below its melting temperature. The installation consists of equipment for rapid cooling of the clinkered mixture upon exit from the treatment path. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The rapid cooling of the clinker can be advantageously carried out by means of cooled gaseous nitrogen or even liquid nitrogen. The nitrogen used for cooling the clinker can originate advantageously from the distillation of the air in an installation making it possible to simultaneously produce on the one hand, liquid or gaseous oxygen and on the other hand, liquid or gaseous nitrogen. The oxygen produced is used during the clinkering step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> According to a preferred embodiment method, the installation of the invention can include (i) a first mixer associated with a tank for obtaining a slurry during the combination of the mixture with the water, (ii) a filter press for filtration of said slurry in order to obtain a pasty residue and (iii) an extruder for transforming said pasty residue, with a view to its introduction into the kiln. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> This installation can in addition include a mixer for homogenization of the pasty residue derived from the filtration, and an extruder for its transformation into plates or strips with approximately constant thickness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The center of the kiln can include rollers for movement of the mixture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The installation according to the invention can use means for preparing a second cement raw mix including, in addition, at least one mineral phase high in at least one iron oxidation product. Such a second raw mix provides, after clinkering, a ferroaluminate cement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The installation according to the invention in addition can consist of means for depositing the second raw mix on an underlayer of the first raw mix before clinkering. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The installation according to the invention can use a first grinding mill of clinkered mixture, a second mixer in which there is added to the clinkered mixture milled limestone and/or gypsum and/or milled anhydrite, and possibly heavy metals or oxidation compounds of milled heavy metals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The invention uses several silos or hoppers, several conveyers, and several pipes for storage and transport of the products intended for the manufacture of sulfoaluminate cement.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The invention will be better understood and other goals, characteristics, details and advantages of the latter will appear more clearly during the description that will follow by referring to the diagrams attached, given only by way of nonlimiting examples and in which: </paragraph>

<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> diagrammatically represents a kiln <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in longitudinal section, including plates <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> which form the product before undergoing heat treatment. These plates <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are deposited on rollers <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which act to move them along a center <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the kiln <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Plates <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> enter the kiln by an inlet opening <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> where they undergo progressive reheating in a drying and/or dehydration zone <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> at a temperature going from approximately 250&deg; C. to approximately 500&deg; C. The plates <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> next go into a decarbonation zone <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> where they are brought to a higher temperature going from approximately 500&deg; C. to approximately 1000&deg; C. Finally, plates <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are led into an oxidizing atmosphere in clinkering zone <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> where they are brought to a temperature going from approximately 1000&deg; C. to approximately 1400&deg; C., without, however, passing through a pasty state usually occurring between 1300&deg; C. and 1350&deg; C. in the absence of compounds modifying the melting temperature of the mixture <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. It is desirable to avoid reaching the pasty state, because the latter is responsible for the phenomenon of clinker coating on the rollers <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In order to avoid clinker coating on the rollers in the clinkering zone <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, it is preferable to use rollers of silicon carbide or silicon carbide impregnated with silicon or MgO&mdash;Zr or any type of nonwetting coating for melted minerals contained in the solid raw mix; these melted minerals are responsible for the clinker coating on the rollers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The use of flux powders, especially those containing the elements boron, phosphorus, and fluorine, lowers the melting temperature of the mixture. In this case, the maximum temperature of the clinkering will be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Likewise, the use of certain compounds will increase the melting temperature of the mixture, for example, up to 1400-1500&deg; C. with, as a consequence, a modification of the proportions between the crystalline phases and the amorphous phases, as well as proportions of the mineral compounds forming the clinker. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, and not represented, the plates <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> can form an uninterrupted strip circulating in the drying and/or dehydration zone <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to the clinkering zone <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the center of the kiln. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The average residence time of the plates or strips <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in each of the zones <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is similar to that usually necessary during the use of rotary kilns. The residence time depends especially on the dimensions of the plates or strips <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, of the power of the kiln, of the heat capacity and the heat conductivity of the plates or strips <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and of the gases circulating in the center of the kiln. These parameters can be determined according to known techniques requiring knowledge of the mineral phases of different clinkers by specialists in the manufacturing of clinkers and cements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> After passage into the clinkering zone <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the plates <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> leave the kiln by a discharge opening <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> During the preparation of the cement, the second raw mix <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is preferably deposited on an underlayer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the first raw mix <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, before introduction into the kiln. This manner of proceeding makes it possible to avoid contact between the rollers and the second raw mix high in iron and responsible for clinker coating problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> According to a variant that is not represented, another solution to avoid clinker coating of the second raw mix on the rollers can consist of heat treatment of mixture <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in refractory boxes. In this case, the use of components of the mixture <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the form of dry or moist powder will be possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> According to another variant that is not represented, powders such as muscovites, talc, or even silica could also be deposited on at least one surface of the raw mix designed to be in contact with the rollers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> According to another variant, each of the rollers <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the clinkering zone <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be coated with a sleeve <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> made from refractory stainless steel. This sleeve <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is mounted so that it rotates freely around the roller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In order to limit heat losses, kiln <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is provided with pieces of refractory materials <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> which can be brick or asbestos. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> represents a summary diagram of an installation for implementation of a particularly preferred process in conformance with the invention, called &ldquo;by the wet route.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The cement manufacturing installation <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> consists of a tank <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and a first mixer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> for preparing a mixture <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The mixture <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> contains different constituents derived from silos or hoppers <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> in variable proportions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Thus, a first silo <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> contains an additive <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> in the form of a powder. This powder is obtained by milling the additive <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> in a second grinding mill <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The additive <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> can be formed by a compound of a transition metal chosen from Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Cd, La, Hf, Ta, and W. The transition metal compound will be preferentially chosen from hydroxides, oxides and sulfates. A more preferred transition metal compound will be an oxide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The transition metal oxide can represent up to 5-10 wt % of the mixture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The additive <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> is mixed with water before introduction into the tank <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Bauxite <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> is milled in a third grinding mill <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and then is stored in a second silo <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> A third silo <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> serves as a tank for the storage of gibbsite <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> after milling in the presence of water in a fourth grinding mill <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> A fourth silo <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> acts as reservoir for storage of clay-limestone fines <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> derived from limestone washing originating from limestone quarries. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Limestone <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is milled in a fifth grinding mill <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, then is stored in a fifth silo <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> A first part of gypsum <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is milled in the presence of water in sixth grinding mill <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, then is stored in a sixth silo or tank <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Finally, a seventh silo <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> contains a &ldquo;corrector&rdquo; intended to modify the physicochemical properties of the mixture <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> according to the qualities of the raw mixes, in order to ensure a product of a constant quality. This &ldquo;corrector&rdquo; is one of the products contained in silos <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Mixture <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> which forms slurry <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> after homogenization in the tank <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is collected by a pump <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. This latter sends the slurry <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> into a filter press <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The filter press <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, on the one hand, produces a filtrate <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> which returns toward, the tank <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and on the other hand, produces a pasty residue <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The pasty residue <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is next mixed in a mixer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, then is transformed with the aid of an extruder <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The extruder <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> produces plates or strips <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. These latter are then stored on average for two to three days, then are dried in a first drier <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> The dried plates or strips <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are next introduced into kiln <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to provide a clinker <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> after heat treatment. Clinker <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is next cooled in a rapid cooling apparatus <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> A suitable rapid cooling apparatus <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> can be a cooler with a fixed grid and reciprocating movable transverse bars, better known under the name of &ldquo;cross-bar coolers&reg;&rdquo; from the FLS Company (Copenhagen, Denmark). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Cooled clinker <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is then milled in a first grinding mill <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to provide a milled clinkered mixture <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The milled clinkered mixture <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is stored in an eleventh silo or hopper <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> The rapid cooling apparatus <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is fed with a cold fluid <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. This cold fluid <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> can be fresh air or sprayed liquid nitrogen. A reheated gas <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> obtained at the outlet of the cooling apparatus next acts to dry plates or strips <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in first drier <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. Wet gas obtained at the outlet of the drier is evacuated towards a first chimney <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> According to an embodiment method that is not represented, part of the reheated gas <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> derived from the rapid cooling apparatus <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> can be used as fuel for burners <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, installed on kiln <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, insofar as the reheated gas <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> contains oxygen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Burners <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> are fed with fuel <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. Fuel <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> can be advantageously natural gas or one of its separation products. Preferably, fuel <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> can be derived from industrial waste materials, such as fuels high in sulfur or even bone meal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> A second part of the gypsum <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is milled to dryness in seventh grinding mill <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, then is stored in an eighth silo <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The eighth silo <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> feeds a second drier <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> with gypsum. The second drier <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> is fed with hot combustion gases <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> coming from kiln <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Cooled combustion gases <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> are collected at the exit of the second drier <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>, then are dedusted in a dust extractor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The dust extractor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> can be a filtration apparatus, or an electrostatic precipitator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The gases derived from the dust extractor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> are next washed by spraying with water <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> in an apparatus for lessening the flue gases <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. According to variants that are not represented, it is possible to lessen the flue gas with limestone, gypsum, moist raw mix, or even chalk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> On the one hand, one collects washing water <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> which is sent to the tank <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and on the other hand, lessened dedusted flue gases <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> which are evacuated by a second chimney <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Dried gypsum <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> obtained at the exit of the second drier <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> is stored in a ninth silo <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. This latter feeds an eighth grinding mill <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> with dry gypsum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> The eighth grinding mill <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> is also fed with an additional component <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> stored in a tenth silo <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. This additional component <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> can be, for example, limestone, white limestone, dry borogypsum, dry phosphogypsum or even anhydrite. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> The additional compound <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and dry gypsum <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> are useful as additives for the preparation of the cement <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, especially of the modification of such properties as the intake speed or mechanical resistance. The quantities to be added are to be evaluated case by case, according to the needs, and are part of the general skills of the formulators of cement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> The eighth grinding mill <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> provides first flour <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight>, which feeds a second mixer <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, which is a powder mixer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> The second mixer <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is also fed (i) with a second flour <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> arising from the milling of the milled clinker <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in a ninth grinding mill <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, and (ii) with a third flour <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> arising from the milling in a tenth grinding mill <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> of an additive stored in a twelfth silo <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. This additive can be a transition metal oxide, or lead oxide, tin oxide, antimony oxide or bismuth oxide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> The twelfth silo <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> can be used for storage of compounds of heavy metals, for example, in the form of oxides or sulfides. The encapsulation of such compounds of heavy metals is possible because of the very low leaching observed during the use of cements obtained by a process in conformance with the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> The second mixer <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> produces a cement <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which is stored in a thirteenth silo <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. The cement <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is next removed from the thirteenth silo <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> to be packaged in bags or in bulk and leaves the installation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> According to an embodiment method that is not represented, the plates <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> can be prepared by compression of the constituents of the mixture <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the form of powder, and in the shape of a tablet. In this case, it is necessary to ensure good homogeneity of the powder. In order to improve the cohesion of the mixture <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> forming the plates, it is possible to carry out compression in the presence of steam. Of course, the step of mixing by the first mixer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in the tank <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is now useless, and the use of water is prohibited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> According to a variant that is not represented, the installation can comprise means for depositing a second raw mix <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> containing iron on an underlayer of a first raw mix <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> not containing a significant amount of iron before clinkering. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> For example, the deposit of a layer of the second raw mix <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> on an underlayer of the first raw mix <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> can be carried out at the time of the extrusion, or even during the storage step. </paragraph>
