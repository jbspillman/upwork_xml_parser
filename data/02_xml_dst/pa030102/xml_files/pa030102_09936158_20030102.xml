</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Conventional computer devices are connected to an external monitor device and input devices such as a keyboard and a mouse. A user operates the input devices corresponding to a display on the monitor device so as to cause application software to perform a data process or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Depending on a desired process and user&apos;s requirement, a plurality of computer devices may be activated and operated in parallel. In this case, from a viewpoint of the installation space of the monitor device and so forth, it is preferred to connect a plurality of computer devices to one monitor device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows an example of which two computer devices <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>B are connected to one monitor device <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> according to related art. In the following description, it is assumed that the computer devices are personal computers. The monitor device <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> can input two channels of video signals. A video signal <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>A that is output from the personal computer main body <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>A is input to a first video input terminal (not shown) of the monitor device. Likewise, a video signal <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>B that is output from the personal computer main body <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>B is input to a second video input terminal (not shown) of the monitor device <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A display portion <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight> of the monitor device <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> displays contents corresponding to the video signals that are input from the first and second video input terminals. The monitor device <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> has an operation switch <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> on its front panel. For example, by operating the operation switch <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>, an OSD (On Screen Display) screen <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> that represents settings of the monitor device <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> can be displayed in a predetermined area of the display portion <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight>. In addition, by operating the operation switch <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> in a predetermined manner, setting values of the monitor device <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> (for example, contrast, brightness, hue, and so forth) can be changed. Corresponding to the changed values, the display picture quality of the monitor device <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> are changed. In addition, a display of the OSD screen <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> is updated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> As input devices that allow a user&apos;s command to be input to the personal computer main body <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>A, a keyboard <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>A and a mouse <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>A are connected thereto. The keyboard <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>A transmits input key information to the personal computer main body <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>A. The mouse <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>A transmits the movement amounts in the (X, Y) directions of the mouse <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>A and button operation information thereof to the personal computer main body <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> For example, the personal computer main body <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>A converts the mouse movement amounts supplied from the mouse <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>A into coordinates on the display portion <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight> of the monitor device <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> so as to generate a video signal for displaying a cursor on the coordinates. The video signal for displaying the cursor is superimposed with the video signal <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>A. The superimposed signal is supplied to the monitor device <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. As a result, the monitor device <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> displays a cursor <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Likewise, a keyboard <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>B and a mouse <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>B are connected to the personal computer main body <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>B. Key information, mouse movement amounts, and button operation information are transmitted to the personal computer main body <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>B. In the same manner as the personal computer main body <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>A, the cursor <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> is displayed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In the related art shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the video signal is statically switched between the video signal <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>A of the personal computer main body <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>A and the video signal <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>B of the personal computer main body <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>B by operating for example the operation switch <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows an example of the structure of the above-described monitor device <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. The video signal <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>A that is output from the personal computer main body <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>A and the video signal <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>B that is output from the personal computer main body <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>B are input to a first input terminal and a second input terminal of a video switch <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>. The video switch <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> is controlled by a CPU <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight> (that will be described later) so as to select one of the video signals that are input to the first input terminal and the second input terminal. The selected video signal is output from the video switch <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> and supplied to a first input terminal of a video mix circuit <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The monitor device <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> has the above-mentioned CPU <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight>. A signal corresponding to the operation of the operation switch <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> is supplied to the CPU <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight>. When the operation of the operation switch <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> represents the switching between the personal computer main body <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>A and the personal computer main body <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>B, a control signal that causes an input to be switched is supplied from the CPU <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight> to the video switch <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> When the operation of the operation switch <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> represents the displaying of the OSD screen <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>, a command that causes the OSD screen <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> to be displayed is supplied from the CPU <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight> to a character generator <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>513</bold></highlight>. The character generator <highlight><bold>513</bold></highlight> generates a video signal for displaying the OSD screen <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> corresponding to the supplied command. The generated video signal is for example RGB signals. The video signal is supplied to a second input terminal of the video mix circuit <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The video mix circuit <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> switches the video signals supplied to the first and second input terminals at predetermined timings so that the OSD screen <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> is displayed at a predetermined area of the display portion <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight>. A video signal that is output from the video mix circuit <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> is supplied to a picture display device <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight> composed of for example a CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) or an LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) and a corresponding drive circuit through a display control circuit <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The picture display device <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight> causes the display portion <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight> to display a picture corresponding to the frequency and resolution of the supplied video signal. For example, the picture display device <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight> detects a horizontal synchronous signal and a vertical synchronous signal contained in the supplied video signal so as to obtain the horizontal frequency and vertical frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> When the settings of the monitor device <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> are changed by an operation of the operation switch <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>, a control signal corresponding to the changed settings is supplied form the CPU <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight> to the display control circuit <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight>. Corresponding to the control signal the video signal supplied to the display control circuit <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> is processed so as to adjust the display picture quality and so forth of the picture display device <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Since the computer devices <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>B are connected to the monitor device <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> in such a manner, when the user operates the operation switch <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> in a predetermined manner, the personal computer main bodies <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>B can be switchably operated. When the personal computer main body <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>A has been selected, the user can operate it using the mouse <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>A and the keyboard <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>A while observing the display of the monitor device <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. Likewise, when the personal computer main body <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>B has been selected, the user can operate it using the mouse <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>B and the keyboard <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>B while observing the display of the monitor device <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In addition, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, when a plurality of personal computer main bodies <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>B connected to the monitor device <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> are connected through a network <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>, a data communication can be performed between the personal computer main bodies <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>B. For example, a file can be transferred from the personal computer main body <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A to the personal computer main body <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>B through the network <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, even if a plurality of computer devices are connectable to one monitor device, the video switch that switches video signals of the plurality of computer devices that are connected is static as was described above. In addition, the frequencies of the video signals that are input from the plurality of computer devices are different and asynchronous. Thus, there is a problem of which video signals of a plurality of computer devices cannot be displayed on one monitor device at a time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In other words, conventionally, to display video signals of for example two computer devices at a time, it is inevitable to use two monitor devices corresponding to the computer devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In addition, conventionally, to operate a plurality of computer devices, a corresponding number of sets of input devices such as keyboards and mice are required. Thus, from view points of installation space and operability, the conventional method is not effective. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In addition, the signal formats of video signals supplied from a plurality of computer devices connected to one monitor device are subject to be different and asynchronous. In such a case, in particular, when the monitor device <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> uses a CRT as a picture display device, to switch a plurality of video signals, it takes a time to determine the system of the supplied video signals. Thus, conventionally, a plurality of video signals cannot be quickly switched. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In addition, even if two personal computers <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>B are connected to the monitor device <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>, since the monitor device <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> can display only a video signal supplied from only one personal computer, the user should operate the operation switch <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> so as to manually select one of the personal computers <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>B. Thus, even if the personal computer main body <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>A and the personal computer main body <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>B are connected through the network <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, when the user tries to operate a file between the two personal computers <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>B, the operation procedure becomes troublesome and takes a long time to switch the two personal computers. Consequently, the operability becomes low and the operation becomes inconvenient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Depending on the OS (Operating System) for use, to operate a file between two different personal computers, it is necessary to exchange data therebetween through a common folder that can be accessed from the two personal computers. For example, when a file of the personal computer <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>A is opened by an application of the personal computer <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>B, the user selects the signal <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>A using the operation switch <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>, causes a picture of the personal computer <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>A to be displayed, and moves or copies a desired file to the common folder. Thereafter, the user selects the signal <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>B using the operation switch <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> and causes the monitor device <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> to display the screen of the personal computer <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>B. Thereafter, the user opens the common folder, selects a desired file of the folder, and causes the application of the personal computer main body <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>B to open the selected file. Thus, according to the related art, even if data is transferred between the personal computer <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>A and the personal computer <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>B, the process becomes troublesome. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BEST MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Next, with reference to the accompanying drawings, a first embodiment of the present invention will be described. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> schematically shows an example of the operation of a monitor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to the first embodiment. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, two computer devices <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B are connected to the monitor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In the following description, it is assumed that the computer devices are personal computers. Video signals <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B that are output from the personal computers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B, respectively, are supplied to the monitor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The monitor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can display the video signals <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B in display areas <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B of a display portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> As input devices, a keyboard <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and a mouse <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are connected to the monitor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Thus, the keyboard <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the mouse <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are shared by the two personal computers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B. Key information <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is output from the keyboard <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Mouse movement amounts and button operation information <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are output from the mouse <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (hereinafter &ldquo;mouse movement amounts and button operation information&rdquo; is simply abbreviated to &ldquo;mouse information&rdquo;). The mouse information is supplied as an input operation signal <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A or <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>B to one of the personal computers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B that has been selected through the monitor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In addition, the monitor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has an OSD (On Screen Display) function. By operating an operation switch <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> disposed on the front side of the monitor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, an OSD screen <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is displayed. Corresponding to a display of the OSD screen <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, by performing a predetermined operation of the operation switch <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the settings of the monitor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be changed. In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, as the OSD screen <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, a control screen that allows the contrast of a picture on the display portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to be changed is displayed. By performing a predetermined operation of the operation switch <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the setting values of the contrast are changed. As a result, the contrast of the picture displayed on the display portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is changed and the control screen is updated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the monitor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is connected to the two personal computers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B. However, it is possible to connect more personal computers to the monitor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows an example of the structure of the monitor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to the first embodiment. Video signals <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B, . . . , and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>that are supplied from a plurality of personal computers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B, . . . , and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>(not shown) are supplied to a video memory interface <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The video memory interface <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> assigns the supplied video signals <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B, . . . , and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>to predetermined addresses of a frame memory <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and stores the video signals <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B, . . . , and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>to the assigned addresses thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> For simplicity, in the following description, it is assumed that two personal computers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B are connected to the monitor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In addition, it is assumed that the video signals <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B are stored to the frame memory <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The video memory interface <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> controls a read address of the frame memory <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> corresponding to a command received from a CPU (Central Processing Unit) <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (that will be described later) and reads a video signal for one screen from the frame memory <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The read video signal is supplied to a first input terminal of a video mix circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the key information <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the mouse information <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> that are output from the keyboard <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the mouse <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, respectively, are supplied to the CPU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The key information <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the mouse information <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are selectively output (as a signal <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A or <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>B) to one of the two personal computers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B that is determined as an active personal computer by the CPU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. One of the personal computers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B can be selected as an active personal computer by the operation switch <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> disposed on the front panel of the monitor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> A control signal <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that is output corresponding to the operation of the operation switch <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is supplied to the CPU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Corresponding to the control signal <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> issues a command that causes the OSD screen <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> to be displayed. The issued command is supplied to an OSD character generator <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. The OSD character generator <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> generates a video signal composed of for example RGB signals so as to display the OSD screen <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> corresponding to the supplied command. The video signal is supplied to a second input terminal of the above-described video mix circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The video mix circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> switches the video signals that are supplied to the first and second input terminals at predetermined timings so that the OSD screen <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is displayed at a predetermined area of the display portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. An output of the video mix circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is supplied to a picture display device <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> that is for example a CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) through a display control circuit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Corresponding to the supplied video signal, the picture display device <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> displays a picture on the display portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The display device <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may be an LCD (Liquid Crystal Display). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Corresponding to the supplied control signal <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> issues a command that causes the display control circuit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> to control the picture display device <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The issued command is supplied to the display control circuit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The display control circuit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> performs a process for the video signal supplied to the picture display device corresponding to the command. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> In reality, the CPU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is connected to a work memory, a ROM (Read Only Memory), and so forth (not shown). The CPU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> controls each portion of the monitor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> corresponding to a predetermined program that is pre-stored in the ROM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows an example of the structure of the video memory interface <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The video memory interface <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> has a plurality of input FIFO (First-In First-Out) memories <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>B, . . . , and <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>corresponding to the number of video signals that can be input to the monitor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In the following description, it is assumed that there are two channels of input video signals and that there are input FIFO memories <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>B. Two channels of video signals <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>B supplied to the video memory interface <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are temporarily stored to the input FIFO memories <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>B, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The video signals <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B are read from the input FIFO memories <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>B, respectively. The video signals <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B are supplied to a memory interface <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>. The video signals <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B supplied to the memory interface <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> are address-controlled by the memory interface <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> corresponding to a command issued by the CPU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and stored to the frame memory <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Likewise, a video signal for one screen is address-controlled by the memory interface <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and read from the frame memory <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The video signal for one screen that is read from the frame memory <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is temporarily stored to an output FIFO memory <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and then output therefrom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Since the FIFO memories <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>B, and <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> are used for an input and an output of the memory interface <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, the input and output can be clock-converted. Thus, the format of an input video signal can be freely converted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows an example of an address space of the frame memory <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and an example of an address assignment for reading a video signal from the frame memory <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The frame memory <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> has a storage capacity necessary for storing a video signal for a plurality of frames. In the example of which the two personal computers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B are connected to the monitor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the frame memory <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> has a storage capacity for storing a video signal for at least two frames (namely, two screens). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> An address space <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the frame memory <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is formed as for example a two-dimensional array corresponding to a displayed picture. In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the vertical direction of the video signal corresponds to the horizontal direction (namely, the column direction) of the two-dimensional array, whereas the horizontal direction of the video signal corresponds to the vertical direction (namely, the line direction) of the two-dimensional array. In addition, in the frame memory <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, a video signal for two screens is arranged in the column direction so that the upper right corner of the memory space shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is an address corresponding to the upper left corner of the display screen of the first video signal. Thus, by reading a video signal in the line direction, the first video signal and the second video signal can be successively read. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The video signal <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A that is output from the personal computer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A and the video signal <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B that is output from the personal computer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B are stored as the first video signal and the second video signal to the frame memory <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. A video signal <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A is stored in an address space <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>A shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, whereas a video signal <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B is stored in an address space <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>B. When an address range for one horizontal period (1H) is designated in the line direction, a video signal for one screen can be read. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> By changing the start point of a read address range, a video signal that is output can be quickly changed. FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> show examples displayed on the display portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. In FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the read address range in the address space <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> from which a video signal read from the frame memory <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is designated in different manners. By changing the start point of the address range in reading a video signal, as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, display areas <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B of the display portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are changed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</cross-reference> shows an example of which only a video signal <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A is displayed, whereas <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</cross-reference> shows an example of which only a video signal <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B is displayed. In the frame memory <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, when the address range in the line direction is designated for 1H in such a manner that an address M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is the read start address, a video signal can be read from only the address space <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>A. At that point, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>A, only a display area <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A of the video signal <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A is displayed on the display portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Likewise, when the address range in the line direction is designated for 1H in such a manner that the address M<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is the read start address, a video signal can be read from only the address space <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>B. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>B, only the display area <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B of the video signal <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B is displayed on the display portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Application software or the like superimpose video signals <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B that are output from the personal computers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B with video signals for displaying cursors at predetermined positions of the coordinates of the video signals <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</cross-reference>, cursors <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>B superimposed with the video signals <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B that are output from the personal computers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B are displayed in their display areas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows an example of which the display area <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A of the video signal <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A and the display area <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B of the video signal <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B are displayed at a time. By designating the address range in the line direction for 1H in such a manner that the read start address is address M in the address space <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>A, the video signals <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B can be read in such a manner that they are mixed with a video signal for one screen. When the address M that is the read start address is moved in the address space <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>A, the ratio of the display areas <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B on the display portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> can be changed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A, 9B</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> When the read start address M is continuously changed, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A, 9B</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>C, displays can be continuously switched. As a result, the boundary of the display area <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A and the display area <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B can be scrolled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> When the two video signals <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B are displayed on the same screen as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the displays of the video signals <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B can be fixed. For example, cursors <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>B are displayed relatively at the same positions as those shown with the original video signals <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Depending on the access method of the address space <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the frame memory <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, as an example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, one display area (in this example, the display area <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B) can be displayed in another display area (in this example, the display area <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A). At that point, the display area <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B may be a reduced area or a partial area. When address assignments of the address spaces <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>B are changed corresponding to the display ranges of the display areas <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B, a screen as shown in FIG. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is displayed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is a flow chart showing an example of the above-described display control process. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11, 12</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the personal computers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B are denoted by PC1 and PC2, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Before executing the process of the flow chart, as an initial state, it is assumed that one of the video signals <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B is fully displayed on the display portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. In the example, the video signal <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A is fully displayed. In addition, it is assumed that the personal computer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A is in an active state of which the personal computer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A can be operated using the keyboard <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the mouse <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. In the active state, corresponding to the operation of the operation switch <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the monitor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a command that causes the display mode of the monitor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be switched from one-screen mode in which only one video signal is displayed on the display portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to two-screen mode in which the two video signals <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B are displayed at a time is issued by the CPU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. When the command is issued, the process of the flow chart shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is started. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> The command that causes the display mode to be switched to the two-screen mode may be issued corresponding to inputs of the keyboard <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the mouse <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> At step S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as the first step, it is determined which of the personal computers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B connected to the monitor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is currently active. The determination can be performed in such a manner that one of the personal computers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B to which the key information <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the keyboard <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the mouse information of the mouse <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are supplied is active. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, at step S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> as the next step, it is determined whether or not the personal computer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A is an active personal computer. When the determined result represents that the personal computer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A is an active personal computer, the flow of the process advances to step S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In contrast, when the determined result represents that the personal computer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A is not active (namely, the personal computer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B is an active personal computer), the flow of the process advances to step S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> In contrast, when the determined result at step S<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> represents that the scroll command is in ON state, the flow of the process advances to step S<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. At step S<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, it is determined in which direction the screen is scrolled. When the screen is scrolled in the right direction, the flow of the process advances to step S<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. When the screen is scrolled in the left direction, the flow of the process advances to step S<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> At steps S<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the read start address M is changed corresponding to the scroll direction. When the screen is scrolled in the right direction, at step S<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, address Mscr<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> corresponding to the scroll amount is added to the address M that has been set. In contrast, when the screen is scrolled in the left direction, at step S<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, address Mscr<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> corresponding to the scroll amount is subtracted from the address M that has been set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> When the read start address is changed at steps S<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the flow of the process advances to step S<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. At step S<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, the relation of the values of the read start address M and the addresses M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and M<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is determined. When the address M is larger than the address M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and smaller than the address M<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (namely, M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&lt;M&lt;M<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), the flow of the process advances to step S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> In contrast, when the read start address M is not in the above-described range, the flow of the process advances to step S<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. At step S<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the value of the read start address M is limited. In other words, when the value of the changed read start address M is equal to or smaller than the value of the address M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the value of the read start address M is set to the address M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In contrast, when the value of the changed read start address M is equal to or larger than the address M<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the value of the read start address M is set to the address M<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> In such a manner, the value of the changed read start address M is limited. When the screen is scrolled to the right end of the display area <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A or the left end of the display area <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B, the screen is prevented from being further scrolled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> At step S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> as the next step, it is determined whether or not the active personal computer that is one of the personal computers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B has been changed. When the determined result represents that the active personal computer has been changed, the flow of the process advances to step S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. At step S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the active personal computer is changed. In other words, the CPU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> changes the output destinations of the input key information <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and mouse information <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to the active personal computer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> At step S<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> as the next step, it is determined whether or not the two-screen mode has been turned off. When the two-screen mode has been turned off, a sequence of steps of the process is completed. For example, the read start address M of the frame memory <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is fixedly set to the address M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or M<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> depending on which of the personal computers is active. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> In contrast, when the determined result at step S<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> represents that the two-screen mode has been turned on, the flow of the process returns to step S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Corresponding to the read start address M changed at step S<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> or S<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, a video signal is read from the frame memory <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The process from step S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to step S<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is cyclically performed while the two-screen mode is in ON state in a period of for example one frame. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Next, with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 9</cross-reference>, the process after step S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the above-described flow chart will be described in more detail. It is assumed that the screen scroll has been turned on, that the screen has been scrolled, and that the read start address M is for example address <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. At step S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a video signal for one frame is read from the address M. In other words, the read end address is address <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> At that point, the display portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> displays a screen as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</cross-reference>. The read start address M corresponds to the left end of the screen of the display portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The area from the read start address M to the address M<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> corresponds to the display area <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A. In the display area <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A, a picture of the video signal <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A of the personal computer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A is displayed. In addition, the area from the address M<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the address <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> corresponds to the display area <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B. In the display area <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B, a picture of the video signal <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B of the personal computer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B is displayed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Now, it is assumed that the screen scroll has been turned on and that the read start address M has been changed at step S<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> or S<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. When the screen is scrolled in the right direction and the scroll amount Mscr<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is added to the read start address at step S<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, the read start address M becomes address <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. A video signal for one frame is read from the address <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Thus, as shown in an example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>B, the display area of the display portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is moved in the right direction of the address space <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> In contrast, when the screen is scrolled in the left direction and the scroll amount Mscr<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is subtracted from the read start address M at step S<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the read start address M becomes address <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. A video signal for one frame is read from the address <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. Thus, as shown in an example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>C, the display area of the display portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is moved in the left direction of the address space <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Next, a second embodiment of the present invention will be described. According to the second embodiment, an active personal computer is selected from personal computers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B and a scroll command for scrolling two screens of the two personal computers displayed at a time is issued using a mouse <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The system structure of the second embodiment applies to the system structure of the first embodiment described with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. For simplicity, in the second embodiment, similar portions to those of the first embodiment are denoted by similar reference numerals and their detailed description will be omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is a flow chart showing an example of a process according to the second embodiment. It is assumed that a monitor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has been set to two-screen mode corresponding to the operation of an operation switch <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The two-screen mode may be set by a predetermined software process of the personal computers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B. In addition, for simplicity, it is assumed that the screen of the monitor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has been scrolled by a process (that will be described later) and display areas <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B are displayed in a display portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> at a time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> At step S<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> as the first step, it is determined which of the personal computers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B connected to the monitor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is currently active. The determination can be performed in such a manner that one of the personal computers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B to which the key information <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the keyboard <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the mouse information of the mouse <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are supplied is active. In this example, it is assumed that the personal computer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A is an active personal computer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, at step S<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> as the next step, it is determined whether or not the personal computer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A is an active personal computer. When the determined result represents that the personal computer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A is an active personal computer, the flow of the process advances to step S<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. In contrast, when the determined result represents that the personal computer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A is not active (namely, the personal computer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B is an active personal computer), the flow of the process advances to step S<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> At steps S<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, the determinations corresponding to the X coordinates of the cursors of the personal computer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A and the personal computer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B are performed. At step S<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, it is determined whether or not the X coordinate of the cursor is the maximum value Xpc1max of the display area <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A. When the X coordinate of the cursor is X&equals;Xpc1max, the cursor is displayed at the right end of the display area <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A (namely, the cursor is displayed at the boundary between the display areas <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> When the determined result at step S<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> represents that the X coordinate of the cursor is X Xpc1max, the flow of the process advances to step S<highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. The active personal computer and the cursor control are changed from the personal computer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A to the personal computer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B. Thereafter, the flow of the process advances to step S<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> In contrast, when the determined result at step S<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> represents that the X coordinate of the cursor is not X&equals;Xpc1max, the current cursor coordinates are the cursor coordinates of the personal computer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A that is currently active. Thus, the flow of the process advances to step S<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> Likewise, at step S<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, it is determined whether or not the X coordinate of the cursor is the minimum value (X&equals;0) of the display area <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B. When the X coordinate of the cursor is X&equals;0, the cursor is displayed at the left end of the display area <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B (namely, the cursor is displayed at the boundary of the display areas <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A). When the determined result at step S<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> represents that the X coordinate of the cursor is X&equals;0, the flow of the process advances to step S<highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. The active personal computer and the cursor control are changed from the personal computer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B to the personal computer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A. Thereafter, the flow of the process advances to step S<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> Next, with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13, a</cross-reference> process corresponding to the X coordinate of the cursor will be described. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, the coordinates of the personal computer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A (PC1) and the personal computer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B (PC2) are denoted by coordinates PC1 (X. Y) and coordinates PC2 (X, Y), respectively. In addition, the coordinates of the display portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> (namely, the absolute coordinates of the display portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) are denoted by coordinates (x, y). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> On the display portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the coordinates at the upper left corner and the coordinates at the lower right corner are denoted by coordinates (0, 0) and coordinates (xmax, ymax), respectively. When the display areas <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B are displayed on the display portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, the right end of the display area <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A contacts the left end of the display area <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B. The contacted portion is a boundary portion <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Thus, the coordinates at any point <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>B on the boundary portion <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the display portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are (Xpc1max, Y) as the coordinates of the personal computer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A and coordinates (0, Y) as the coordinates of the personal computer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> As an example, it is assumed that in the initial state, the personal computer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B is active and that the cursor is displayed at an initial position <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>A. When the cursor is moved from the initial position <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>A to a position <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>C, the cursor exceeds the boundary portion <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Just when the cursor exceeds the boundary portion <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> (at a position <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>B) from the display area <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B to the display area <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A, the X coordinate of the cursor of the personal computer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B that is currently active becomes X&equals;0. Thus, the determined result at step S<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> represents that the active personal computer is the personal computer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B. Thereafter, the flow of the process advances to step S<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. At step S<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, it is determined that the X coordinate of the cursor is X&equals;0. Thus, at step S<highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, the active personal computer is changed from the personal computer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B to the personal computer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A. In addition, the cursor control is changed from the personal computer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B to the personal computer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A. Thus, the coordinates of the cursor are controlled with the coordinates of the personal computer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> When the cursor is moved so that the X coordinate of the cursor exceeds the boundary portion <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, the control can be switched between the personal computers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> Returning to the description of the flow chart shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, at step S<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, the coordinates (x, y) of the cursor of the display portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are obtained. At step S<highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> as the next step, the determination is performed corresponding to the x coordinate of the obtained cursor coordinates (x, y). At step S<highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, when the x coordinate of the cursor coordinates (x, y) is x&equals;0, the flow of the process advance to step S<highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The CPU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> issues a command that causes the screen to be scrolled in the left direction. When the x coordinate is x&equals;xmax, the flow of the process advances to step S<highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. The CPU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> issues a command that causes the screen to be scrolled in the right direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, when the cursor is at a position <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>D, the determined result at step S<highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> represents that the x coordinate of the cursor on the display portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is X&equals;0. At step S<highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, a command that causes the screen to be scrolled in the left direction is issued. Corresponding to the command, the read start address M of the frame memory <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is changed. Thus, the screen displayed on the display portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is moved in the left direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> The command issued by the CPU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is supplied to a video memory interface <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. As with the first embodiment, the read start address M of the frame memory <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is changed to a predetermined value and thereby the screen is correspondingly scrolled. Thus, when the cursor is positioned at the left end or right end of the display portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> by operating for example the mouse <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the screen can be scrolled in the direction of the cursor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> When the command is issued at steps S<highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> and the screen is scrolled, a sequence of steps of the process is completed. In addition, when the coordinates of the cursor are not one of the above-described values at step S<highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, a sequence of steps of the process is completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> As was described above, an OSD screen <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> can be displayed on the display portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> shows an example of the OSD screen <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> that is displayed. At that point, a dedicated cursor <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> for the operation of the OSD can be displayed on the OSD screen <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. Corresponding to a command issued by the CPU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a video signal for the cursor <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is generated by a character generator <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> along with a video signal for the OSD screen <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. A video mix circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> superimposes the video signal generated by the character generator <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> with the video signals of the personal computers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B. Alternatively, a dedicated character generator that generates the video signal for the cursor <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> may be additionally disposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> On the OSD screen <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, areas <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>B, and <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>C are input valid areas. When the coordinates for the cursor are present in the areas, an input using for example the button operation of the mouse <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be performed. In the example of which a contrast adjustment screen is displayed as the OSD screen <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> issues a command of which while the cursor is present at the area <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>A, when the button operation is performed, the contrast of the screen is decreased and of which while the cursor is present in the area <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>B, when the button operation is performed, the contrast of the screen is increased. The command is supplied from the CPU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to a display control circuit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> so as to control the display of the picture display device <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. In addition, the contrast values displayed in the display area <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> is updated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> The area <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>C is an area for an input that causes the mode for displaying the OSD screen <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, the OSD screen <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is displayed in an area having a predetermined size corresponding to the coordinates (x<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>, y<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>) of the display portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. When the cursor is present in the area, the coordinates (x<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>, y<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>) of the area of the cursor are obtained. Corresponding to the obtained coordinates, it is determined whether or not the cursor is in the input valid areas.

In other words, as long as a desired operation can be performed, the order of the steps of the process may be changed. In addition, in the above description, a file selection operation, a file movement operation, and a file movement confirmation operation are performed by the drag and drop operations of the mouse <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. However, those operations may be performed in different manners. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> For example, with key operations of the keyboard <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, the file movement can be designated.

<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> is a flow chart showing an example of a process for copying a file from the personal computer <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>A to the personal computer <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>B using the keyboard <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the mouse <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. At step S<highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> as the first step, a file to be copied is selected in a personal computer as the file copy source (in this example, the personal computer <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>A). As with the file movement process, when a file is selected, the mouse cursor <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight> is overlaid with the icon <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> that represents the file to be selected using the mouse <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and the button of the mouse <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is pressed. The button information of the mouse <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is received by the input portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and supplied to the communication portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>A through the control portion <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. The button information is sent from the communication portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>A to the personal computer <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>A through the control signal path <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> After the file to be copied has been selected, at step S<highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> as the next step, a copy command is issued by a use&apos;s operation. For example, a signal corresponding to a particular input that represents a copy operation to the keyboard <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is received by the input portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and supplied to the control portion <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. The control portion <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> recognizes the signal as a copy command. The recognized copy command is supplied to the communication portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>A through the internal bus <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> under the control of the control portion <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. The copy command that has been supplied to the communication portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>A is sent to the personal computer <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>A through the control signal path <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>A.

<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, key information corresponding to a key input to the keyboard <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be directly supplied to the communication portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>A and sent to the personal computer <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>A not through the control portion <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. The personal computer <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>A recognizes the copy command corresponding to the key information that has been sent. At that point, although the control portion <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> recognizes the copy command, it is not necessary to send a control signal from the control portion <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> to the personal computer <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> At step S<highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> as the next step, the personal computer as the operative object is switched from the personal computer <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>A to the personal computer <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>B. For example, by inputting a predetermined key to the keyboard <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, a command that causes the personal computer as an operative object to be switched is issued. The switch command is received by the input portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and then supplied to the control portion <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. The control portion <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> controls the internal bus <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and the communication portions <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>B corresponding to the switch command so as to switch the transmission destination of the input operation signal that is output from the input device <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> from the personal computer <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>A to the personal computer <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>B. Thus, after step S<highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, the personal computer that is operated by the user is switched from the personal computer <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>A to the personal computer <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> The switch command issued at step S<highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> may be sent from the control portion <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> to the personal computer <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>A through the communication portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>A so that the personal computer <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>A can recognize the switch command. In addition, when it is necessary to send the control signal to the personal computer <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>A so as to represent that the mouse <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> has not been moved, after step S<highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, a control signal that represents that the mouse <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> has not been moved is sent from the control portion <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> to the personal computer <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>A through the communication portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>A.

At that point, when the coordinates are stored to the control portion <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, the coordinates of the mouse cursor <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight> are calculated and stored as absolute coordinates of the display portion <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> corresponding to the synchronous frequency of the video signal <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> At step S<highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> as the next step, the mouse cursor <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight> is displayed in the display area <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>B of the personal computer <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>B to which the file is copied as the file copy destination. In addition, the icon <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> that represents the file selected at step S<highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is displayed at a position corresponding to the display coordinates of the mouse cursor <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight> of the display area <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>B. For example, the display coordinates of the mouse cursor <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight> in the display area <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>B are supplied from the control portion <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> to the communication portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>B and then sent to the personal computer <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>B. Alternatively, using the coordinates pre-stored in the personal computer <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>B, the mouse cursor <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight> may be displayed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> So far, the personal computer as the operative object is switched to the personal computer <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>B to which the file is copied as the file copy destination. Thus, the personal computer <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>B can be operated using the keyboard <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the mouse <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. At step S<highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>, corresponding to the operation of the mouse <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, the mouse cursor <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight> is moved to the display area <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>B. In other words, the drag operation of which while the button of the mouse <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is being pressed, the mouse <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is moved is performed. Information that represents the movement amounts of the mouse <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is received by the input portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, supplied to the communication portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>B through the control portion <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, and sent from the communication portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>B to the personal computer <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0208" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0208&rsqb;</number> At step S<highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, it is determined whether or not a paste command that causes the copied file to be pasted to the copy destination (namely, a command that causes the copied file to be stored to a storage medium such as a memory or a hard disk of the personal computer to which the copied file is stored) has been issued. When the determined result represents that the paste command has been issued, the flow of the process advances to step S<highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight> as the next step. As a result, the file that has been selected is transferred from the personal computer as the copy source to the personal computer as the copy destination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0209" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0209&rsqb;</number> The paste command is issued by performing a particular input to the keyboard <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. A signal corresponding to the particular input that represents the paste operation is received by the input portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The signal is supplied to the control portion <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and recognized as the paste command. The recognized paste command is supplied to the communication portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>B through the internal bus <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> under the control of the control portion <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. The paste command supplied to the communication portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>B is sent to the personal computer <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>B through the control signal path <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Thus, a desired position of the display area <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>B of the personal computer <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>B is stored as the display position of the copy destination of the icon <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> that represents the file to be copied to the personal computer <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0210" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0210&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, key information corresponding to a key input to the keyboard <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be directly supplied to the communication portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B not through the control portion <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and then sent to the personal computer <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>B. The personal computer <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>B recognizes the copy command corresponding to the key information that has been sent. At that point, although the control portion <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> recognizes the copy command, it is not necessary to cause the control portion <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> to send the control signal to the personal computer <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0211" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0211&rsqb;</number> When the determined result at step S<highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> represents that the control portion <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> has recognized the paste command, the control portion <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> notifies the personal computer <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>A through the control signal path <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>A that the transfer destination of the selected file is the personal computer <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>B. In addition, the control portion <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> notifies the personal computer <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>B through the control signal path <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>B that the transfer source of the file as an object of the paste command is the personal computer <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0212" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0212&rsqb;</number> In addition, the above-described paste command can be supplied to the personal computer <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>B so that the personal computer <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>B directly controls the paste process. At that point, for example, the personal computer <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>B requests the personal computer <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>A to transfer the selected file through the data transfer path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Corresponding to the request, the personal computer <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>A transfers the selected file to the personal computer <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0213" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0213&rsqb;</number> In the above description, various commands such as copy command, paste command, and personal computer switch command are issued by inputting predetermined keys to the keyboard <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. However, the present invention is not limited to such an example. Instead, the operation portion <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> of the monitor device <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> may issue such commands. Alternatively, predetermined button operations of the mouse <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> may allow such commands to be issued. </paragraph>

However, the present invention is not limited to such an example. For example, on the conventional OS, when the icon <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> that represents data corresponding to an application is overlaid with an icon <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>&prime; that represents the application by the drag operation, the application can be executed in the state that the data has been read. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0215" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0215&rsqb;</number> When the above-described process is performed on such an OS, an application of for example the personal computer <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>B can be executed with data read from the personal computer <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>A. In other words, the icon <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> that represents data and that is displayed in the display area <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>A is dragged from the display area <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>A to the display area <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>B. As the icon <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is moved from the display area <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>A to the display area <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>B, the personal computer as the operative object is switched from the personal computer <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>A to the personal computer <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0216" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0216&rsqb;</number> When the icon <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> that represents data overlaid with the icon <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>&prime; that represents an objective application in the display area <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>B, the button of the mouse <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is released and the icon <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> that represents the data is dropped to the icon <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>&prime; that represents the application When the drop operation is performed, the data represented by the icon <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is transferred from the personal computer <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>A to the personal computer <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>B. Thus, the data is passed to the application of the personal computer <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>B. As a result, the application is started in the state that data has been read. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0217" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0217&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, the display areas <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>B of the personal computers <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>B are displayed in such a manner that the display portion <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> of the monitor device <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> is horizontally divided. However, the present invention is not limited to such an example. Instead, the display areas <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>B may be displayed in such a manner that the display portion <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is vertically divided. As was described in the first embodiment, the ratio of the divided display areas <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>B may be changed by a predetermined operation using for example the mouse <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, by reducing the display areas <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>B in predetermined sizes, they can be fully arranged on the display portion <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

However, the present invention is not limited to such an example. Instead, the input device <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and the input portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> may bi-directionally communicate with each other. In this case, for example, the keyboard <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> as the input device <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> may have a display device such as an LED (Light Emitting Diode) or a simple LCD so that the control states of the personal computers <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>B and so forth by the monitor device are displayed on the display device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0320" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0320&rsqb;</number> As was described above, according to the first embodiment of the present invention, a frame memory is disposed in the monitor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In addition, an input and an output of the frame memory are performed through an FIFO. Thus, inputs of video signals whose formats such as frequencies, resolutions, and so forth are different can be displayed as a plurality of screens at a time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0321" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0321&rsqb;</number> When video signals for a plurality of screens are stored in the frame memory and the read start address of the frame memory is changed, a plurality of screens that are displayed can be scrolled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0322" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0322&rsqb;</number> In addition, according to the second embodiment of the present invention, the monitor device has an input interface for a keyboard and a mouse. Thus, key information of the keyboard, mouse movement amounts and button operation information of the mouse, and so forth are supplied to the monitor device.

Thus, the keyboard and the mouse can be shared by the plurality of personal computers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0323" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0323&rsqb;</number> Thus, when a plurality of personal computers are used at a time, it is not necessary to prepare an input means for each of the personal computers. As a result, the installation space can be remarkably reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0324" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0324&rsqb;</number> In addition, according to the second embodiment of the present invention, since the monitor device can obtain key information of the keyboard and the mouse movement amounts and button operation information of the mouse, two-screen display mode can be selected and an active personal computer can be switched using a cursor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0325" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0325&rsqb;</number> In addition, according to the third embodiment of the present invention, a plurality of computer devices can be connected to the monitor device. In addition, input devices such as a keyboard and a mouse can be connected to the monitor device. On the monitor device, display screens of the connected computer devices are displayed at a time. In addition, the monitor device selects one computer device as an operative object from a plurality of computer devices that are connected and supplies an output of an input device to the selected computer device. Moreover, corresponding to an output of the input device, data transfer is performed among the computer devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0326" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0326&rsqb;</number> Thus, when the monitor device according to the third embodiment is used, the user can switch a plurality of computer devices using one set of input devices without a deliberate operation. In addition, while observing the operation states of the plurality of computer devices, the user can perform an operation thereamong. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0327" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0327&rsqb;</number> In addition, on one screen, display screens of a plurality of computer devices are displayed at a time. Using one set of input devices, an icon operation and so forth can be freely performed among display screens of the computer devices. Thus, the user can seamlessly perform an operation among the plurality of computer devices. Thus, since the user does not need to perform a switch operation for the computer devices, the operability is improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0328" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0328&rsqb;</number> In addition, display screens of a plurality of computer devices are displayed on one screen at a time. Using one set of input devices, an icon operation and so forth can be freely performed among the display screens of the computer devices. Thus, the user can operate the plurality of computer devices as if he or she operates one computer device. </paragraph>
