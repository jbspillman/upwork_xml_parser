<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a softener composition for textiles. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> At present, domestic softener compositions are compositions based on a quaternary ammonium compound containing two long-chain alkyl groups in one molecule and being typified by di(hydrogenated tallow alkyl) dimethyl ammonium. The reason for use of such softener compositions is that the quaternary ammonium compound, even in a small amount, has a good softening effect on various fibers. However, these softener compositions suffer from the problem of oily finish of fibers and deterioration in water absorption properties of cotton towels etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> JP-B 4-28826 and JP-B 7-23584 disclose the technique of using a quaternary ammonium salt having an unsaturated alkyl chain as the means of improving water absorption properties, by which the water absorption properties of cotton towels are improved, but slimy feeling peculiar to the quaternary ammonium salt is still not solved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> JP-A 9-111660 describes use of a mixture of a polycation having at least one long-chain hydrophobic group and an anionic surfactant, but this technique also failed to satisfy water absorption properties and preferable feeling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, there is the problem that discoloration of clothes proceeds by repeated washing, resulting in deterioration in the appearance. This is due to the influence of residual chlorine present in tap water, and the technique of preventing discoloration by scavenging such residual chlorine has been found. JP-A 10-506966 discloses a softener composition comprising a chlorine scavenger. In respect of costs and storage stability, however, it was very unfavorable to incorporate a chlorine scavenger besides softening components into the softener composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> As an automatic laundering machine becomes distributed in recent years, there is an increasing opportunity to use a softener composition by introducing it into an automatic inlet, but if conventional softening components are used, they will remain in the inlet thus forming gel with time to cause clogging in the inlet or the problem of an aesthetically unfavorable appearance. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The object of the present invention is to provide a softener composition endowing clothes with a high softening effect and preferable feeling without deteriorating the water absorption properties of textiles. Further, the present invention provides a softener composition capable of endowing cotton in particular with a preferred softness, elasticity (fluffy feeling) and feeling of dryness with small oiliness while being excellent in the discoloration-preventing effect. Furthermore, the present invention can also provide a softener composition not causing gelation in an automatic inlet in a laundering machine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> That is, the present invention provides a softener composition which comprises a compound having one or more C<highlight><subscript>8-36 </subscript></highlight>hydrocarbon groups and two or more groups selected from an amino group and a quaternary ammonium group in the molecule (component (a)), an anionic surfactant having a C<highlight><subscript>8-36 </subscript></highlight>hydrocarbon group (component (b)) and a nonionic surfactant (component (c)), wherein the molar ratio of the component (a) to the component (b) is from 90/10 to 50/50. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> 2.5% by weight of a nonionic surfactant &lsqb;component (c)&rsqb; having about 20 molecules of ethylene oxide added to lauryl alcohol (Kalcol 2098 produced by Kao Corporation) and 3.0% by weight of ethylene glycol &lsqb;component (d), &dgr;&equals;37.9&rsqb; were added to water at 65&deg; C., and the components (a) and (b) in Table 1 were added thereto under stirring with stirring blades. Thereafter, 10 ppm coloring matter (Acid Blue 9), 0.3% by weight of a perfume &lsqb;that is, a mixture of hexyl cinnamic aldehyde (18), nerolin yarayara (4), tricyclodecenyl acetate (4), benzyl acetate (10), musk ketone (5), anisyl acetone (2), sandal mysolcore (2), aldehyde C14 peach (1), linalool (18), dihydroxy myrcenol (8), borneol (4), cedrol (4), mugoal (5), benzyl alcohol (5), and dipropylene glycol (10); weight-% in the perfume is shown in the brackets&rsqb; and 0.1% by weight of silicone (TSA730 produced by J. E. Toshiba Silicone Ltd.) were added thereto. Each mixture was adjusted to a predetermined pH value with hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide and then cooled to give each of the desired compositions. The resulting compositions were evaluated in the following manner. The results are shown in Table 2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> &lt;Treating Method&gt;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> 1 kg of commercially available cotton towels and 0.5 kg of jersey clothes made of acrylate fibers were laundered repeatedly 5 times with a commercially available detergent Attack&trade; (Kao Corporation) in hard water of 3.5&deg; DH at 20&deg; C. in a laundering machine having a capacity of 30 liters. Then, 7 g softener composition (the balance was water) shown in Table 1 was introduced thereinto at the time of final rinsing, followed by treating the towels and jersey clothes under stirring for 3 minutes. The cotton towels and jersey cloths made of acrylate fibers treated in this manner were air-dried at room temperature and then left in a constant temperature and humidity chamber at 25&deg; C. under 45% RH for 24 hours. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> The softness and oiliness of the resulting clothes were evaluated in a constant temperature and humidity chamber at 25&deg; C. under 45% RH by a paired comparison test using clothes treated with 7 g of a softener composition containing 15% by weight of di-hydrogenated tallow alkyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (the balance was water) as the control. In addition, the water absorption properties of clothes obtained in the same manner as above were also evaluated in the paired comparison test by wiping hands with the clothes. Evaluation was conducted by 10 a examiners, and the evaluation results were averaged and ranked according to the following criteria. The results are shown in Table 1. </paragraph>
