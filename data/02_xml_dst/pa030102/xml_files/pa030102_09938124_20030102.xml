<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a foundation filled cosmetic implement, and more particularly, to a foundation injector and a foundation filled cosmetic implement therewith, the cosmetic implement being formed by compactly integrating a illiquid type fountain into an implement used for putting the foundation on, the injector and the implement which can achieve a smooth discharge of a foundation filled in a body, reduce manufacturing cost and improve productivity by facilitating a manufacturing and assembling process of components comprised in the cosmetic implement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Background of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A foundation filled cosmetic implement wherein a liquid type foundation is integrated into a cosmetic implement is disclosed in Korean Patent Application No. 2001-19957. In that, a foundation injector for discharging the foundation is provided with a discharge valve for providing a discharge passage of the foundation to properly control the used volume of foundation filled in a body, and a pressurization pump for injecting the foundation to discharge the foundation through injection of compressed air. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The discharge valve provides the discharge passage of the foundation. Also, the discharge valve has a one-way discharge structure, such that the discharge of the foundation is permitted only when used for makeup. The pressurization pump is structured to compresses air to inject the foundation filled in the body in a direction where the discharge valve is positioned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In the foundation injector constructed as above, basically, the discharge valve and the pressurization pump are under airtight condition, respectively, for basic purpose of protecting the foundation filled in the body from being unintentionally discharged to the outside. There is inevitably generated an air gap between components of the discharge valve and the pressurization pump due to a difference in precision during assembling the components. In consequence, the more the number of components increases, the more defective proportion of products increases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The increase in the number of required components causes increase in manufacture time and cost. As a result, unit price is increased and productivity is accordingly decreased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Meantime, the pressurization pump has a one-way injecting structure through a spring and an open-and-shut mechanism, so as for the foundation not to be flowed into an inner space where air is compressed. However, this requires lots of money and time consumed in manufacturing and assembling the components. Further, the open-and-shut mechanism supported by the spring is structured to block an entrance into which the air is injected, causing loss of pressure on the compressed air and failing to sufficiently exhibit functions of the pressurization pump. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Meantime, the foundation injector includes a pressurization pump <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a discharge guide tube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and an injection nozzle <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The pressurization pump <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> receives a pressure from the outside for opening/shutting an open-and-shut mechanism <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the injection nozzle <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which will be explained herein after. The pressurization pump <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a valve tube <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a push button <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a spring <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a slide pin <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The valve tube <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is fixed on one side of the rear end part and has a perforated central part for the slide pin <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to be protruded to the outside. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The push button <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is installed on other side of the rear end part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to be reciprocated, and covers both opened end parts of the rear end part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> together with the valve tube <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The spring <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is interposed between the valve tube <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the push button <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to supply a restoring force to the push button <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. That is to say, even if the push button <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is pressed by an external force and forwardly moved toward the position where the valve tube <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is positioned, it is restored to its original position by the spring <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In consequence, the push button can be reciprocated with the external one-way pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The slide pin <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> reciprocates a push rod, which will be explained herein under, and is reciprocated in the perforated center of the valve tube <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by being coupled with the push button <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> As a result, the pressurization pump <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprised of the slide pin <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and components for reciprocating the slide pin <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> supplies a one-way pressure to the discharge guide tube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the pressurization pump <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> reciprocates the slide pin for the purpose of more certainly reciprocating the push rod <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. It is out of question, however, that an additional rubber (which is not shown) may be coupled with the push button to be closely adhered on an inner peripheral surface of the rear end part, thereby transferring compressed air within the rear end part as well as the pressure of the slide pin to the discharge guide tube. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Then, the discharge guide tube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> receives a reciprocation driving force from the pressurization pump <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and opens and shuts an open-and-shut mechanism <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, which will be explained herein after, to discharge the foundation filled within the body to the outside. The discharge guide tube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes a tube <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the push rod <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, a spring holder <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, a guide bush <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, a spring <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, and a cover <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The tube <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is fixed on the perforated portion of the valve tube <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, forms an outer appearance of the discharge guide tube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and is cylindrical in shape with both opened end parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The push rod <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> receives the one-way pressure of the slide pin <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> within the tube <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to be reciprocated and reciprocates the open-and-shut mechanism of the injection nozzle <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which will be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The spring holder <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is coupled on an end part of the push rod <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> contacted with the slide pin <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to prevent the spring <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> from being separated and reinforce a contact portion between the push rod <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the slide pin <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The guide bush <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is installed, such that the push rod <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is reciprocated in the tube <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The spring <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is interposed between the guide bush <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and the spring holder <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to supply a restoring force to the push rod <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. That is to say, the push rod <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is reciprocated in a manner that even if the push rod <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> receives the one-way pressure of the slide pin <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and is forwardly moved, the push rod <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is restored to its original position due to the restoring force. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The cover <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is coupled with an end part of the push rod <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and directly contacted to the open-and-shut mechanism <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the injection nozzle <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. A central part of the cover <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is perforated and a plurality of inlet holes <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and outlet holes <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>may be formed on the central part so as for the foundation filled within the body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be flowed in and out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the discharge guide tube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> discharges the foundation through the push rod <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, components for reciprocating the push rod <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and the cover <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> for permitting the foundation filled within the body to be flowed into the injection nozzle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the injection nozzle <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> acts as a discharger for discharging the foundation filled within the body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the outside and includes a nozzle <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, a spring <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the open-and-shut mechanism <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and a spring <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The nozzle <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> constitutes the body of the injection nozzle <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, is installed on the front end part <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to be reciprocated, and provides a discharge passage of the foundation through a flow channel <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> which is formed on a central part of the nozzle <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The spring <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is interposed between the front end part <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the nozzle <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to supply a restoring force to the nozzle <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. That is to say, once the push rod <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is forwardly moved and the nozzle <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is pressed, the open-and-shut mechanism <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is forwardly moved as far as a predetermined distance and the nozzle <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is forwardly moved along with the push rod <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, the nozzle is returned to its original position due to the restoring force of the spring <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The open-and-shut mechanism <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is interposed in the flow channel <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> of the nozzle <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and is reciprocated due to the pressure of the cover <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The injection nozzle <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> discharges the foundation according to the reciprocation of the open-and-shut mechanism <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The spring <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is interposed in the flow channel <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> of the nozzle <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to elastically support the open-and-shut mechanism <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. That is to say, even if the open-and-shut mechanism <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is forwardly moved by the pressure of the cover <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, it returns to its original position by the restoring force of the spring <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The spring <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is protected from being separated from the flow channel <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> of the nozzle <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> by virtue of a spring holder <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In consequence, the injection nozzle <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> receives the pressure of the push rod <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and guides the passage through which the foundation filled within the body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is to be discharged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Operation of the foundation filled cosmetic implement with the foundation injector according to the first preferred embodiment of the present invention will be explained herein below. To discharge the foundation filled within the body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for the purpose of wearing the foundation, it is needed that a necessary volume of foundation is injected to the applicator <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> by using the foundation injector according to the present invention. To operate the foundation injector, it is needed that the push button <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is pressed in one way. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> That is, if the push button <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is pressed, the slide pin <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is forwardly moved. If the slide pin <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is forwardly moved, the push rod <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is forwardly moved. If the push rod <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is forwardly moved, the cover is forwardly moved and the open-and-shut mechanism <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is forwardly moved. Meantime, once the open-and-shut mechanism <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is forwardly moved as far as a predetermined distance, the nozzle <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is forwardly moved, so that the foundation can be discharged in a state that an end part of the nozzle <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is exposed up to a deep portion of the applicator <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and a user can put the foundation on her face in a way of rubbing the applicator <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> on her skin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> To the contrary, if the external force pressing the push button <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is removed, the nozzle <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, the open-and-shut mechanism <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, the push rod <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and the push button <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are restored to their original positions by the respective springs <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> At this time, a noteworthy thing is the discharge passage of the foundation filled within the body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The foundation is penetrated through the inlet holes <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>into the inside of the cover <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> under the state that the foundation is first filled within the body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. If the push button <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is pressed to push the open-and-shut mechanism <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> toward the end of the cover <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, the foundation penetrated into the inside of the cover <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> can escape from the flow channel <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> of the nozzle <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> through the outlet holes <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. To the contrary, if the external force pressing the push button <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is removed to make the cover <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> withdrawn, the outlet holes <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>become blocked by the spring holder <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, resulting in elimination of possibility that the foundation may be discharged without intention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> In the meantime, an additional component of the discharge guide tube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> according to the present invention will be explained. A rubber <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> may be installed on an outer peripheral surface of the push rod <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to be closely adhered to an inner peripheral surface of the tube <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, such that the liquid foundation penetrated into the inside of the tube <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is flowed into the flow channel of the nozzle <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The rubber <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> may be fixed by means of a rubber holder <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. For the reason, the discharge guide tube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can perform the foundation discharging function in a smoother way through a pumping action of the rubber <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> In the same manner, an additional component of the injection nozzle <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> will be explained. A rubber <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is installed on an outer peripheral surface of the nozzle <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to be closely adhered to an inner peripheral surface of the front end part <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Even if the foundation is penetrated between the nozzle <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and the front end part <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the nozzle <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and the front end part <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are so airtight that the foundation may not be discharged to the outside. Of course, the rubber <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may be fixed by means of a rubber holder <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates an exploded cross view of a foundation filled cosmetic implement with a foundation injector according to a second preferred embodiment of the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> and FIGL.<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> illustrate sectional views of the foundation filled cosmetic implement with the foundation injector of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates a state that a rise and fall holder is raised, while <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates a state that the rise and fall holder is lowered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, the foundation filled cosmetic implement with the foundation injector according to the second preferred embodiment of the present invention has some different points in structure from the first embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> That is to say, the body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> providing a space in which the foundation is filled and the foundation injector for injecting the foundation filled within the body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to the second preferred embodiment are similar in structure to them of the first embodiment. However, the front end part of the body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is different in structure from that of the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The second preferred embodiment employs an auxiliary applicator which is raised and lowered through the rise and fall holder, in addition to the applicator used for wearing the foundation. The second preferred embodiment allows the user to smoothly put coloring by using the two kinds of applicators, even in case of a liquid foundation, which is difficult to be used for makeup because of relatively high concentration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Here, the auxiliary applicator may be a brush <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> formed of a bundle of soft cilia as shown in the drawings or may be a sponge, which is often used in the coloring makeup. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, the front end part according to the second preferred embodiment includes a guide container <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, the rise and fall holder <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, a rise and fall guide <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, and the auxiliary applicator. The two kinds of applicators may be used by turns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The guide container <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is coupled on an end part of the body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to form a frame of the front end part. A protrusion <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is formed on an outer peripheral surface of the guide container <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The rise and fall holder <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> surrounds the outer peripheral surface of the guide container <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and is coupled with the outer peripheral surface of the guide container <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> to be rotated. A spiral groove <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is formed on an inner peripheral surface of the rise and fall holder <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to be raised and lowered along the guide container <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and is engaged with the protrusion. A rise and fall jaw <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is formed on an outer peripheral surface of the rise and fall holder <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The rise and fall guide <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> surrounds the outer peripheral surface of the rise and fall holder <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and is coupled with the outer peripheral surface of the rise and fall holder <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to be rotated. A rise and fall groove <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is formed on an inner peripheral surface of the rise and fall guide to raise and lower the rise and fall holder <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> through the rise and fall jaw <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The auxiliary applicator is fixed on one side of the rise and fall holder <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to be raised and lowered along with the rise and fall holder <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. A brush <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is illustrated in the accompanying drawing as an exemplary form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The applicator according to the second preferred embodiment of the present invention is coupled with the end part of the guide container <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> by means of a holder <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, similarly in the first preferred embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Next, operation of the front end part according to the second preferred embodiment will be explained. The auxiliary applicator should be raised and lowered in order to use the applicator and the auxiliary applicator by turns. The auxiliary applicator can perform a rise and fall action relative to that of the applicator by rotating the rise and fall guide <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> If the rise and fall guide <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is rotated, the rise and fall holder <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is raised and lowered between the guide container <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the rise and fall guide <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, since the rise and fall jaw <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is engaged with the rise and fall groove <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the rise and fall guide <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and the spiral groove <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is engaged with the protrusion <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the guide container <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The rise and fall holder <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is raised and lowered due to normal and reverse rotations of the rise and fall guide <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. By way of example, if the rise and fall guide <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is normally rotated, the rise and fall holder <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is raised, whereas if the rise and fall guide <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is inversely rotated, the rise and fall holder <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is lowered. It is out of question that correlation between the normal and reverse rotations of the rise and fall guide <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and the rise and fall of the rise and fall holder <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is determined by whether the spiral groove <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the rise and fall holder <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is formed as a right hand screw or a left hand screw. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> In the result, the front end part of the second preferred embodiment enables the coloring makeup through the two kinds of applicators in a manner that if the applicator is used by rotating the rise and fall guide <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, the auxiliary applicator should be maximally lowered, whereas if the auxiliary applicator is used, the auxiliary applicator should be maximally raised. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Explanation of the foundation injector according to the second preferred embodiment of the present invention will be omitted because the foundation injector is similar in structure and function to the foundation injector according to the first preferred embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrate sectional views of a variation of the foundation filled cosmetic implement with the foundation injector of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Meantime, the second preferred embodiment explained through <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> may be easily varied into a structure in which there is raised and lowered a brush <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> which is positioned on a central part, in place of a rise and fall structure of the rise and fall holder <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> which raises and lowers the auxiliary applicator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> For reference, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, elements having the same or similar functions as those in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> have the same names and reference numerals.

The brush <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, namely the auxiliary applicator, fixed on an outer circumference of a fixed holder <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> relatively maintains the fixed state thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> That is to say, the rise and fall holder <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the injection nozzle <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> are varied into the fixed holder <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and the rise and fall valve tube <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, respectively. The fixed holder <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> fixes the brush <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, namely the auxiliary applicator which is positioned on the outer circumference of the fixed holder, and the rise and fall valve tube <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> raises and lowers the brush <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, which is positioned on the central part, through a sleeve <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> It is out of question that the sleeve <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> having a protrusion <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> on an outer peripheral surface thereof raises and lowers the rise and fall valve tube <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> by being raised and lowered due to rotation of the rise and fall guide <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> which has a spiral groove <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> engaged with the spiral groove <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> in an inner peripheral surface of the rise and fall guide <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. The sleeve <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> may be integrally manufactured with the rise and fall valve tube <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> And, the push rod <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> has a difference in function from the push rod illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. That is to say, the push rod <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is structured, such that the end part of the push rod <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> does not directly pressurize the open-and-shut mechanism <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> but the open-and-shut mechanism <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is opened and shut by transferring the foundation through reciprocation of the rubber <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, in consideration that position of the open-and-shut mechanism <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is varied by rise and fall of the rise and fall valve tube <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> The above is an exemplary embodiment. Therefore, the open-and-shut mechanism <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> may be directly pressurized by determining a length of the push rod <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in consideration of the position of the open-and-shut mechanism <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> when the rise and fall valve tube <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is maximally lowered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> illustrates an exploded cross view of a foundation filled cosmetic implement with a foundation injector according to a third preferred embodiment of the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> illustrate sectional views of the foundation filled cosmetic implement with the foundation injector of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. To be specific, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> illustrates a state that a rise and fall holder is raised, while <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> illustrates a state that the rise and fall holder is lowered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, the foundation filled cosmetic implement with the foundation injector according to the third preferred embodiment of the present invention is somewhat different in structure from the second preferred embodiment of the present invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Namely, the foundation filled cosmetic implement includes the body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for providing the space where the foundation is filled, the foundation injector for injecting the foundation filled within the body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the rise and fall holder <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> for raising and lowering the brush <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, the rise and fall guide <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, the guide container <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, etc., which are similar in structure to those of the second preferred embodiment. However, the brush <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> for applying the discharged foundation is replaced with a ball <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and accompanying components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> In order to avoid redundant description, components different from the second preferred embodiment will be just explained herein below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The ball <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is rotated in a state that it is closely adhered to one side of the guide container <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>by being inserted into the perforated central part of the guide container <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. It is natural that one side of the guide container <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> takes any shape adaptable for protecting the ball from being separated to the outside. The guide container <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the ball <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are structured, such that the foundation is discharged in the same manner that ball-point pen ink is discharged in necessary quantity through rotations of a ball. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> A support <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is inserted into the perforated central part of the guide container <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> together with the ball <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to support the ball <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, so that the ball can be rotated in a state that it is closely adhered to the one side within the guide container <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. A duct line <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which is perforated at one side thereof is formed on a central part of the support <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and a hole <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>being communicated with the duct line <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is formed on an outer peripheral surface of the support. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> A spring <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> supplies a restoring force to the support <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, so as to maintain the state that the ball <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is closely adhered to the one side of the guide container <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. The spring <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is interposed into the perforated central part of the guide container <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> in a state that it is positioned at one side of the support <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> A valve tube <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is finally inserted into the perforated central part of the guide container <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> as shown in drawings. The valve tube <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> serves to prevent the ball <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the support <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, the spring <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> which are interposed within the guide container <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> from being separated to the outside, and acts as a connecting path allowing the foundation filled within the body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to reach the position of the ball. The valve tube <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> has a duct line <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on a central part thereof, the duct line <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>being communicated with the duct line <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the support <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Here, an open-and-shut mechanism <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and a spring <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are interposed in the duct line <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the valve tube <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, such that the foundation is discharged in one way. The open-and-shut mechanism <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is reciprocated by the push rod <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, more directly by the pressure of the cover <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> as previously mentioned, and opens and shuts the duct line <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the valve tube <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> In the third preferred embodiment of the present invention as constructed above, if the foundation filled within the body is to be discharged, the discharge is conducted in a simple manner that the ball is rubbed on a portion to be applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> illustrate sectional views of a variation of the foundation filled cosmetic implement with the foundation injector of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Meantime, the third preferred embodiment explained through <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> may be easily varied into a structure in which there is raised and lowered the brush <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> which is positioned on the central part, in place of the rise and fall structure of the rise and fall holder <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> which raises and lowers the auxiliary applicator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> For reference, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, elements having the same or similar functions as those in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> have the same names and reference numerals. Hereinafter, redundant explanation of the elements having the same or similar functions would be avoided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> The ball <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is structured such that the ball <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is raised and lowered through rise and fall of a rise and fall valve tube <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. The brush <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, namely the auxiliary applicator, fixed on an outer circumference of a fixed holder <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> relatively maintains the fixed state thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> That is to say, the rise and fall holder <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the valve tube <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> are varied into the fixed holder <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> and the rise and fall valve tube <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, respectively. The fixed holder <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> fixes the brush <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, namely the auxiliary applicator which is positioned on the outer circumference, and the rise and fall valve tube <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> raises and lowers the ball <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> through a sleeve <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> It is out of question that the sleeve <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> having a protrusion <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> on an outer peripheral surface thereof raises and lowers the rise and fall valve tube <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> by being raised and lowered due to rotation of the rise and fall guide <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> which has a spiral groove <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> engaged with the spiral groove <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> in the inner peripheral surface of the rise and fall guide <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. The sleeve <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> may be integrally manufactured with the rise and fall valve tube <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> And, the push rod <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> has a difference in function from the push rod illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. That is to say, the push rod <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is structured such that the end part of the push rod <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> does not directly pressurize the open-and-shut mechanism <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> but the open-and-shut mechanism <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is opened and shut by transferring the foundation through reciprocation of the rubber <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, in consideration that position of the open-and-shut mechanism <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is varied by rise and fall of the rise and fall valve tube <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> However, the above is an exemplary embodiment. Therefore, the open-and-shut mechanism <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> may be directly pressurized by determining a length of the push rod <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in consideration of the position of the open-and-shut mechanism <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> when the rise and fall valve tube <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is maximally lowered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Unexplained reference numerals <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> represent protective caps for protecting the brushes <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, and reference numerals <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are packing. Unexplained reference numerals <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> represent tubes for providing a discharge passage of the foundation. In addition, unexplained reference numerals <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> represent fixing mechanisms for preventing the rubber <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> from being separated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> As stated above, the present invention has one advantage of maintaining the airtight condition where the foundation is not discharged to the outside without intension and achieving a smooth discharge of the foundation, since the open-and-shut mechanism is opened and shut under the pressure of the cover on which the inlet holes and the outlet holes are formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> The present invention has another advantage of enhancing force efficiency and securing a sure discharge of the foundation, since the nozzle is surely opened and shut by the slide pin and the push rod, and thus has no loss of pressure of the compressed air, if being compared with the simple air compressing type foundation injection method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> The present invention has yet another advantage of reducing increasing unit price due to increase in the required components, since the injection nozzle, the discharge guide tube and the pressure pump have mutual organic airtight means in contrast to the existing injection structure where various components for injecting the foundation have separate means for maintaining the airtight condition, and enhancing productivity, since the manufacturing and assembling process is relatively fast carried out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> The forgoing embodiments are merely exemplary and are not to be construed as limiting the present invention. The present teachings can be readily applied to other types of apparatuses. The description of the present invention is intended to be illustrative, and not to limit the scope of the claims. Many alternatives, modifications, and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
